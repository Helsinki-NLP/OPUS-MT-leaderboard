House counselors are concerned about the issue of 'seeming to be foolish'
There is confusion among Parliaments who feel that their head should be changed to MWPs (Menmber of the Welsh Parliament).
It has been because of the proposal that the convention name has been changed to the Wales Parliament.
Parliament of various political parties are concerned that this might lead to ridicule.
One member of the Labour Parliament said that his party was concerned that it would sound like Twp and Pwp.
To the foreign reader of Wales: Welsh tup means the first and pwp means the numeral.
One member of the Plaid's Parliament said that the whole group was "not happy" and made other methods.
One of the Welsh Conservatives said his team was "opening other ideas" at the change of the name, but he realized that it was a short term from MWP to Muppet.
In this way the Welsh is also referred to by the pronunciation of the sign in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is still making laws to establish the name, said: "The final decision in choosing the name of the House of Commons is something to consider with those members."
The Welsh edict of 2017 authorized the Welsh Parliament to make a name change.
In June, the Commission published the results of public research, where it has been found that people agree to the idea of changing the name of the building into the Welsh Parliament.
As for the head of the House of Commons, the Commission favored the name Welsh Parliament Meners or WMPs, but the MWP’s opinion had received greater determination in conversation with the public.
AMs seems to make some decisions, but the struggle to reach unity can be a major problem for Leader, Elin Jones, who is expected to issue an unconvincing law about the change within a few weeks.
The policy of this transition also includes other changes in the operation of a legal building, including legislation on the House of Commons and the development of a committee.
The counsel of the House of Commons will receive the final vote on the question of what the building will be called after the legal discussion.
Macedonians are traveling to change the world’s name
People will vote on Sunday in order to change the name of their country to be " Republic of North Macedonia."
A popular opinion was set up to deal with a long - standing conflict with neighboring Greece, with its territory of Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting that the name of its northern neighbors rejects the significance of the region and has repeatedly refused to respond to an invitation to enter the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an antithesisist, said that he would not vote.
However, those who want a name to be changed, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that a change of the name is a price paid to the EU and NATO
St. Martin’s St.
“ According to history, the adults to whom I spoke said there was a place where alcohol and the church were everywhere, ” said Mr. Adams.
"Now, no."
He also said that the absence of alcoholic beverages would be normal.
‘ Various social networks ’ today, he said.
"A drink is not a restaurant where people have frequent access to it."
Concerning the congregations, they worry that the sale of goods will not be as long as the leaders hope, "and soon they will return to where they began."
The churches, he said, could be replaced by tall houses filled with people who could not support the nearby holy sites.
"Most of the people who will buy houses built in these houses are white," he said, "and why they make it fast on the day when these congregations will be closed together because there is no doubt that the majority who move will be members of these churches."
Both were founded by the Western congregation in Harlem before it became the eastern Metropolitan Community in 1870 and ten years later by St.
The first European Methodist congregation had departed in the 1930 ’ s.
A congregation of black people who were religious nearby seized the house.
St. Martin's was picked up by a black congregation under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the flow of sales on 125th Street, a major creditway at Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The fire that had been left in 1939 had been badly damaged, but when Mrs. Johnson’s followers planned to rebuild the house, they set up a number of bears.
Shepherd David Johnson, the son of Dad Johnson is also the next to St. Martin's, he proudly called the established bells "the laps of the poor men."
A specialist who made the flowers in July named something else: "Limitable Wealth" and "the constant remains of history."
Scholar Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that this was the first football in the world by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who had moved to the Riveside Church 18 years ago.
A Merweather and St. Martin's did not replace them.
What has happened in St. Martin’s in recent months has become a matter of concern to architects and engineers, some of whom are brought along by the general leaders of the congregation, others by the Episcopal degree.
A regular parish commission called the parish council, made up of private leaders - who wrote to the council in July concerned that the council "needs regular services to pay money for use, although the churchgoers have always played no part in sending out the architects and engineers whom the owner sent to work.
Some who attend regularly complain that the grief is not openly apparent.
Shaki injured a 13 - year - old child working as a swimmer in California
Shaki was attacked and injured a 13 - year - old boy on Saturday who was performing in Callinonia on the first day of swimming, the authorities said.
The plot took place before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in the Eunices.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that she was performing swimming with her friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when she heard the boy cry for help and went up with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that he thought at first I was always catching a turtle, but then he was, in effect, shouting, ‘ I’m bitten!
I was injured!'
The whole page was set up, "Hammel said he had recognized this as soon as he arrived with the boy.
"I cried everyone to get out of the water: 'In the water there is a shark!' Hammel added.
The young man was taken by plane to the Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was submitted to the most patients.
The type of shark that damaged her remains unknown.
The Captains of Captt. Larry Giles said that at a press conference she had been seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was proved that she was not of harmful nations.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured on the land.
The authorities were closed to reach the people at the beach from Ponto Beach in Casabladed to Swami of Cusunitas for 48 hours to investigate and develop local security measures.
Giles says there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but many are not looking dangerous.
Sainsbury's wish to set up an acronym at the UK
Sainbury's competition with other salesmen such as Boots, Superrung and Debenhams who have stores with sections and beautiful shelves that have other assistants.
As a UK export section of a UK $2,8bn, which is continuing to grow when the fashion market and household goods goes back, an attractive supermarket with offer of holes was tested in 11 stores throughout the country and takes them to other stores in the next year if they are going to be successful.
The idea of getting into the fashion industry has come about because Sopamakes are looking for devices that are used on TV, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's is more than double the size of the decorations which will be given up to 3,000, including in a nation such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawaw for the first time.
Sales from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find many places with similar symptoms available in stores like Boots.
This supermarket also produces a cosmetic - selling Shopu so that more things will be associated with people who don’t eat the products that young buyers desperately need.
Additionally, the Fragrance Shop producer will try to sell in two Sainbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, the second week and the second in the Holy Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
Buying on the Internet and changing the way to buy small food every day in nearby stores means that the stores must do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, the principal at Sainbury's, says that the stores will appear to have sections in the area while the section has many branches to try to deal with the Aldi market that reduces prices and Lidl, which provides more than food.
Sainsbury's has been placing the Argos shop in hundreds of stores and establishing a number of private residences from the time it bought two branches over the past two years, which is said to have strengthened the sale of stores and made the market more profitable.
The shop’s recent attempts to repair its jewelry and medicines failed.
Sainsbury's attempted to join the Boots in the early years of 2000, the founders who established this union after a misunderstanding where they could be distributed money from the drug stores in her large supermarkets.
The new procedure came after Sainsbury sold his 281 drug - dealing business at Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy’s drugstore, for $125, three years ago.
He also said that Lloyd should take part in this work, adding many types of skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business managers at Sainbury, said: "We have changed the appearance and hearing of our beautiful holes in order to adorn the shopping center.
We have also spent a lot of money on well - trained friends who will be available to help with the project.
Our products are designed to meet every need and place of beauty and ease until it means that we are now an interesting place that disagrees with the old method of shopping."
Peter Jones was angry at the departure of Holly Willoughby in a multimillion - dollar contract
An expert at Dragons Den Peter Jones was left angry, because it is due to the release of TV player Holly Willoughby for a financial partnership £11 million of her kind of high - quality business to manage her new partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV

The business was compared with the Gwyneth Patrow of Goop and was encouraged to acquire £11 million Wiloughby’s wealth.
When 37 - year - old Willoughby went to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to his other vacation home.
The source said: "Truly was very important to Holly’s priorities.
This was a long-term future that would allow him to be employed for decades to come.
His out - of - date attitude left everyone involved in a state of shock.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, just about to be confirmed.
There is a storagehouse that is ready to be sold at the Marlow HQ.
Experts believe that the exegessor of This Morning, a member of Britain’s most reliable art group, could spend millions of dollars on the huge expenditures, such as stamps and homemade clothing, as well as the delay in starting businesses.
And it can mean the loss of a long - term friendship.

"We love each other"
She laughed at the criticism she would receive from the press for making comments that she might consider "no leadership" and be sure of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make such a great sacrifice?
Trump spoke in the words of his mocking "readers.
"I didn't give anything."
She also said that Kim wanted to attend the second meeting after her first convention in Singapore in June that Trump said it was a major nuclear campaign in North Korea.
But discussions on the prevention of nuclear weapons have been suspended.
For more than three months after the June conference in Singapore, the general general of North Korea R Yong Ho told the world leaders in the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has seen "alike actions" from the U.S. in terms of what North Korea had done earlier to launch weapons.
Instead, the U.S. continues to offer forced punishment.
Trump expressed great hope in what he said at the convention.
‘ We’re doing well with North Korea, ’ he said.
"We were going to war in North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
We have a wonderful relationship now.
He also pointed out that their efforts to establish a good relationship with Kim have produced good results — including the testing of rockets, resulting in release of prison and restoring U.S. soldiers.
And he justified his strange way when talking about relationship with Kim.
"I'm easy to be the president, but instead of the 10,000 people outside who are trying to enter the stadium, we have about 200 standing here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd standing before him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia — An Island of Death
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, nongovernmental foreign organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had been affected, no world disaster was declared, which is needed as worldwide help.
"In most cases, unfortunately, she seems not asking for help from other countries, so I have a little difficulty," said Sister Sumung.
When the Save the Children makes a team to move to Pola, it is not known whether these foreign workers are allowed to work.
Mr. Sutopo, who speaks for disaster management, says that Indonesian authorities are checking the situation in Pola to see if international agencies are permitted to provide relief.
Despite many earthquakes that occur in Indonesia, the country is not prepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunamis have been built in Aceh, these are unique on some beaches.
The lack of a messenger warning about a tsunami in Pola, though warning had already been delayed, would certainly have contributed to the loss of life.
In times of drought, traveling between many Indonesian islands is very difficult.
Natural disasters make transportation even more difficult.
A medical boat that was laid at Lombok to cure victims of the earthquake is heading for Palla, but it takes at least three days to reach the point of the new disaster.
President Joko Windodo encouraged planning construction in Indonesia to be needed for an election campaign, and he has contributed large sums of money on the streets and on the railways
But a lack of funds affects the government of A Joko, and he is to be selected next year.
Yoko also suffers from religious conflicts in Indonesia, where many Muslims have chosen to form one religion.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have left their homes while Christian and Muslim terrorists fight on the streets, using saws, knives and arrows, and other useless weapons.

Cromwell project in Parliament is the last reminder struck by ‘ trying to reverse history'
Its ban will be a poetic expression because of its devastating destruction, such as Tabban on much of England’s moral and religious practices by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society explained the views of Mr. Crick as "foolishness" and“ attempts to reverse history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was in this dispute on the removal of the images so that the matter of the Oliver Cromwell was not discussed outside the City of Westminster.
It is not possible for Cromwell to carry a picture of the civil war in England.
This erroneous Cromwell might have been offered as a sacrifice because of what Thomas ’ grandmother had done a century ago.
The beautiful Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thornycroft is a testimony to 19th - century ideas and yet another portion of the history of a man who most believe I should still be celebrated.
A Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps particularly at the end of the 19th century more than today, as a defender of legal freedom against outside pressure, in the case of the emperor.
No matter how vividly I show it, the history of this controversy goes on.
The fact is that in the middle of the 17th century, our civilization has changed, and Cromwell is a well - known figure who marks one of the parts.
What he did as Lord of Protection is also to celebrate and remember.
A Chinese farmer was strangled and killed by pigs
One farmer was bitten and killed by pigs at a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, named after his family name "Yuan," was found dead from a broken vein, filled with blood near the market at Liupanshui in Guizhou, South China Morning Post said Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to slaughter a mosquito vaccine at a pighouse on May 30, 2005 in Xing in the province of Qinghai, China.
She was told that she had traveled with her cousin from the area next to Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
In the morning her cousin found her dead, and she found the door of the nearby pig door open.
It was said that in the swine's house there was a great pig with blood on his mouth.
Legal studies confirmed that a 550 - pound (150 kg) pig killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were blood and curved," a leg, named "Wu," he said, as explained in Guitating Evening News.
The security images showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 early Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
An hour or so passed.
The fish that killed the man was not of Yuan or his cousin.
The store manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed was protected so that each member of the family, while the police gathered the evidence at the site.
Yuan’s family and business officials are said to pay for his death.
Although relatively rare, reports of disease - causing pigs are available.
In 2016, pigs hurt their mother and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving him in serious injury.
Ten years earlier, a 650-inch pig had caught a Welsh farmer on his tractor until his wife threatened the pig.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten with her pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that the pig is not aggressive but the flavor of blood can be like "the cause."
"It's just a game.
They are like children who are curious about you. They don't want to hurt you.
You should respect them, ‘ they did. ’
The remainder of a hurricane called Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the US
As foretold, a storm called Rosa is weakened by drifting along the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa is bringing rains to north - north Mexico and southwest U.S.
Rosa had a wind of 85 mph, A Col 1 storms, beginning at five o'clock on Sunday, and was 22 miles 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a small tropical area is being set up in the Pacific Ocean and moved east to the West Coast, U.S.A., while Rosa is approaching Baja California Monday Island, where storms begin to take over the cold north of the U.S.
Rosa will bring as many as 10 drops of rain in some places of Mexico Monday.
Afterward, the warm warmness associated with the cold wind can bring heavy rain to the southwest in the coming days.
In the region, 1 to 4 falls can cause flooding, transporting waste and erosion in the wilderness.
A thick layer of dew causes the rainfall to reach from 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit per hour, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rain is expected to fall in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Flooding can result from worsening conditions as rain falls in the tropics.
It would be dangerous to travel in the wilderness because of the threat of tropical rain.
Strong rain can turn rivers into mighty rivers with strong currents, and torrential rains bring in storms as well as dust.
The approaching cyclone will bring heavy rainfall to the coastal regions of Southern California.
More than half the honey can fall, which can cause small dirt and narrow roads
This is the first rain in the region during its rainy season.
The hot rain of the tropics begins approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains spread like Mondays and Tuesdays.
Heavy rain will flow on the Fourth Four Corners and finally on Wednesday.
The entire US area where the Arctic begins to warm up, October can still be warm.
This sometimes results in quite a change in temperature just a few miles away.
There is a fine example of the hot variety of temperatures in various parts of the US Sunday.
There is an almost 20 - degree distinction between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the following few days, tropical heat is also trying to increase.
Most places in Central and eastern US are expected to see from October and to spread 50 degrees from the Southern Hemisphere to the other parts of the Northern Hemisphere.
New York City can reach up to 50 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C] on Tuesday, which may be about 10 degrees Fahrenheit [10 ° C] above the typical city.
Our long - term predictions show the greater possibility of a high temperature in eastern U.S. during the first half of the month of October.
Over 20 million people have seen interviews in the case of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people saw the six sets of television Brett Kavanaugh, elected at the Supreme Court, give evidence of her fourth and Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses her of the sexual abuse that was alleged in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political struggle continues, and the media are disrupting the regular program of the final Friday session: an article prepared by Sen Arizona Flake for the FBI to investigate the case for one week.
Ford told the Senate of Senate that he was convinced by 100 percent that Kavanaugh had got drunk and tried to get his clothes off the high school party.
Kavanough, in a kind testimony, said he had 100 percent guarantee that this had not happened.
It seems that more than 20 million people like Nielsen prophesied Friday.
The company was counting on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Other numbers were not present at the other satellites that demonstrated the program, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen often has difficulty finding a number of people who watch in offices.
To understand this clearly, the audience’s appearance is like that of a football match or the graduation of the graduation program.
Fox News Chanel, with its TV speaker in full agreement with the election of Kaavaughled, was more than an average of 5,69 million satellites and viewers throughout the entire day of obedience, Nielssen did.
ABC was second to 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
The thought of ending it all continued to be far - reaching.
Flake was very important in what happened on Friday.
When the central Republican office announced that she was to vote for Kavanough, she was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being shot by opposing parties at the time she was about to ride up to the Justice Council's Assembly.
He had stood his face looking down for a few minutes shyly, on a CNN film producer.
"I’m standing here before you," said one woman.
‘ Do you think he is right in the world?
She was told, "You have power and many women have no power."
Flake said that the office had given a notice and said that before a stop, he would have much to say at a committee meeting.
The Internet and television issues were addressed immediately in the following hours, while the members of the Sanhedrin had to vote to accept the Democratic election of the whole Senate to vote
However, Flake said that she would do this if she fully understood what the FBI had produced in the case of the choice mentioned the choice the following week, which few Democrats encouraged.
Flake agreed to them for a little while by talking with her partner, Democrat Sen. Chris Coons.
After discussions with Coons and several seconds, Flake made her choice.
Flake’s election was strong, for it was evident that the Republicans could not vote in Kavanough without investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the cases involving Kavanaugh.

The police fight against Catalans before the day of the election
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday to pursue a confrontation between the guerrilla police and their freedoms, and when thousands of people joined the dispute at the feast of the Catolone election.
A group of anti-submarine anti-submarine anti-probleble police mobs threw them with eggs and sprayed them with powder paint, creating black and dusty clouds in the streets which are usually populated with visitors.
Violence again broke out with the police, using their staff to end the war.
For several hours the self - proclaimed independent groups sang, "Noisiva, no forgiveness has ever been met by those who oppose the union shouting, "Be alive in Spain."
Fourteen persons had received medical treatment for minor injuries that had been damaged during the riot, local journalists said.
The threat to safety remains in the self - confident area one year after the election of October 1 which was considered unacceptable by Madrid but was celebrated by the Catalan - independent group.
The fathers were very determined to be independent, even those who are opposed to independence do not come mainly not vote.
According to the officials of Catalan, about 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the election in the election area and start riots.
The self - appointed groups had built camps and spent the rest of the night on Friday to discourage opposers from resorting to violence to the secular police.
The exhibition had continued but had been forced to be achieved in another way.
Cartarian and his wife, 68 - year - old Vermes, said that they no longer believed that Catalonia would gain freedom.
"Last year we lived in a very pleasant time.
I saw my parents cry happy to be able to vote, but now we are back again," she said.
Although they did well if they won a little more in the elections of the province of December, the independent groups in Catalan have been fighting to begin their work this year with their well - known leaders in solitary prisons or in prison waiting to be judged for the adoption of the choice and declaration of their rights.
Joan Puig, 42 - year - old mechanics who recorded these demonstrations with police on their telephone, said that the conflict was with politicians on all sides.
"It’s too dangerous," he said.
On Saturday, Orol Jukkeras, one of the nine Catalonians who were incarcerated before the end of the past year, announced that they would participate in the decisions of members of the Parliament in Europe the following year.
"To be a vote in European elections is one of the best ways to reinforce a fight against democracy and to suppress others what we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men imprisoned after renting homes and cars
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been built repeatedly in a Londonderry building.
This was done at the Balllynagard Crescent Thursday, about 19: 30 BST.
Det Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage had occurred on the doors and the house.
Sugarcane can also be driven at other times.
The Menga institution defeated the Ragers and the 0 prisoners against Livingstone.
The first chain of Dolly Menga had made Livingstone’s team successful.
The Rovingston movement surprised the Rangers team and won Steven Gerard a second in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox national club.
Dolly Menga had made the Gary Holt team similar to the Irish team in the second section.
Gerard’s team continues to excel in the so - called Premier League sport, and the coming Sunday comes to meet the Herats ’ largest team, which is also followed by eight bells.
Before this event, the Ringers will play with Rapid Vienna in the Fourth European League.
Livingston, in fact, adds the game that has won the team to six games, and the head head of the Holt has not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
The Livingston team loses opportunity against visitors
The Holt group must have been ahead of the point before breaking the yoke, with their alteration of the ball that leads to trouble on the Rangers team.
Scott Robinson had a chance but failed to stop in front of the gate, and then Alan Lithgow tried just as he was walking to meet Craig Halket’s head soccer near the gate.
The contestants were content to let the Ringers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble with the film.
This is how the most important yoke became possible.
The Rangers team did the wrong and started the film and the Livingston team got a chance, when Declan Gallagher and Robinson gave a ball to each other and found Menga, who had touched the ball between the box and found the chain.
At the same time, Rangers’s team kept the ball in its place, but it was found that supporters of the team were not easy to get into it and that the yoke Liam Kelly did not become trouble free.
This went on the second stage, even though Alfredo Morelos had shown a man at the foot of Kelly’s soccer game.
Scott Pittman’s football was enclosed by the foot of the rope team of the Ringer Allan McGregor and Lithgow failed to find a yoke on Livingstone's team’s film.
The cross-shaped balls regularly enter the Livingston box and are continually removed, while the two paints of the paint were rejected — after the errors of Halkett’s replacement of Glenn Middleton, and another fault concerning raping.
Stranger's from Livingston team - according to one observer
Alaska Lamont of BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
Wholesome play is a surprising result of Livingston’s team.
To me, he has played a great deal, much better than we could ever have hoped for such a progress.
He has not changed his performances and players since the time he won the best of all the team, but a great respect must go to the Holts in the way he has helped the team since he arrived.
He had a number of talented athletes.
The director of the Halkett was a very useful tool in this sport, encouraging well - organized balances, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall busy.
The Rangers team was not encouraged, however.
At times, he lacked the good grades he had had at his disposal.
Their final sport was not as good as the opportunity to try to stop the club at the door - and to start the Rangers team, which is at the center of the history of conflict.
Eldogan is received in various ways in Cologne
There was a smile and excitement on Saturday (September 29) that leaders of Turkey and Germany met at a breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s visit to Germany, with a view to improving the relations of the members of NATO.
They argued about human rights, the freedom of the press, and the entry of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open up the new cabinet.
It is home to a large population of Turkish immigrants.
The police offered reasons for the protection of a crowd of 25,000 assembled in front of the stadium, but many followers came closer to see their president.
Hundreds of Eldogan - many of their Kurdians also made their remarks clear, condemning Eldogan’s views as well as the German policy of accepting him into the country.
The exhibition of two sections is reflecting the division of the opinions of the people regarding a stranger, as some of the Turks view him as a hero and a tyrant who has been a tyrant over others.

In June it was reported that the general of the prison had received medical treatment after being arrested by a prisoner.
And in October last year the leaders of violence were called to prison to deal with the greatest turmoil while their colleagues were being tortured by fines.
Hurricane Rosa threatened to destroy Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and the Flood.
It is unlikely that Hurricane Arizona will strike Arizona, but it must occur first on the morning week when the remainder of Rosa's hurricane forces will cross the West Desert, and pose a threat to flooding water.
International Weather Officers already issued ahead will observe the dangers of flooding Monday and Tuesday in southwestern Arizona and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.

Some areas of the Western Desert, including the center of the Rockies and the Great Basin, may be 1 to 2 crates, with the possibility of falling in various areas of up to 4.
For those who are not at the risk of flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing in this area of drought.
Even though flooding is a major problem, some rain may be beneficial as drought approaches the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona’s areas are experiencing severe drought, the second largest, the "weather.com said so.
First, Hurricane Rosa would cause a fall in the Baja California area of Mexico.

A Trump said that Kavanough had experienced, atrocities, anger in the Democratic Republic
The "Cabaugh Judge's vote is a protest against the cruel and dangerous actions of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a conference in Wheeling, West Virginia.
The Trump said that Kavanough had been exposed to the violence, anger, and anger of the Democratic Party throughout its chosen time.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress IV, who strongly and harshly denied the charges against Christine Blesey Ford that she had been raped some decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified to his claims.
On Saturday the president said that the ‘ American people had seen the art and courage ’ of Kavanaugh that day.
"Vavaut guaranteeing Justice Kavanough is a vote of one of the best legal decisions of our time, a judge with a reputation for helping people," told a group of his followers in West Virginia.
The president had mentioned the election of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the need for a good breakthrough for those who follow the Republican Party on the middle elections.
It is five weeks before one of the most important choices of our time will take place.
I’m not running, but I’m running too fast," she said.

Hundreds of people have been killed by earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, with increasing numbers
More than 384 people were killed, many of whom were caught in the waves fell on the shore, when a huge earthquake and tsunami occurred on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a feast on the beach in the city of Black Sea where waves, up to 20 feet [6 m] high, had broken the coastline in the evening and washed many to death and destroyed everything in its path.
The Tsunami was occurring after a powerful earthquake 7.5.
"When the tsunami began yesterday, people were still working on land and did not run away immediately, and they were affected," Sutopo PyyaNigroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster relief organizations in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami did not come alone, pulling cars, chains, houses, and carrying everything out," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at the speeds of 800 kph (47 mph) before reaching the shore.
Some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, they said.
About 16,700 people were moved to 24 locations in Pola.
Space - based photos produced by the Disaster Council showed many homes and shops after the destruction, broken bridges and damaged by water - surrounded buckets.
Earthquakes continued to shake out the coastal city on Saturday.
A few earthquakes were heard in the area 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Administration of Technology (BPPT) also said that the power generated by a major earthquake on Friday was more than 200 of the atom bomb that struck Hiroshima in World War II.
The city’s location at the end of a long, narrow harbor, and that has contributed to the spreading of the tsunami, said it.
Nogroho described the destruction as “great ” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, markets, and hotels fell.
The bodies of the victims were found hidden under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 are not known where they were.
Nogroho said that the injuries and damage could be greater along the coast of 300 miles [300 km] (190 m) to the north of Palu, the region of Donila, which is close to where the earthquake occurred.
The communication systems "have been deeply affected, and there has been little or nothing to do with the nature of things" from Donilaa, Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 residents there, ” said the Red Cross, adding that the volunteers and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This has a problem already, but it can grow," it said.
On Saturday the council was severely criticized for not knowing that a tsunami had occurred in Palu, although officials said that the tide had come at the time of the warning.
In an uncertain video shared on social media, Dad can hear on the roof of the house shouting warning on the sidewalks that the tsunami is approaching.
Within a few minutes, the water wall fell down on the shore, taking with me homes and cars.
Reuters could not prove the video at that time.
The earthquake and tsunami had caused widespread electricity to disrupt the communication process, making it difficult for governments to coordinate rescue operations.
Soldiers have been sending cargo and deliveries from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities, but the survivors still need food and other necessities.
The city’s official record had been opened to further relief activities and would be closed up until Oct.
President Joko Windodo has to go to the rescue area on Sunday.
The number of Alpha and Tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
I’m very scared.
As the workers from the World Vision successfully traveled to the city of Palu, where workers were living in wooden bags built on the grounds of their office, they reached the damaged areas on their way, says Mr. Dosaba.
She told me that she had seen so many damaged homes," she said.
I’m scared.
Even relief agencies had begun to prepare to provide relief, some complained that foreign aid workers with deep experience were being prevented from going to Palla.
According to Indonesia’s laws, money, contributions, and foreign workers simply begin to travel only when a disaster is said to be global.
This has not been without reason.
"It’s still a disaster," said Aulia Ariani, Prophet of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"As soon as the government says, "AWINO"., with the disaster of the world, we can ask for help from other countries, but there is no such knowledge now available."
On the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami, friends and relatives of the lost loved ones hoped to return as miracles that had never occurred in the history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was carried from the toilet.
On Sunday, the rescuers rescued a woman who had been confined to the trash for two days before her mother’s body was nearby.
Gendon Subandono, a teacher of Indonesia’s national team at a parachute, had trained two of the missing athletes at an Asian game, which had been completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those imprisoned at Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mrs. Mambagi.
‘ Like a big player flying with a parachute, I have my anxiety, ’ he said.
Gendon also pointed out how, a few hours after the news of the Raa Roa Hotel spread to a group of parachutists, he tried to send the WhastAPp messages to the Palu players, who take part in a feast on the beach.
Its messages, however, produced only one white symbol, instead of two blue signals.
I think it means that the messages didn’t come," she said.
Thieves steal $26,750 at a time when a car will drop money into a restaurant and the reception of Newport tourists
On Friday morning, according to reports from the Newport Police Department, theft will cost $226,750 during the time the car will leave money in the dining room and the tourist market in Newport.
Drivers leave cash in a theater and plan to leave some extra money, Det. Dennis McCarty wrote in his report.

According to reports of eyewitnesses, they saw several people running away from the scene, but the police did not say how many people they were.
Anyone who has a message on these people should call the Newport police on this number 859-92-3680.
West: The singer has changed his name to Him
The songwriter of Kwane West is changing his name to - Yes.
In addition to the change at Twitter Saturday, she wrote: "He is known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been called Yahweh for a time and has used the name as the title of his eighth seal, which was released in June.
These changes come before they appear on Saturday at the Light River, where they are expected to produce their new granny called Yandi.
It was replaced by the singer Ariana Grande at a presentation that ended "for reasons of conflict," said the producer.
In addition to being a summary of his work name, West said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the word that is used widely in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'nu,' West said in the beginning of this year, when discussing its gray title with Big Boy.
"So I am with you, and I am with you, and you will die.
It came from Kanye, that is, to Him alone, a mere reflection of our well - being, our mistakes, our confusion, all.
The crocodile clearly shows who we are.
It is one of the most popular musicians who change names.
Sean Combs is commonly known as Puff DADdy, P. Didy or Diddy, but this year he has declared his love for loving names such as Love and Brother Love.
A link to the ancient West, the JAY-Z, also declared that his name can be called in a line or without.
PEOPLE in Mexico have vowed not to use an army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a choice leader in Mexico, has vowed that he would not use an army to fight the civilian population toward the end of a 50 - year day high.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlettelco Plaza "No use of war to oppress the Mexicans."
Soldiers shot students at the peacefully liturgies held on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when groups of freedom schools had settled in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico every month to donate money to those who are studying and opening many public institutions free of charge.
He also said that unemployment and lack of education are motivating young people to join a gang.
The U.S. government will increase the cost of man - made machines
While China is growing in human - machine production, the United States is supposed to raise the cost of research in the region, says a commercial and commercial engineer who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Many U.S. branches have been proposed to use this device, while the world has no positive program on AI.
In the meantime, China had started its program last year: and by 2030 it will be held on Number 1 on the use of the term.
"Respecting research can be a good start, considering that all countries are much higher than the U.S., and we have to get jobs that are more advanced, ” said Lee.
The extra money can double the chance for the success of AI in the U.S., Lee told CNBC on this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowes: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" is completed this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, executive of the Sivolation Ventures that has devoted a lot of money to research machines in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, this elder at the University of Carnegie Mellon developed a machine that succeeded in mastering Othello's sports team and then became the head of the Master of Science in Micronesia and the head of the Google branch in China.
Lee was grateful for the establishment of the Defense Advented Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and wanted to know the date when the competition would be again in order to help identify the next scholars.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win public prizes, says Lee.
"It’s not China which takes educated people; but it’s companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other companies have employed university experts to work in the AI sectors in recent years.
Lee says that a change in the standards of migration can also help the U.S.
"I think those who have PhD's degrees should be granted a permit to be a member of the American race.
China had established its program for the development of the Machinery in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China is responsible for the various schools as well as the government commission and other research organizations in the United States, but the Chinese education is limited, says Lee.
In the early year of the U.S. Security Department established the Joint Intelligence Center, which should include coworkers in companies and academics, and White House has announced the establishment of the Secret Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA has announced a $2 billion production system called AI Next.
With NSF, it still costs over $100 million a year to research AI.
When the National Security Commission puts hundreds of millions of marks in part of the production of Human Machines each year.
Macedonians have given a hearing vote if it is necessary to change the country’s name
They cast for their opinions on whether it should be appropriate to change the name of the country for the country, the "Re Republic of North Macedonia" which may lead to the conflict between the world and Greece that has been forcing the country to be recognized as a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in the Macedonian province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbors has so boasted that it has since denied registration to the Macedonians as a member of the NATO and EU.
In June the governments agreed to alter the name of Macedonia, but culturalists have rejected it as an act of disrespect for the culture and history of the great size of the Macedonians.
National President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he does not vote in the elections and that public votes have led to the threat that men can not meet the level of half the country's citizens in order to make the vote acceptable.
The question of the vote was: "Do you want to be members of the NATO and EU in accordance with our relationship with Greece?."
Those who endorse the name as prime minister of Zoran Zaev have demonstrated that it is a difficult thing to do but that it should be allowed to become member of the EU and NATO, also to leave the country into a state of Yugoslavia.
"I came to decide for our country, the future for young Macedonians to live as members of the European Union, because this means that all people will live without fear," says Olivera Georgijvska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although illegal, many law - enforcement agencies have said that they have agreed to cooperate with the decision to make a favorable decision.
The changing of that name will require the approval of two thirds of the council’s counsel.
The National Legislation Council stated that there were no difficulties at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.
However, the votes were 16 percent, compared with 34 percent of the voters of the 2016 legislature for those who were registered to vote.
"I came to vote for my children, both of us and of the Europeans," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old in the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, Zorica, and their son Dushko voted in Macedonia to change the country’s name by means of a change of the name, which would open the way to enter the NATO and European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018
In the Skopje House, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavarkov builds a small tower and forms seats in front of the designated tents and those who will refuse to vote.
"We want to be members of NATO and EU, but we want to join these organizations and think, not through force, says Kavarkov.
"We are poor, but we have honor."
If he does not want us to be a member like the Macedonians, we may be able to register with other organizations such as Russia and China as the Euro-Assian Union.
Zaev, prime minister, said that as a member of the NATO, it would promote trade in Macedonia, which is also a small number of people.
"I believe there is a lot of prejudice because over 80 percent of our citizens like EU and NATO," said Zaev.
She said that the vote "Ya" is "we'll be."
The National Institute for Policy Research indicated that some 30 to 43 percent of the population will participate in a sub-number number of potential arrivals.
One of Telma’s telemarketers showed that about 57 percent of the people to whom the reporter spoke would give the vogue.
Some 70 percent of those polled said that they would vote in agreement to change the country’s name.
These decisions require 50 percent of all voters, including one vote.
The rejection of this idea is the first failure of a European government organization to take over the leadership of the world last May.
See below: The Manchester City competition, Sergio Aguero crossing behind the Brighton team to get a contract
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed after Brigton’s club where Manchester City won 2 to 0 Saturday in the Etihad Stadium stadium in Manchester, England.
The Aguero had done what seemed to be an easy solution in 65 minutes.
The Argentine athletes received a ball in the middle of the stadium for the first time.
He ran with the ball in three lines, and then I had the opportunity.
The Aguero next met four Brighton athletes.
He then raced against one after another and ran faster than the other decks and entered a box box at the Brington team.
Then he handed the ball to Sterling, who was on his left.
The English soccer players broke off the ball once and returned Aguero, whose leg leg fought in a tank to cross Matthew Ryan to the right of the net.
"Aguero suffers from pain on his feet," Pep Guardilla, senior teacher of the Machesster City team said to the press.
"We said he played 55 or 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We had the opportunity to find a yoke at that time."
But it was Sterling that gave the team the opportunity to win the cup.
His yoke came in 29 minutes.
The Aguero received a ball in the Brigton district.
Then he handed out a fine soccer match to Leroy Sanne on the opposite side of the stadium.
Sane pulled the ball a couple of times and handed it to Sterling to her under the direct control of the ball.
Sterling simply pushed the ball into a net just about ahead of the line.
The Manchester City team is playing with the Hoffenheim team of European scholars at the Champions League in the line at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon in the Sinheim stadium, Germany.
Schezer wants to play games with Rockies
When the Nationals team was released from the scene of violence, there was no need to introduce other games.
But Sterzer, who is actively involved in sports, wants to play on God’s Day and the Colorado Rockies team, except in order to have a share in the contest that Rockies are leading up to the Los Angeles Edges team at NL West.
The Rockies team won 5-2 games and the Nationals team on Friday night, but they are still eager to win their first cup.
"Although there is nothing to be found on these games, we will go into the stadium to know that the local people in Denver and the team will give us the most large games I can play this year.
So why don’t I want to play that game?'
The Nationals team did not announce Sunday’s inauguration, but it seems that they were intent on producing Schezer to play the games in the first place.
Schcherzer, who will be playing 34 times before, has made plans at Thursday baseball games and has been playing on Sunday after taking a good rest.
The Washngton player has 18-7 footprints in the 2.53 ERA and has played 300 footballs in two thirds of the ice caps.
Trump conventions in West Virginia
The president had mentioned the election of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the need for a good breakthrough for those who follow the Republican Party on the middle elections.
Everything we do is under threat in November.
It is five weeks before one of the most important choices of our time will take place.
This is one of the mains, the big -- I am not running but am running so fast that I am everywhere to fight the right choice," he said.
Trump continued, "You see the dangerous, frightening mob of Democrats, seeing what is happening right now.
And he is determined to regain power through whatever means are needed, seeing the challenges, these as daunting.
He does not care about those who hurt him, who must cross to get strength and correct him, what he needs and who corrects, and we do not give them."
The Democrats, said, are intent on ‘ get away and stop. ’
"And you have seen this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats“ angry and hostile but not honest."
He also mentioned the name of the director of the Senate Committee of Senate, Dianne Feinstein in the Democtrat, which was received with a term of contempt from the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you release the document?
Ah, how.
No, no, waiting together - that was the most horrible language I’ve ever seen.'
A Labour is no longer a large congregation.
He lets no one say when expressing his feelings
When the promoters of the Momentum in my movement decided to rebuke me, it was not surprising.
Besides, I am the last person among the Labor Pps to be told that we are not welcome all of this because of our having to talk about it.
My partner of Joan Ryan’s legal house was also treated in the same way because he opposed religious opposition.
To me, the trainer blamed me for not cooperating with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the need for reliable economic legislation, in the security of the country, Europe, there are issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Convention in Notingham East Labor Friday is "We want the meetings to be shared and beneficial.
For eight years of my life as the AP for the Labour Party, the Friday evening meetings of the GC were the same.
Sad to say today, it is not so many meetings and the promise of political action in a "good, mild" has already been laid out and this has already happened.
It also seems that differing views are not allowed in the Labor and Emory movement is defined on the date and is accredited to the parity separation.
This started soon after Jeremy became the leader, as friends I thought I might have been involved in politics began to expect me to change and to live in an area I didn't agree with — either in national security or in the EU.
I will always speak freely, and it doesn't mean what I say, but it follows the persecution of the social media which they want me to avoid, to criticize local politics, to tell me not to become a member of the Labor Organization.
And that’s not all.
True, I know that I have a better chance than some of my friends, such as the comments that have been made to me for political reasons.
I admire the abilities and sacrifices of those who face immorality or prejudice every day.
One of the most disturbing developments of our time is the way atrocities are viewed as normal.
The following Sabbath, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labor Organization should follow the tradition of caring for others.
The truth is that we are no longer a larger congregation and that any "dependability" or legal changes are reduced.
I have been a very active partner for the past two years when I have been encouraged to drop my head, become a little talker, and become a ‘ good person. ’
But that was not the reason for my involvement in politics.
Since I had won the Labor Company 32 years ago as a student, when I became angry with the government’s decision to work for the government that left my whole class in a deeply worn - out school, I have tried to promote the good works of the government toward those whom he wished, either as a house manager or as a government official.
I have never hidden my political goals, including the past.
No one in the Nottingham East could be disturbed in any way by my views and issues that I would not agree with this new direction.
For all of them, I would say that as the country enters the Brexit which will harm families, businesses and government activities, I do not understand my purpose to waste time and energy by being loyal to the leader of the Labour party.
But my message is not that of Notingham Momentum, and it is from the region that I have, whether the Labours or not: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise you that there are no threats to the choice or politics that would hinder me from doing what I believe is required to all of you.
Chris Leslie and the P P of the Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr’s unsuccessful team reaches the top
The two ends have changed the results of the games, but it is not surprising that Ayr has to overcome the exciting games of Tennets.
Ayr is at the top, and it is the only team that has never in ten history failed.
In the final analysis, it was the best game of the team after the team’s back, since its players do not take advantage of the many possible moments these were to appeal to the team’s teacher, Peter Murchihe.
"We have had a hard history but have never failed, so I must be happy," she said.
Robyn Christie a Melrose said: "Be respected to the Ayr team, they made better use of their opportunities than we did."
The 14 - minute chance of obtaining Grant Anderson was put to use by Fazier Climo of Ayr’s team, but receiving a yellow document from Roy Hughes of Scotland, caused the Melrose’s party to reduce the bonds through Jason Baggot.
Climo added the Ayr team’s yokes by means of a penote and replaced the first stage before the Ayr team went ahead with 17 to 5.
But the Melrose began a second phase and the opportunity he had won was well used by Baggot, who lost only five bars.
Then the drama came to a standstill from Ruaridh Knott, who was picked up on the jaw, and the return of Ayr added the captives to the program by the Climo, which was stolen by Stafford McDowall.
An associate of the Ayr team, Blair Macpherson also received a yellow document and was released, and Melrose took advantage of the opportunity and tried to lay the yoke on Bruce Colvine to pressure the Ayr team.
The club at the entrance reconvened, and after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow document in his defense of Climo, on the line of the penote, Macperson was given a credit for the Ayr team.
Climo lost his temper, and as it was when Kyle Rowe fought in a box and picked up his fifth team, Gregory Henry.

'sea and our home : Bolivia’s country off the sea awaiting a court’s return to the Pacific
Seafarers have oversight of the main armament of La Paz.
Public buildings advertise the blue flag.
The waters from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the words: "The sea is ours by free will.
It is our duty."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coast where Chile is abandoned in a 20th - century civil war is still well - known — such as the yearning to recover from the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may be even greater for decades now, while Bolivia awaits the judgment of a world court of five years on October 1.
" Bolivia has power, a spirit of unity and peace, and there is great hope and confidence in the outcome," says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's governor.
Most Bolivians will see the ICJ’s decision at the national landmarks, with the hope that the Hague court supports what it says after years of properly discussing Chile would have to negotiate for Bolivia a beach.
Evo Morales, the best - known president of Bolivia, is experiencing the difficult task of reconvening the morning - year - long cycle with high expectations on Monday decision.
"We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some experts believe that the court will not decide to favor Bolivia - and that small changes may be made if it does.
The UN from the Netherlands has no power to offer the Chilean area, and it has said that it does not know the results of the discussions.
That the ICJ decision comes only six months after the final hearings indicated that the case was “not a difficult one, ” said Paz Zárate, a U.S.
In addition to advancing Bolivia’s goal for the past four years, it may have restored the earth.
"The case of going to sea has been taken by the leadings of Bolivia here," said Zárate.
Morales ’ harsh speeches have ruined all the good things left in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to converse, but the discussion will not be easy.
These two countries have not had a succession of independent states since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the notion that these decisions acted with amazing force.
The following Monday will bring to Bolivia "the best opportunity to have a new relationship with Chile" and also the opportunity to“ finish 139 years of conflict and have a meaningful relationship," she said.
Calzadilla also argued that Morales - one of the most prominent presidents of Latin America - used sea talk as a political policy.
" Bolivia will not leave her freedom to go to the Pacific," she added.
"The decision is an opportunity to overcome the past."
North Korea promises that he will not destroy nuclear weapons unless he trusts the US
Foreign Minister North Korea R Long Ho says that their country will not destroy their first nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
This is the comment at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
She asked the United States to keep her promise at a Singapore conference.
His words follow the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompoo appear to be about to resume the three months of nuclear conversation at the Singapore conference with Kim Jonn Un from North Korea.
It is said that it is only “a dream ” that the continuing economic sanctions and the U.S. refusal to announce the end of the Korean war will cause the North to fall.
Washington does not want to make that announcement before Pyonganga destroys weapons.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump are in favor of the second meeting.
But there is no doubt that Pyongangang has been determined to give up the weapons that the country considers to be the only means of security.
Pompeii is preparing to go to Pyongangy the next month to prepare for the second assembly between Kim and Trump.
fashion shows in Paris revealing a few recent hats on the High Street road near you
If you need a variety of avoidance or completely close the sun, do not look anywhere else.
The inventors Valentino and Thom Browne uncovered several SS19 large hats on the road that were interesting and surprising to those who had some fashions in the Paris Facion Week.
Unsupervised hats were sent to the Instagrams last summer and have brought their magnificent creatures along the road.
The clear - cut covers of Valentino were of a great size as decorated with a feather as a feather filled with the heads of the roleholders.
Some of the larger additives, such as the antics, the rare and delicate hat, are not designed to make your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed an unusual array of masks and also during the celebration of Halloween.
Many beautiful masks had been cut into the lips and were much more similar to Hannibal Lecter than the erecture.
One creature resembles floats on water filled with tubes and glasses, while the other looks like a cup of melted ice.
And if you continue to talk about fads and fashions, you have an advantage.
Style managers predict that large bats may be able to travel to the main streets near you.
The large hats are clear with the 'La Bombay' shoes, a two-footed grass cover that has been visible to everyone from Rhanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A religious symbol behind the imaginary cover that had spread on a socialized media sent a huge creature to a beach market made of grass with almost as large swimming equipment.
La La La Riviera S19 in Paris Facsion Week was a very beautiful case of pureness and white skin.
The famous author of Luke Artitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and corvettes arrive on the high road during the summer; as a designer would be very sensitive to the need for large products.'
John Edward: The ability to speak different languages is required of all peoples on earth
The independent schools in Scotland have a reputation for academic achievement, and in 2018 this has resulted in some fine fruits that are encouraged and developed in sports, art, music, and so on.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are endeavoring to provide the best help for children and their parents.
The independent schools endeavor to equip their students to pursue higher education, a trade, and their positions as citizens of the world.
As a educational field capable of establishing and establishing school courses in human terms, we see modern languages continuing as much - needed courses in schools.
Nelson Mandela says: “If you speak to my father in the language he hears from me, it is only his head.
If you speak to him in his language, he may touch his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English to establish a brotherhood and to depend on foreigners.
From the results of recent tests of this year, we can see that languages are learned by many but are far more advanced in independent schools.
About 68 percent of the students who had learned foreign languages did well and received special results from class A.
Most of these, gathered in 74 schools of SCIS, showed that 72 percent of the students had succeeded in achieving the high grades of Mandarin, 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of the Spanish students had also experienced the results of A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland are contributing to the study of foreign languages as a necessary skill that children and youths will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now, as a chosen theme, are being done the same in the way of STEM education (science, arts, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Economic and Skills in 2014 found that because of the difficulty of finding potential employers, 17 percent said there was a lack of people with language skills.
Therefore, the ability to speak in tongues is absolutely necessary to prepare young people for future projects.
Since most of the work opportunities are open to the language field, these skills are needed in the world.
Regardless of a person’s choice, learning a second language will open up the way for that future.
Being able to associate directly with people from a foreign background places places a person of many languages ahead of him.
According to the UK International Office of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent of them do not speak a foreign language in order to communicate well, and it is the only language spoken by a population of 2 percent, of 15 percent.
That is why putting money into the language system is now necessary for modern children.
Having several languages, especially those in the developing world, will contribute to a child’s potential for good work.
In Scotland each school is unique in its own language.
Several schools will focus more on modern languages, while others will teach languages that seem especially useful in the UK in preparation for the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages you can choose in private schools, and teachers who are skilled in these areas.
The Rhythmary Schools in Scottish are devoted to developing methods of learning to prepare the children and give them the skills they may need to succeed, no matter what may happen in the future.
It is still not included in the world's business, so that languages continue to be of importance in the future of the world, why this should be shown in education.
True, modern languages have to be viewed as “a worldwide phenomenon. ”
The independent schools continue to offer elections, supplementary education, and the quality of life of the Scots.
It's only missing a few copies.

The first appearance of LeBron on the Lakes Sunday team in San Diego
The wait is about to end for the pictures to be seen LeBron James starting to play in the Los Angeles Lakes.
Lakes teacher Luke Walton has announced that James should play the first game in preparation for Sunday mornings against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how much time will it take for them to play it?
"More than one and less than 48," says Walton on the Lakers website.
Journalist Lakes Mike Trudell wrote that James may be able to play for a few minutes.
Following the first exercise this week, James was asked what he wanted to do in connection with a series of six night - training exercises for Lakeers.
"I don't want a game ready for this time to be prepared," he said.
Trump convention in West Virginia Virginia City, You Tube Channel
Donald Trump, president of the Royal Society, has been holding meetings that night in Wheeling, West Virginia Virginia.
It is one of the five rulings of Trump for a week, including standing meetings as in the state of Tennessee and Mississippi.
When the decision to prove his appointment as judge in the Supreme Court was lifted, Trump wanted to appeal to the central taxes of his authority while his Republican party was at the risk of being confiscated in the law - enforcement center of November.
What is the occasion, and how can you view it on the Internet?
Thursday evening is 7: 00 p.m., Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Web site www.jw.org provides a wealth of information on the Internet.
Trump must speak on cases of the Brett Kavanoughs who were appointed judges at the Supreme Court, which provoked anger because it relates to the fact that the Kavanoughs are thought to be involved when the vote for him has now been stopped by the FBI on a Sabbath.
The main purpose of the conference, however, is to assist the Republican organization to obtain legal recognition in November.
Thus, the aim of the five Trump conferences is "to encourage our followers and the people who want a good deal when the Republican party wants to protect and increase the number of their authors in the legislature," according to Reuters newspaper reports.
"The presence of so many advisers is the most important thing that the presidents have had to hold these meetings in many places as we go to social gatherings," one of the lead guides to select Trump, who didn't want to be mentioned told Reuters.
The convention at Wesbanco Stadium in the city of Wheeling can invite followers from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be broadcast by the Pittsburgh staff, ” according to the West Virginia Metro newspaper.
Saturday is the second time last month that Trump has gone through the caves of Virginia, the city where he won 40 percent of his votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the representative of the Republican party in West Virginia by Patrick Morrisey, who is still in the control.
"Preparation on the victims and presidents does not provide a good picture for Morrison, ” said Simon Haeder, a leading politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters reports.
2011 Year’s cup of Ryder: The USA team has shown a measure of success in winning its games so that it will still be privileged as Sunday games are approaching.
When three plays are played, the four - person plays on Saturdays can be the most fitting type for the Royal Cyder.
Changes are made in sports, but it is something that players especially believe in athletics like these.
To whom, then, is the privilege now extended?
"They led the 6 points, but now only 4 are, so we do it as a chance," says Jordan Spieth as they walk quietly.
The European team has the opportunity, along with a total of 4 points, when the twelve are left.
The American team, says Spieth, feels that they have much to offer, like the success of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and they all found three fourths of the four points.
Spieth has had a good influence on his personality, and he has set a good example.
As he and Thomas remained in a vortex, it was quite clear how the ball they hit fell into a hole, so that history would be comparable to four points of strength.
His casting of ball into the hole was over the 15th floor, and the sound was also played, which indicates that he believed that the American team had not complied.
"You should just wear hard and think about your sport," said Spieth.
This is what all players have here.
Only 18 months later, the team shows off.
Contestants who win Spieth and Thomas during these two days are Frascesco Milina and Tommy Fleetwood, which are still in the Ryder team.
The two great European athletes have won four fourths, and they cannot make any mistakes.
The "Moliwood" was the only two player who did not play before the club on Saturday afternoon, and on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the end of nine.
This, coupled with the fact that they are an athlete’s best victory over the Church, and no players in Europe can win the European team after the sun sets in the Golf National.
They may even be on different paths.
It is still urgent to say that the European team has taken out the cup, which is still here.
Bubbo Watson and Web Simpson easily conquered Sergio Garcia, who was a team and Alex Noren at four soccer games in the morning.
Getting the ball into a nearby hole and hurling it twice over the first nine lines led their team so that the Spanish and Sweden scholars were unable to return.
But there is no compromise on the Church.
Four football games with four spectators are delightful to watch closely because of the conversation between two team members, the direction given, the direction given, the direction given, and the direction not to be given and the means used to change courses.
In the meantime the European team has been quite successful with the team and is on its way to final competition but these four people have shown that the American team has the highest possible potential, especially for the U.S.A., which is questioned.
The European team will lead 10 - 6 points on the last day of the Ryder Cup
The European team will be privileged to play the final team in the Ryder team after winning the American team in the four weekend football and 10-6-port games.
Two spirit - inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari headed a sports team with the Tigger Woods, their success in playing sports events at the Gulf National stadium led to four.
A European team trained by Thomas Bjorn, wanting to recover a cup that had been denied protection two years earlier at the Hazeltine stadium, packed the American team into a four - morning match, on a 31 - game show.
The U.S. team fought hard on the two - game team, but that did not stop the defeat.
A team trained by Jim Furyk is required to win a cup by eight of a 12 Sunday’s games.
Fleetwood and the first European athletes to compete in the race to win four points, and with their good performance at the end of the week, she and the beloved Molinali are called "Melliwood" and the second two players who win the four four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder.
After a fierce victory over Woods and Patrick Reed in the four soccer games, he also won Woods and Bryson Dechambía’s first team in the U.S. team with 5 and 4 good points.
Woods, who tried to play them on the two weekends, occasionally showed a male, but he still won the 19 games of 29 games with four characters and 7 in a series of seven.
Justin Rose, retired from four early soccer matches, then organized a team of two of Henrik Stenson on four - man team and won 2 and 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka -o.
On a cold day in southeastern Paris, the European team did not pass unnoticed.
Jordan Spieth, who won three victories with Justin Thomas, led the American team with two weekend tickets.
They won 2 and 1 points over Jon-Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four - football team and won the Pulter and Rotry Mcllroy 4 and 3 in a competition of four people even won their first two games.
In the history of Ryder’s cup of coffee, only twice the remaining team of four puppies has won its victory, even though the Furyk security team needs only the strength of the other team to take the cup.
If the second team went well for two days, the top of the Sunday game would seem more difficult.
North Korea said that there is no reason for him to stop using his weapons without having to rely on them
On Saturday a North Korea foreign minister told the United Nations that continued discrimination against the U.S. government, and there was no reason for his nation to give up its use of nuclear weapons during that period.
RI Yong Ho said at the annual Council of North Korea that the country had done the "recruit" last year, as it was to stop testing their nuclear weapons and bombs, destroying the nuclear plant and promising no more their nuclear weapons.
"But we didn't see America doing the same things again," he said.
"If we don't trust America we will not be satisfied with the security of our country, and in these things it’s impossible for us to stop using nuclear weapons alone."
Even the Ri of North Korea's complaint regarding the refusal to quit the nuclear use of the United States where North Korea was to be praised for its major role in the matter, his words were effective because his country had not only refused to quit using nuclear weapons as Pyongyang did before.
He mentioned Kim Jong Un and Trump’s first president of North America and North Korea on June 12, when Kim promised to try ‘ stop using nuclear weapons on the Korean island, ’ and the Trumps emphasized safety in North korea.
North Korea has hoped to end the war between North Korea and South Korea, but North Korea has declared that North Korea has lost its use of nuclear weapons.
The United States has repeatedly refused to curb the harsher sentence of North Korea.
"The United States is struggling "for the first time to stop using nuclear weapons" and has been adding ways of preventing North Korea to restrict North Korea, and America has also refused to“ announce war, ” says Ri.
“ The idea that punishment will influence us is simply not good enough.
But the problem is that living on this list often leads to a lack of satisfaction.
Ri does not mention Kim’s second successor, Trump, who was president of the United Nations at the start of this week.
Rather, the minister spoke of the former state of Kim and the South Korea president of Maon Jae and added: "If it were not for us to stop using nuclear weapons in South Korea, it would not be a case of leaving these weapons on the Korean island."
Even so, Ri's language was different from that of the previous year when he was speaking to another U.N. when he told them that it was easy to direct the areas of the Americas with the weapons of North Korea when the "Wicked President" Trump called Kim "expert" to an inferior place.
This year at the United Nations conference, the Trumps, who feared that ‘ permanently destroyed ’ North Korea, praised Kim in the first act of nuclear disarmament, but said that a great deal of work had to be done and that North Korea’s sentences were still to be used after the war in North Korea.
On the third day, Trump said he had not set a limit of time, and he said, "It takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia requested the UN Security Committee to honor North Korea for its procedures.
However, U.S. President Mike Pomeo told the Fourth Security Committee: "The rulings from the North Korean Security Committee were to continue and we will probably be able to see that the country has stopped using them."
Since 2006, the Committee has been extending the protection of North Korea to protect North Korea's national currency from nuclear and other nuclear weapons development programs.
Pompeii met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and said that he would be on his way to North Korea the following month in order to straighten out the two provinces of Trump and Kim.
Pompeii has been traveling to Norht Korea three times this year, but the final leg of the journey did not work out.
They left North Korea to say that the discussions were successful, but a few hours later, North Korea argued with him that he gave the "criminal."
North Korea has promised to meet the Moon this month to destroy the nuclear plant and the arsenal if the United States can do the same.
Kim said she had told them that ‘ these same things ’ are the security security that Trump promised in Singapore and how to make a relationship with the United States.
Harvard university students are learning a valuable lesson in getting enough sleep
The new study at Harvard University that started this year has caused college students to get sufficient sleep in order to end all night readings using sleep therapy.
One researcher found that the students in high school worldwide do not know what to take care of themselves.
Dr. Charles Czeisler, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and expert on Brigham and Mother, prepared the subject in what he believed to be the first place in American history.
He encouraged them to start the study after teaching about the possible consequences of fasting.
'After I finished school one girl found me and told me: 'Why is this to me in my last year'?'
She said that no one told her the importance of sleep - what surprised me, 'He told the Telegraph.
This year’s course of study explains students what proper sleep is all about, as well as how to contribute to the quality of their life.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Head of the Center for Health, says that the university decided to start the study after finding that many students do not sleep particularly during the week.
Over the course of an hour, there are several lines of reasoning.
In one area there is a picture of the living room, where students wear a cup of coffee, matani, teachers, and books to be informed of the dangers of sleep and light, and how good performance on games is affected by lack of sleep, and the need for sleep.
On the other hand, students are told that the way sleep deprivation often puts people at risk for heart disease, depression, and cancer.
The school’s curriculum is designed to encourage the students to consider their day - to - day activities.
We know that it does not change the behavior of the students here.
However, it is believed that they have the right to know - as in which you have the right to know the dangers of smoking, said Professor Czeisler.
He added that new skills and communication of students and education contribute to sleepiness throughout the night.
To make sure that you are getting enough sleep, and a good way to be a ‘ secret weapon ’ for students to deal with discouragement, fatigue, and anxiety, he said, but he should also avoid obesity, since lack of sleep makes the brain constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19- year- old technical student in California, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the study because he learned one of the lessons taught by this professor in his first year at Harvard University.
She said that the study had opened her eyes and encouraged her to encourage the teacher to reach out to everyone in the university.
As a result, he requires all students of high grades to receive further education, such as these before the university.
Professor Czeisler asked the students to set aside time for their watch to remind them of when to sleep, when to get up, and to understand the dangers of light coming from the telephone, the use of a telescope, and the use of electric light that is causing sleep apnea.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga’s Mine led to Gerard’s surrender
The Rangers team also succumbed to the movement when Dolly Menga led the Gerard team, which appeared to be in the wrong direction, to surrender to 1-0 in front of the Livingston team.
The Ibrox team appears to have been the first footing from February when it won 41 chains before the St.
Menga had lost seven minutes in the first section, and the Rangers team that is missing is not visible to the point that it was able to return.
When the Rangers team falls on its six - story list, Livingston’s team has risen to a third and is just behind Hibernian.
And there may be other problems that could happen to the Rangers team when the assistant of the Clum Spece was helped by the hospital-serving staff because of injuries in the head under a substance thought to have been dropped from the latter part.
Gerard turned eight athletes who defeated Ayr’s team to reach the rank as the statues of Betfred.
When Holt did not change the athletes who played with the Heart team a week, he must have been happy that his team played the Rangers team.
The Ragers ’ team kept the ball, while Livingston’s team formed the decomposition of the ball game.
And they had to lose it in the first two minutes when Menga gave Scott Pittman a good ball to blow on the stadium where Allan McGregor was in the middle, but the players fought at the side of the game.
A soccer match from Keghan Jacobs found Craig Halket but Alan Lithgow, a boxer with Craig Halket, fought back.
The Rangers team displayed a male role but seemed to have only an initial feeling of optimism but of low self - confidence as they arrived at their destination.
Alfredo Morelos feels that he should be given a 10 - minute ticket when he met Steven Lawles but the performers, and Thomson forbade the Colombian.
The Rangers team was able to fight only two times but the old Rangers team team, Liam Kelly, did not suffer from soccer from Lasna Colibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
When the bond that Livingston’s team discovered at 34 minutes was contrary to the movements of the games, no one would deny that the team was supposed to find the limit.
The Rangers team was also unable to remove the ball from Jacobs film.
Scott Arfield did not stop the ball when Declan Gallagher presented the ball to Scott Robinson, who played quietly and gave him Menga who easily lost it.
Gerard showed his dissatisfaction with the Rangers team when he pulled out the Colibaly and introduced Ryan Kent, and the change in their ability to produce good fruit soon when the athletes in the area gave her Morelos, but Kelly, who played high games, ran to clear the ball.
On the other hand, Livingston’s team pressured the Rangers team to play their favorite soccer team, and Lithgow and Halkett simply pull out long - distance soccer.
The Holt’s team could have added their yokes to the end of the game, but McGregor protected Jacobs, Lithgow, before hitting the ball beside his head.
The Rocket Ragers, Glenn Middleton’s ex - backed out of the room, sounded a note in protest with Jacobs, but Thomson, also rejected the proposal.
Almanac: Builder of the Geiger Center
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and BETWE ... the day future scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a system of knowledge and tested the atom - produced energy, which eventually became the Geiger Centre.
If the main tool of science since then, the Geiger Center has become a well - known weapon, such as in the 1950 movie “Bells of Coronado, ” as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans look like unreliable scientists:
Brother: What's that?'
Rogers: "It is the Geiger Counter, used to find electrical salts, such as uranium.
If you have doubts about these headphones, you will be able to hear the effects of the energy generated by atomic forces."
Evans: "Yes, that's amazing!."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before she was 63 years old.
But its products are still there.
A new vaccine for cancer can help the body’s immune system to ‘ detect danger cells. ’
The new vaccine for cancer can help the immune system to ‘ recognize and kill dangerous cells. ’
A vaccine has helped the immune system to detect dangerous cells as one method for treating the disease.
This process involves removing body cells from the patient, altering them into the laboratory
Then they can “see the proteins that are high in cancers and then undergo injections of an injection. ”
An artificial vaccine offers hope for a wide variety of cancer patients.
One woman with the aid of the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify dangerous cells, saw her ovarian cancer coming to an end for more than 18 months.
This process involves removing body cells from the patient, changing them from the laboratory to "see" a common protein of HER2 cancer, and reorganizing the cells.
Professor Jay Bezofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our actions show we have a vaccine to help us."
HER2 "reats with several types of cancer, "including breast cancer, cervical, lung and ovarian cancer, Prof Berzofsky, explained.
The same procedure for removing the body from patients and teaching them how to deal with cancer is also effective in treating the type of blood cancer.
After appearing on the SnL, West started the Trust of Trump, dressed in a modern - day Cup of the Greatest America.
An Almost Unbearable Loss
Well, West was despised in a series on Saturday Night Live after the films he thanked the U.S. President and said that the Donald Trump would win the election of 2020.
After singing his third song Ghost Town that night, in which he was wearing the cover written by the Great Union, he spoke harshly to the Democrats and repeated that he was supporting Trump.
"I often talk with the white man and say, "How do you like Trumps, and prejudices?"
So, if I were anxious and prejudiced, I would have left America long ago," he said.
The SNL began the exhibition with Matt Damon where Hollywood expert spoke against the evidence of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Committee on the affairs of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not reported, the West’s comments were sent to social chat rooms by jeepris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock tries to discredit the West and what he lost on the Internet.
On the other hand, West lamented that its cover had suffered greatly because of its cover at the back of the stage.
"She stared at me at the back of the site.
They said, 'Go in there it' is a cover.'
They were bullying!
It is then said that I am in an extinct area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the run?" saying "He’ll wear my champion’s hat, because it means he doesn’t tell me what to do.
Try to show love."
His comments were twice despised by the audience and the SNL members appear to be embarrassed, Variety wrote this, and the same person there says: "The rest of the story was silent."
West was brought in instead of Ariana Grande, whose former girlfriend, the singer Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West has come as a surprise to many when she plays her I Love?
West was assisted by the head of the TPSA group, the Candice Turner who wrote on Tweeter: "To one of the most courageous people: WEATHS. '
But the interviewist Karen Hunter sent a statement to the Twitter that the West was "just what it is and it is very interesting."
"But I chose not to give any prize (when buying music or clothes or to assist "artificial") which I believe he approves and brings dangerous feelings in our area.
They are free.
If we too, she also said.
Before the exhibition began, the singer announced at Twitter to change his name, saying that I am still "Kene West."
He is not the first musician to change their names and follow the examples of Diddy, also Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
A fellow singer, Snoop Dogg was mentioned by Snop Lion and the story of the song that died by Prince, changed his name to a sign and then became known as Prince.
Murderous crime at the Belfast monastery

A movie player of Thornes Kit Harington becomes angry with a frightening concept of masculinity
Kit Harington, known as Jon Snow, in the HBO of Thrones.
But the athlete, a 31 - year - old, argued that such responsibilities mean that young men often feel they have to be mature to be respected.
Speaking with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed that ‘ his substance was wrong' and asked how to deal with the dangerous ideas concerning masculinity in this period # MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, who is 31 years old and also plays the Game of Thorns, admitted that she felt it was necessary to deal with the problem.
'When I am alone, I’m still wondering about this - where did we have to do so?' he said.
'What do we teach men as they grow up, especially in the problems we see here?'
Kit believes that a movie producer may be one factor in the development of the habit, but we are thankful for the good conduct of some of his male participants.
He continued: ‘ What is man’s origin, and what is taught?
What lessons are presented in a movie producer, and in areas that make young men feel that they should be like men?
How can we make this change?
The reason is clear that something is wrong with boys.'
During the visit he also admitted that he would not play any game of Thorns when the game's series came to an end at the end of the morning drama, he said, ‘ won't fight and ride on a donkey'.
Since November Kit has played a part in the resurgence of the True West drama by Sam Shepard, a story about movie artists and her brother who was a burglarist.
The actress says that he feels that meeting his wife, Rose, is the ideal choice he has found in the Game of Thorns.
'I met my wife while painting the movie, and thus I found my lifelong family and my whole life from here,' he said.
Rose was in Ygritte, who had developed love for Jon Snow, the personal name Kit, in a drama that won the prize in the race for Emmy.
Swawa was married in June 2018 in the court of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV and AIDS: China has announced the rise in the number of infected people and 14 percent of the population
The world has reportedly seen a 14 - percent increase in HIV / AIDS.
There are 820,000 people in the country who are infected with the virus, health workers have said.
It was made up of about 40,000 people who attended the seminar in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of these infected people had contracted the virus through sexual contact that caused dramatic changes.
The HIV virus is first spread widely in some areas by means of blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV transmissions through this means has been cut short, said Chinese health officials at a conference in the Yunnan region.
Every year, the number of HIV - infected people worldwide has risen to 100,000.
The sexually acquired Hiv disease through sexual activity has increased dramatically in homosexual relationships.
The ban on female or male relationships in China was lifted in 1997, but discrimination in the country is widespread.
Because of a cultural trend, studies show that nearly 70 to 90 percent of men who engage in homosexual relations eventually marry women.
The spread of the virus in these relationships is due to promiscuous sexual activity.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised to provide HIV - related assistance to all in an effort to combat the virus.
The Maxine Waters said that the worker was the one who issued a message about the Republican Parliament, who said that this was a "bug lie" and ‘ innocent talk'.
America’s representative Maxine Waters rejected reports that workers at her office sent a secret message to the three members of the Republican party on a page on the counselor’s page.
The Waters of the Los Angeles group said that the subject is published by the “people and pages ” of the Internet that tend to be damaging to society.
"This is a lie, a horrible lie," Waters said in a message on the Twitter page.
The message contained the addresses and phone numbers of Sns, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hash, Utah.
It appeared on the fourth page of Capitol Hill in the hands of a secret criminal who had been appointed as Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court of Appeal.
The message was released when the three advisers questioned Mrs.
The Conservative Web sites such as the Gateway Puldit and RedState have also stated that the IP address that identifies the source of the site were connected by Waters's office and publishes more about the Watersman, says Hill.
"This article is an absolute lie," Waters said.
"My office workers who have been named and its secret message and security has been posted on a chain because of a case-to-do is not the one who issued the message.
This is an utterly false story."
Waters ’ comments have been criticized by a number of people on the Internet, including the former secretary - general of the White House of Ari Fleischer.
"This refusal is an expression of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that he has no potential to be a Minister for the House of Commons.
If someone is falsely accused, there is no need to feel angry.
Do not be a critical, disrespectful attitude toward authority.
Get involved.
She should be calm and reassuring.
Fleischer seems to have met up with the Waters ’ speech and condemnation of judges, Kavanaugh and Democrat, who were criticized for answering angry questions on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a representative of the Republican movement who wanted to remove Waters from the central taxes of their empire, also spoke at Twitter.
He wrote on Twitter.
In his speech Waters said that his office had informed the chiefs and the police of the case.
"We're going to make it known to the people who publish this," she continued, "and they will be judged according to the rules, because it is dangerous and disturbing to anyone working at my office."
The torment of Johnny English Strikes Again - Myth of Atkinson’s ungainly art
It is now well known to challenge the benefits of the British Revolution in the European Union in every British film, and this also takes place in the events of other Johannesburg English film, which began in 2003 with the JONny English film and returned in 2011 by a recompulsion film by Jonny English Reborn.
Could a casual, sarcastic, and sarcastic speech in this matter show the world’s disparity as it is commercial?
At any rate, Johnny English with big eyes and blind eyes had the ability to do things a second time — showing that he had the potential to produce a humorous English - speaking movie.
She is an important person who even pretends to be what she is like in the eyes of a policeman, a Beanman, and a British official who is similar to the Cariots of Fire in the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The story comes from Atkinson’s visit to an ancient movie business of Barclay’s movie starring in the air.
There’s a pleasant setting for a grand audience or two in this new Johnny English movie.
I was happy when Johnny English was followed by an airplane wearing old armory and knives running on his shoulder.
Atkinson's ability to have a good sense of humor is seen, but its laughter appears to be less deeply and less elaborate than ‘ marvelous ’ because of the fact that the 947 films and Mission Inpostible have the best sense of humor.
His humor looks more like that of children than adults, and Johnny’s visits to me are less artistic and more natural than Atkinson’s films and were like Bean.
At the beginning of this article, it shows that Britain is in serious trouble.
Some computer users have resorted to British security systems for British detectives, and released a message for all the British soldiers in different parts of the world, which has disturbed a soldier in a certain area but a small part of the exhibition by Kevin Eldon.
It is the last thing of a senior high official who is self-conserving and suffering, who sees the problems in his political career: Emma Thompson is in the part he took in a spectacle like Teresa May, but in the movies there is nothing to add to it.
His wise counselors tell him that since each party has been confused, he should hire someone else.
And this means Johnny English, a high - school principal, who teaches about the operation of a secret - working soldier: the pope has some good things, while the English teaches various children to handle them.
The English had suddenly been taken to a convention in White Hill for a surprise and met with a longtime colleague, Bough, who was also taken by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, married to an army commander, a part of a self - sacrificing human whose role was ill - handled by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus it is that Batman and Robin who handle military affairs in the hands of the great emperor have also worked, who meets Olga Kurylenko’s son, Ophelia Bulletin, the motive - giving agent.
In the meantime, the prime minister is distracted by the activities of a rich man who claims to be able to solve the computer problem: Jason Volta, taken by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough have started their mission: by pretending to be food suppliers, they set fire on the French dining - room fire; this brought them to the Volta’s upper train; and English provoked the confusion when they wanted to use a listening system to see what was inside the Volta home.
All the final events take place in the final session, but in its delightful and self - fulfilling setting, it is shown to be a child movie in all directions.
A little bit interesting.
As was the case with Johnny’s other films I couldn’t think: Can’t British filmmakers share the Rowan Atikson’s ability to discover his art?
The Labor Organization denies that it makes a provision for the British to work four days a week but only five days ’ wages
The Jeremy Corbyn party has had a big idea that they see British citizens working four days a week but are paid five days.
The goal, say the public, is to provide workers with a full day’s pay for an AI (aI) break to pay off a day’s rent.
This system allows workers to have three days of rest, but it does receive the same wage.
According to the findings, this idea can be a "coordination" to the economic ideas of the political state and a feeling of national change for the benefit of the working.
A four - day shift to jobs a week had been approved by Employees as a means of benefiting workers from occult progress.
An official from the Labor Party party told The Sunday Times: 'Reviewing of the project is expected to be announced within a year.
'It is impossible a day, but a four-day working system on a week is well suited to the political principles so that workers can benefit from economic progress and new policies.'
The Labor Organization is not beginning to confirm such a view, where the Green Group promised four days of work on the Sabbath during election in 2017.
However, these are not the sentiments of all members of the Labor Party.
A representative of the Labour Party said: 'The four-day Sabbath is not a political point and is not thought of by the party.'
Wellow Chancellor and John McDonnell used the opportunity of the Labor Party conference after a week had been able to express his opinion on how human resources can benefit the world.
Mr. McDonnell says that he is determined to restore power from ‘ hopelessly optimistic therapists' and 'help' of the relief companies.
The aim of the leader also means that those who share in the water companies may not return their funds as well as the Labor government may cause an ‘ scrape off some of the money for reasons they feel are wrong.
He also established a plan to register 10 percent of the workers, which could cost £500 a year.
A Lindsey Graham, by John Kennedy of "60 Minutes" as a FBI survey in Kavanough may change their opinion
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanough has postponed his last vote in the Supreme Court’s election for nearly a week and raises the question that if the office’s results in research should be changed for any state of the Republican to be of help.
In a conversation that was broadcast on Sunday, a journalist of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked for the ministers of the Republican society John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would cause them to change their thinking.
Kennedy spoke more openly than his South Carolina friend.
"To be true, that’s the same," said Kennedy.
"As I go to hear this case, I have spoken to Justice Kavanough.
I sang to him after these things, and his words went out, saying, 'Did you do this?'
He was courageous, determined, and absolutely sure. ”
Graham’s gun, however, is apparently not going to be fired.
"My view of Brett Kavanough is consistent and I must change only when the case is serious," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know only this: Brett strongly rejected it, "Graham has shouted, about Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who calls him can't prove this.
It is an event that took place 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything that can change in the meantime."
What is the International Year of Music, and what has this celebration done to reduce poverty?
On the following Saturday, New York City is the host of the celebration. It is held each year and that various musicians sing for the same purpose, ending poverty worldwide.
This year the seven-year festival will include thousands of visitors to the Central Park park in order to be entertained by musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, as well as the public distribution of the event that will be the real purpose of the celebration to end poverty by 2030.
The International Music Festival, which began in 2012, is a part of the Global Poverty Project, which is fighting poverty in a global conflict with the growing number of people who are fighting poverty.
To receive a ticket to the celebration (only if you want to buy a ticket for the well-being), attendees must perform various activities or services such as commitments, e-mail to the president of the country, phone calls or any other clever means to help publish the cause of poverty.
How successful has the commemoration been?
Is the provision of free access to the music industry a legitimate way of getting people to action or some other way of waging war on the Internet to feel that they are doing something better by signing a document on the Internet or sending messages to Tutata?
Since 2011, organizers of the Annual Meeting have reported to have gathered some 19 million members to fight for various purposes.
These events, they say, have been a source of encouragement to world leaders and organizations offering $37 billion to help care for the population of 2.25 billion by 2030.
Early in 2018, the organization listed 390 steps from its own initiative — $10 billion or more.
The combined income of this organization has had a profound effect on the lives of 649 million people on earth.
Among other things, such as the UK, which is in operation "to help children to grow to maturity," which promised to help Rwanda with $335 million to cope with children’s distress, this happened after the commission received the commission’s commission’s commission of Tuta’s 4700 messages.
"With the aid of the UK, people want good, international governments, and people like you, we can stop the dance" of one of the health advocates, Tracy Ullman told a group to watch music in London in April 2018.
By means of over 5,000 voices, the UK was encouraged to promote the health of mothers and children, and the government announced financial aid for the five million mothers and children.
In answer to the question they received on their online network asking, "Who are you thinking we can get over poverty?"
The group replied: “It will be a struggle, a hard fight, and at times, we will get tired and do not give up.
Yet, if the prevailing liberation movement existed in the past, we too can achieve our goals because there is power in one.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monanie and some of the performers at New York’s festival, which would be conducted by Delorra-Le Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
The United States is able to use the military "exploit" Russia to send foreign powers.
The United States, ‘ if necessary, ’ uses its Ocean basins to supply the precious stone and power from Russia to trade countries, including Asian countries, US Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner's report.
Zinke said that Russia’s work in Syria, where the country’s work is being done at the invitation of the state’s recognized government and the false means of obtaining precious stones by power.
"I believe the Russian government has sent its citizens to Asia to find the market of its power as it is in European recognition," he said.
In fact, he added that there are ways to overcome these.
"The American country has such a potential, with the use of our Sea Forces, we can open the gates and if necessary we can prevent their power from reaching the market," he said.
Zinke says this in an area prepared by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that calls itself “the mouth of the powermen ” in America.
He said that the fight that Washington would fight with Russia is the same as he did with Iran, saying that his goal will be the same.
"The means of obtaining Russian and Iranic resources, and the same, increasing and transforming oil," he said, comparing Russia with "a good gain" on oil.
This has come to be when Trump’s government is on the European oil market, replacing Russia with a low - cost oil supply.
In this case, Trump’s leaders, including national leader Donald Trump, are trying to force Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 policy that had dealt with Russia, Trump said that the program had made Germany a “slave ” of Russia.
The Russian country has been arguing that the Nod Stream 2 of billions of dollars, which must increase its activity to a level of 110 billion cubic feet [110 billion cu m] in length and at its limit, is just an economic agenda.
Russia has declared the U.S. economic hatred and hatred as an example of the world’s oppression of commerce.
"I believe we agree that power markets are not a threat to others and that power users must have the opportunity to decide for them to sell them," said President Aleksandr Novak after meeting U.S. Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American community was not pleased with Germany, and Germany insisted that it continue to function.
The Federal Trade Center of Germany, the Federation of German Inquisitors (BDI) has asked the United States not to interfere with the European Union on power and cooperation between Germany and Russia.
"I feel very upset when a country joins in the purchase of power," Dieter Kemp, head of the BDI, after the president of the German president of Angela Merkel and President of the Russian state of Vladimir Putin.

Sarah Kanin deals with PTSD’s dilemma about Tack Kiin at a conference of Donald Trump
Track Kanin, aged 26, was one year old in Iraq when it was written on Sep.
She was arrested and charged with household violence on Monday night
"My son’s experience, his return experiences, I can understand other families affected by PTSD and some of the experiences of our soldiers," told the audience at the Donald Trump conference in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Kanin said that his arrest is an "a matter which no one wants to mention" and that of their son and other fighting men, "they have returned a little less reformed, they are back, they come back, they wonder if there is respect for their fellow soldiers and their crew, and every other member of the army has contributed to this country."
She was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on the charge of abuse by a woman, disrupting a domestic - violence report, and bearing a weapon after being drunk, according to Dan Bennett, Prince of the Police Department of Wasilla.
18 regions and D.C. opposition to a new law on the safety of refugees
Eighteen communities as well as the District of Columbia are resisting a new law in the U.S. that rejects assistance from those who flee from terrorism and domestic violence.
lawyers from the provinces and section 18 have filed charges in the Washington court to help a refugee who wants to protect himself against this law, according to the NBC News report.
The complainer’s name in Grace v. which American Civil Liberties Union proposed in the month of Ogasti in opposition to governmental principles is not stated.
She also said that her husband was “but also a mob of her own violent children, ” persecuting her, but the U.S. officials denied her request to leave home on July 20.
He was kept in Texas.
Grace’s attorneys described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which bring more security to the U.S., such as countries suffering from mob violence and domestic violence.
The 2014 U.S. Department of Human Rights has adopted a ruling by the Board of Immigent Appeals that allows displaced persons to flee from domestic violence in order to seek protection.
The Chief Justice of Columbia of Karl Racine stated on Friday that this law is "disregarding the law of many decades of countries, governments, and of all countries."
‘ The law requires that all the complaints of the refugees for threats against the truth and the circumstances, and such prohibition violates this law, ’ the lawyers have said.
The lawyers also pointed out that this anti - inclusive law could damage the economy of the U.S. country, suggesting that these foreigners could become commercial and "be potential workers."
In June, Justice Jeff Sesions ordered judges who handle immigration cases not to provide shelter for those who have been victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
‘ Protection is given to those who have left their homes because of persecution or fear because of their nationality, religion, country, or social or political ideology, ’ the Court did so on June 11.
Being protective does not mean solving all the problems and problems that afflict people around the world each day.
Rescue works are performed at Palu to find survivors while the death toll is doubled
For the survivors, things are getting worse.
“ It’s very difficult, ” said a 35 - year - old mother, seeking comfort from her son who is infected with malaria at a rescue site in Plu’s devastated city.
"Each time a ambulance brings dead bodies.
Clean water is hard to find.
People seem to return to their homes that have been destroyed, carrying their cargo in flooding, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5, were unable to meet the needs.
Some of the victims, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from backaches, were resting outside the Palla Hospital, where patients received help outside because of other serious earthquakes.

He hit me in the ruins of the wall, hoping to do so, "Hass told Associded Press, adding that his family was a tourist to perform the wedding ceremony.
‘ I heard my wife cry for help, and it was silent.
I don’t know what happened to her and to my son.
I hope she is OK.'
The United States has said that China is carrying out a 'dangerous' message.
A week later, a reliable Chinese newspaper published a business message in a four - page American newspaper about anti - American trade in both countries, an American representative said that China is using an American newspaper to publish false news.
Last Wednesday, U.S. president Donald Trump reported on a special section of the city of Des Moines Register - newspaper, sponsored by the Chinese - Chinese newspaper, visited by the president of China’s government in an attempt to interfere with the election of the U.S. intelligence of November 6, which China condemns.
Following what Reuters newspaper told the presidents of America, the Trump campaign on U.S. election had revealed a new American campaign to combat China.
While it is acceptable for foreign countries to put commercial messages into the press, China and America are arguing over the trade, a conflict that has led to the paying of both countries a major tax due to their national enterprises.
China’s tax imposed on American goods was due to counteract trade from Iowa’s cooperation with the Trumps of the Republican, said experts from China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the representatives of China’s American country and the leader of Iowa, who is responsible for most of China’s agricultural communications, said that China’s actions were a source of frustration for American workers, farmers, and businessmen.
Writing in the newspaper Des Moines Register, the Brantad said that "China is writing much of this confusion by sending false commercial messages in our journals."
"In spreading his lie, the Chinese government is using the right to speak and the right of the journalists of America to pay for commercials in the Des Moines Register," wrote Brantad.
"In contrast, at the newspaper market here in Beijing, you will find few objections and you will not see any hints that Chinese people have on China’s economic problems, since journalists are in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," they wrote.
Without mention, they added that "one of China’s best - known newspapers had missed the opportunity to publish her story."
The Republican Congregation Takes On Women’s Flame
When many leaders of the Republican party agree with Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment as judge at the Supreme Court of Supreme Court and the Kavanaughs are thought to have attempted rape, experts say that this will cause problems, especially from women in the coming elections.
This issue has caused much resentment, and the Republican movement has openly announced that it is ready for people to make a choice in favor of the Mrs. Kavanghs.
These items can never be recovered, ” says Grant Reeher, a professor of political studies at Maxwell University of Syracuse.
Reher says that to encourage the FBI’s investigation of Arizona’s regional adviser Jeff Flake will be able to get rid of their tempers.
"Mom will never forget what happened tomorrow or November," Karine Jean-Pierre, chief female lecturer for the Mother group Moveon on Friday, according to reports in the Washington DC.
On Friday morning, players sing "November coming!" when they perform exhibitions in the law building where Republican board directors decided to continue with the Kavanaugh's election despite the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said the Mic newspaper.
"An interest in the subject of democracy is on the decline," Stu Rothenberg, a political expert told the newspaper.
‘ People say the interest has always been high; they are right.
However, it could be particularly high among local women and young people aged 18 to 29 who may vote, who do not like the president, but do not vote."
Even the evidence of for Ford that the Kavanoughs want to be captured publicly, experts say that if the Republican movement could prove their party of the Kavanh people’s choice, it would be very angry.
"These have shown the wrongness of the GGP party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, a week ago according to NBC newspaper reports.
"It is not related to the committee's votes or final votes or to the appeal of Kavanough not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the way the Republican party has handled the matter and how she has dealt with it," Guy Cecil, director of the U.S.
On the other hand, Americans seem to have a wide range of opinions on the question, based on the evidence of Ford and Kavanough, and most on the Kavanough side.
The new Yov University showed that 41 percent of the city’s participants believe in the Ford evidence, and 35 percent said that they believed the testimony of the Mrs. Kavanoughs.
Moreover, 38 percent said they thought the Kavanoughs had lied on their testimony, and 30 percent said that the Ford had lied when they gave their testimony.
Following in the case of the Flake, the FBI is researching the subject presented by Ford and Deborah Ramirez, says the Guardian newspaper.
A Ford, who took an oath to testify to the Parliament of Appeals in the parliament last week, said that the Kavanoughs who had been drunk wanted to rape at the age of 17.
Ramirez said that the Kavaoughs were shown their naked bodies after going to a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The founder of the World Wide Web page wants to set up a Web site to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Le, who set up the World Wide Web page, sets up a web page to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google pages.
The new project, called the Inrupt, is a company that is willing to continue when the Solid project made by Berner-Lee was limited.
The Solid document allows users to make their own decisions and to allow them to choose the information they want to see.
Speaking in particular with the newspaper Fest Company, the Berners-Lee made jigsaw as the goal of Inrupt is "supp.."
"We have to do here," he said about the page.
"It’s good news."
The program will use the Solid program to allow people to make a "extract site" or POD.
The program is capable of preserving, performing, calendar, storage of music and other personal activities and activities.
It is as if Google Dre, Microsoft Outlook, Black, and Sphotify are grouped together.
A remarkable feature of the site is that the user has the right to choose whom he or she wants to see.
The company cites the introduction of the program as "encouragement by message."
The chief executive of the company, John Bruce, said that our attitude toward the Inrupt was that of bringing goods, roads, and skills necessary to make Solid available to all.
At present the company is Berners-Le, Bruce, security systems purchased by IBM, other computer workers employed to organize the program, and various volunteers.
From this week on, computer experts around the world have been able to design their own software using the Internet.
Bernners-Le said that she and her assistants are not talking to her owners of the "Facukok" and Google about a complete change in which they may be able to get all their troubles temporarily.
"We don't ask their permission."
On the subject set up on the Medium site on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Introit is the purpose of providing commercial powers and how the environment affects the environment to protect the economy and the benefits of the new system from the Sold hi."
In 1994 Berners-Le changed Internet use when she established her Web page, World Wide Web at Massachusetts's Massachusetts specialized school.
During the past months, Berners-Le has been talking about the opposition of all the people who make up the Internet programs.
Even if established Enrupt, Berners-Le will still be the master of the World Wide Web program, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very hopeful of this new program," said Berners-Le.
Bernard Vann: A pastor who received Victoria Cross after World War I was celebrated by WW1
Only the pastor of the Church of England who earned the Cross Victoria’s thirst during the International War if a soldier was celebrated in his home city a century ago.
On September 29, 1918, pastor Bernard Vann was caught in a robbery in Bellingise and Le Haucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a secretant soldier, and he was unaware that he had found the highest thirst in the British army.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was displayed by his two grandsons on a carpet in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his descendants, Michael Vann, said that it was “the best thing, ” that the stone should be shown a hundred years after his grandparents got that thirst.
According to the newspaper London Gazette, on 29 September, Lt Col Vann led his soldiers across the Saint-Quentin River "in which is thought and is being shot heavily by a machine gun and a machine gun."
Then he rushed forward and, as he himself, led his men to pick up a rifle and kill the soldiers of three small groups.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German refugee soldier on October 4, 1918 - a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says that his grandmother’s actions were "the things I know I can’t do but teach us to be humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, who are led by the Brentwood Imperial band.
Michael Vann said that he felt "be honored that he was part of the captain's staff" and added that "the courage of the stork is seen by most people when they remember them after they fall down."
The following MMA did not sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but was shown to Pepa Pig
Imagine, you didn’t sleep all night to see the giant Bellator 206 playing games and finally not to be seen.
The list from San Jose was 13 arguments, including six on the main card and was shown all night at the UK on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Roy MacDonald were preparing for the fight, UK viewers were surprised when the program was changed to Pep Pig.
Others have been disappointed that they stayed up late, especially since they had expected conflict to begin.
Another of the following has commented on Twittter’s transition into children's identity as "smile."
"It is officially the law that this was not to be shown in the morning should be turned into a child program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator, the second chief to the conductor and co-ordinary, after being asked about the matter.
"Apppeg," yes."
The president of the Bellator Scott Coker company said that he would consider their program plans to include the UK vision.
Thinking about repeating the program, I think we might be able to do so," said Coker.
"We can't do this until Sunday, Monday, their time.
But we work hard to improve.
In fact, the time it changed had there been an abundance of references to it, and not all of them were good.
After much hard work to repair, we decided to consider if the machine had a mechanical problem.
But not so, for it was a government affair.
I promise you that it will never happen again.
We will prepare five fights instead of six - as we do - and have tried to feed our images further and have just missed the point to do so.
It’s very difficult."
Conversations on Desert Island: Tom Daleley's 'secretion' has to do with a group of people he likes.
The Olympic Games champion had grown up to protect himself from the influence of a favorite group, but this gave him much encouragement to succeed.
The 24 - year - old expert said he didn't realize until he got to high school that "no one is like me."
Speaking on the Desert Island’s first four - story program, published by Lauren Laverne, she said that she spoke about the rights of homosexuals in order to give them a "hope."
He also said that being a parent would hinder his ability to make a success of his sports career.
For a few months, the director, Kirsten Young, has been unable to attend this program because of his health problems.
In Laverne’s first program, Daleley said that the way she grew up to feel "we don't feel like" because "it’s not acceptable to love boys and girls."
She said: "To this day I feel that I am an individual and that I am different from other people and the things that have encouraged me and gave me the strength to do well in my sports."
He wanted to show people that he was "his own, ” he said, so that he would not be upset if anyone learned of the group of people he loved.
He who has twice won a football prize in the Olympics has been well - known for the fight against homosexual and homosexual rights and has used his participation in the Combwelath Games in Australia this year to appeal to many countries for their legal rights to same - sex unions.
He said that he spoke because he felt he had the opportunity to remain free even when he expressed his love for fellow nuns so that he wanted to give ‘ encouragement ’ to others.
An American movie star who won three world dramas said that falling in love is a man - Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013.
Dale married a movie star, and his 20 - year - old daughter, Oscar, has spent much of that time alone.
"If you have many experiences at this age" – she still plays the Olympic Games at age 14 and her father died of cancer for the next three years, she said that it was difficult to find someone who met the doors that she had met.
In June the family became the parents of a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Darley said "their vision had changed.
"If you ask me last year, I’m just thinking I won a gold medal," he said.
"Do you know? There are more good things than the Olympic gold medals.
My introduction to the Olympic gold is Robbie."
Her son has the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daleley said that he did not accept his father’s death and wanted nothing more than to see whether his life was in danger of falling asleep in death before his death in 2012.
"I didn't tell them you can't live in the future because you’re going to be dead," he said.
"I held her by the way she died, and only when she died did I realize that she was not eternal," she said.
The following year, Dary entered the Olympic Games and won the bronze race.
"I knew this was my dream of drowning in public in the Olympics, and there was nothing more than that," he said.
This also encouraged his first choice of Provud’s song, composed by Heather Small, which encouraged him to prepare for the Olympic Games and continues to give him a goat.
Desert Island Discses is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at the time of 11:15 BST.
Mickelson who was left out on Saturday’s tape player
Phil Mickelson of America has been making the history of the Church when his 47 fory of the Ryder’s cup, but it must be more than what he has been doing in the past to save it from a bad reputation.
Mickelson, who played the 12th stage in the stage after two years, was put out and played in place by the director, Jim Furyk in four soccer games with four players.
Instead of being one of the players of the day, his performance in the American team who has been winning five times was merely attending to his friends and making plans so as to increase his performance.
The 48 - year - old athletes, who were not the most dangerous in their sporting events, are not the best athletes in the wild in the Gulf National soccer team, who beat the ball at a distance so far that it is not as hard to strike.
And if the competition is not particularly dangerous, Mickelson, in the ninth series, will meet Francesco Molinari, a British race star who played alongside Tommy Fleetwood, who is the first to win its four games this week.
If American athletes, who are left with four fourths at the start of a 12 - game game, may well fit, Mickelson’s games may be very important.
Furyk said he had confidence in this expert, but he said that he did not say much.
"He understood what he should do today, he thanked me and hugged me and told me that he had been ready for tomorrow sports," Faryk said.
"He is self-conserving.
She is a supercompetitive professional who has been doing many team projects in the past, and this week.
I don’t expect him to play two games.
I hope that they will play many games but that’s what they have and how we felt we should have done.
He wants him to play like everyone else."
At Sunday Mickleson's plays is more than Nick Faldo on playing many games in the Ryder cup.
This will result in a full-time performance that is not exactly the same as the individual game.
Mickelson won 18 victories 20 times the equivalent of 7 times, but Faryk says his presence encourages his team.
"He is a good man, a good man, a good man, a good man, ” he explained.
‘ I think the young athletes were pleased when they played with him this week, which was exciting to see.
He gives more than play."
European team leader Thomas Bjorn knows that their leadership can be lost
Thomas Bjorn knows from the past that their leading course in sports can easily change and become a difficult object to protect.
The Danish athlete was playing his first game at Valdermara in 1999, where his leader, the Seve Ballesteros, was running five points above the American team but was able to win the victory with a score of 141 1⁄22 for 131 1⁄22.2.
"I remember that we took the lead in Valdermara; we took the lead in Brookline, where we won, and in Valdermara, but with a few points," Bjorn did so, after seeing a good team in 2018 winning 5-3 Friday and at least 10-6 evenings in the contest of Le Golf National.
Thus history teaches me and everyone in the team that the games have never ended.
We need to work hard in the near future.
Let us go to the theater and go for a walk.
They did not go unnoticed, until we found a record of their success.
Our goal is to try to win this cup, and this is where we should focus our attention.
I have said that I am interested in the twelve players in our team, and we know who we are going to play with the best sports in the world."
Excited by the way his athletes competed in a sporting club, Bjorn said: "I can't feel myself.
Tomorrow’s games are different.
Every morning, it seems, the art of every human life is unique, and this is a difficult task to perform.
It is good to play with yourself when things are going well, but only when you do yourself, if you are in the game, are fully tested.
The message that should be addressed to athletes is that you have to do the same with a man at the games of the day.
Now you leave your partner to play with him, and he should do the same for himself. ”
Unlike the Bjorn team, Jim Furyk will want his players to be more active than the two players, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three fourths of the prize.
Furyk himself has been present on both sides of the change, when he was a team that won the Brookline before being a member of the winning team while the European team was performing a miracle in Medinah.
"I remember everything," he said in reply when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the leader of the year 1999, encouraged his players by the last day of the games.
"We have a number of 12 games, but we have to stand on it as you first saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When this happens, one team of middle - class athletes becomes stressed.
We have organized our games and have played in a way that shows that we would like to do something strange tomorrow."
Thomas has been commissioned to initiate a reduction in the movement and will play with Roy Mcllroy in the main sport, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poloter will play with European team players.
"I put the athletes in this way because I believe it will help us to the end," he said, when he spoke about his choice of the game alone.
The founding of a German battleship has also been changed
A new German battleship was to be set up in 2014 to replace the old steamship used for the Cold War in large countries, but it will not work until tomorrow because of the destruction of the ship's system and the changes in prices, the national newspaper did so.
According to reports of Die Zeit’s newspaper, the formation of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," a new ship leading the Baden-Wuerttemberg has been changed until the first stage of the year 2019.
The ship was to be used by the military in 2014, but the difficulty in carrying it interfered with the establishment of the ship.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships purchased in 2007 will replace Bremen's former ships.
We feel that the ships are equipped with powerful guns, machine guns, gas - bombers, and other modern - day explosives as well as aerodynamics.
Some of the essentials are that the ships can work long before they are designed — it is possible to use them for two years away from our ports.
However, early use of trains — which would have changed the workings of Germany in other countries — means that using them will be possible after the ships are reduced, reports the newspaper Die Zeit.
The failure of the F125 fleet was well - known last year, when German naval forces refused to establish it and were returned to the Blohm and Vols in Hamburg.
This was the first time she had ever been left behind to take the train to the railway company.
The reasons for the return of the ship were not well understood, but German newspapers announced that there were "dangered by the necessary programs and materials" on the ship that would make the ship useless.
The difficulty of systems was a major factor, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships must carry 120 - half of the military passengers on the Bremen's old ships.
Moreover, it was known that the ships were heavy enough to reduce their efficiency and to prevent soldiers from expanding their operations.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" ships weigh 7,000 tons, meaning that they weigh twice as much as the German ships used in World War II.
Apart from the errors of the ship's design, the cost of the entire system of the use of the boat includes training the crew - is causing disturbances.
It is estimated that the price was £3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) and was raised at a rate of £22.2 billion.
The problems associated with these ships become even more important when they are reportedly the decline in the immorality of German naval personnel.
At the beginning of this year, Hans- Peter Bartels, director of the Federal Security Committee in Germany, admitted that he had been left behind on a "quarter.."
The officer said that the case had been long since the old ships had stopped using them but were not supplied.
He concluded that among the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships there was no ship that should be used by the local Allieds.
National Trust exposing the life of bats
A new study carried out at a home in Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how bats use the shape of land for hunting food.
It is hoped that these findings will also shed light on the unique wildlife and help to improve care for the future.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will take a closer look at the best known types and types of soprano pistrelles as well as Daubenton’s long ears in Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special drawings will be placed around the location needed to follow the practice of the bats during this period.
The NHS workers and volunteers will also do research by traveling in various places using manual research tools.
An examination of the sounds recorded by experts will reveal the intensity of the sounds of the bats and what types are doing.
The information map can also be developed to provide more information about the environment and their morals.
Rob Dewar, safety adviser for NTS, believes that the results will reveal areas where bats are vital and how they are used by any species.
This would help them to appreciate the value of caring for their environment, such as cultivating a fine type of grass and caring for the palm - bearing branches and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has dropped dramatically in the past century.
They are at the risk of construction and development that affects the way bats gather to rest during the day and the loss of their habitat.
Air and lightbulbs can also pose threats, such as paper that capture flies and other building materials, as well as the use of cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, because of their night - hunting habits, their ears are more valuable than their eyes when they want to touch animals.
He uses a method that is accurate to identify flies and barricades.
NTS, which cares for the more than 270 old buildings, 38 important farmlands and 26,000 acres [76,000 ha] throughout the country, consider bats very important.
It consists of ten well - trained professionals, often doing research, inspecting the spot where the bats gather to rest during the day and at other times performing rescue missions.
The Society has also established an isolated plant in Scortland in Threehave in Dumfries and Galloley, an eight species of Scots.
David Thompson, director of the site, says that the site is the best for them.
"Here we have the best place for the bats," he said.
‘ We have old homes, many old trees, and all good places.
But there is much about bats that are not yet known, so the work we do here and in other homes will help us to understand more fully what is needed for good living. ”
He also spoke of the need to search for bats before building a house, for destroying one area of the breeding area could kill the fruit bats and 400 children, and this could kill all bats in the area.
The bats are protected, and they are not allowed to kill, torture, or destroy their habitats.
Elisabeth Ferrrell, head of Scotland’s Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to assist.
He said: “We still have much to learn about our bats, and most of our species are not aware of what they are. ”
Ronaldo chooses to touch someone, and his lawyers are eager to print a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has been accused of rape by "false stories, ” saying that people are“ seeking to exalt themselves by using his name.
His lawyers wanted to produce the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which published this article.
A Portuguese football player named Kathryn Mayorga, in Las Vegas ’ hotel in 2009, is accused of rape by U.S. surgeon general, Kathryn Mayorga.
It is said that they paid her $375,000 to avoid saying what had happened, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking to 142 million of his followers a few hours after they were told, Ronaldo, a 33 - year - old, criticized the reports as "false stories."
"No, no, not, no, not."
What has been said today is a false story," five times more than Ballon d'Or did it through a camera.
"He wants to exalt himself by using my name.
It’s Not Normal
He wants to be known by my name but is a type of work.
I am a happy and good man, and the athlete added, smiling.
Ronaldo's attorneys are preparing to introduce Der Spiegel in this case, which is said to be "an unprovable reports on a matter of secrecy," according to Reuters.
Justice Christian Schetz said that the player might ask for tears because of being contaminated of his good behavior to the extent that it is supposed to be the case, which must be the most serious case against the name and rights of the adult in recent years."
The article is said to have been held in the rooms of Palms Hotel and Casino at Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga said that they had returned to the player's room, where they reportedly raped him, according to paper kept at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell after what she said and told her it was "99%" that she had failed by only "1%."
The documents say that Ronaldo had confirmed the couple’s sexual relationship, but they did so after they had agreed on it.
Mayorga also said that she had gone to a police station where pictures of her injuries were taken from the hospital, but later she agreed to resolve the matter on her own because she saw that she was ‘ afraid of being reinstated ’ and was concerned about ‘ being embarrassed in the community.'
Now, 34 years of age, she says that she is trying to change her decision on her own and that she continues to be hurt by what has happened.
Ronaldo was about to win the Real Madrid team from Manchester United, and during the summer he moved to the Jave team in Italy for £100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will always be disappointed' and the issue of the loss of vehicle manufacturers
UK "I'll always be disappointed" if it has lost its status as a global number of vehicles after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He also said that "it affects you" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without a union it would temporarily stop her working on her factory in Burnnaston, near Derby.
"We want unity," says Mr. Clark.
A Japanese automobile manufacturer said that the delay at the end of a nonconformity in the Brexit issue could lead to job loss.
The Burnaston - producing Auris and the Toyota - Hadensis pulled about 150,000 cars last year and 90% were shipped to other European countries of the Union.
"My dream is that if Britain leaves the EU in late March we can see the dark work in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, chief manager of Toyota in Burnaston.
Some UK car manufacturers spoke of their fears about leaving the EU without a partnership on how to buy and sell countries, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that he will close his factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
A major concern for vehicle manufacturers is that the uncertainty of the information on the flow of goods to buyers in case of conflict.
Toyota makes its cars "intricating" by its customers, and every 37 minutes of car access from UK and EU vendors on cars that are designed by customers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a partnership on March 29, there may be disturbances in industrial areas that are said to cause delay and lack of vehicle causes.
It may not be possible for Toota to handle products made one day at his factory in Derbyshire, the company has said, thus making it possible to be stopped.
A Clark says that Theresa May is a future brotherhood between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and it is ‘ carefully laid down to avoid delay. ’
"We want to be united. We want to have a very good relationship that would allow us to say not only about the present victory but also to take advantage of this opportunity, "I have told BBC Radio 4 on the Today's program.
The evidence from not only the Toyota and other designers is that we need to continue the most effective method of giving to the consumer. ”
Weotota could not say how long it would be to be stopped, but in time, he indicated that the increase would reduce the rate of the factory’s sales against other factories and eventually cause a loss of employment.
Peter Tsouvallas, who has worked in Burkaston for 24 years and who has worked as a team in the Unite at the factory, says that its members are concerned: "I’m not going to come again when I lose these jobs.
The government prophet said: "We have established an accurate and reliable system concerning our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein, seniors at White House
The conference of Donald Trump is the second of greatest lawyer, Rod Rosenstein, which ends with "the last week" while the battle against those chosen at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh is going on, says White House's executives, Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises special engineering operation Robert Mueller, who is researching Russian elections, the cooperation between the Trumpists and Russia and what President can do to interfere with justice.
Whether Trump is removed from office by a government judge or not, and thus breaking Mueller’s rights, gossip has developed for months in Washington.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times said that Rosenstein had dealt treacherously with a painting device to create a program with Trump as well as the possibility of depose by means of the 25th decree.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday she went to White House, where there was a report of her efforts to retire.
Instead, the conference with Trump, then in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said "I would" to remove Rosenstein from his job but then the conference was delayed to be reactivated by the Senate Council of Kavanaugh and one of the women who accuse him of sexual immorality, Christine Blesey Ford, all witnessed.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the case for a week in which Kavanaugh was accused, thus delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump’s journalist, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein conference, he said: “The day of this was not established, it could be this sabbath, and I can see that it is late for another week in view of all the other things that the high court is doing.
But we’ll see how it works, and I would like the press to know the latest news."
Some journalists may object: Sanders has never been in the White House since September.
A roommate Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the decline of the meetings was not due to hatred of the "previous popularity" of the "TV" journalists, although he said: "I can't deny the idea that it’s popular."
Then it was said that direct contact between the Trumps and the journalists would increase.
"P president performs more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "Show those numbers."
The press conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but "if the journalists have the opportunity to interview the president of the United States directly, it is better to talk to me.
We are trying to do this very much and we see doing this a few weeks ago, and this will take place instead of having a gathering with the media in which you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump always answers questions when they leave White House or have discussions with respected people.
Public meetings are few and far between.
In New York this week the president may be explaining why, in fact, he makes a free and sometimes unexpected appearance before an audience of journalists.
The secretary of health has written to the EU workers of UNHCR in Scotland because of the Brexit’s fear
A health secretary wrote to staff members of the EU in Scotland’s NHS to express my gratitude for the country I wanted to remain in Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months to leave the UK to the EU.
The Scottish government has already offered to pay a fee for the EU citizens who are working for it.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "This summer, the discussion between the UK and EU on leaving is still continuing, and I expect selections to take place at the end of this rainy season.
The UK, however, also encouraged plans for the future if no unity was involved.
I know that this must be the most difficult time in all history.
That is why I want to review now how I appreciate each worker’s contributions, regardless of where they come from.
My friends from all over the EU, and more, they come as volunteers in the field of health care as well as in the patients and in the area where we serve.
Scotland is truly your home, and we would like you to be here."
Christion Abercromia — Sudden Surgery
Conservatives of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie was operated after his head was injured on Saturday when his team bowed down 31 to 27 prisoners and the Vanderbilt Commonores team, Mike Organ, a Tennessee journalist.
The Tennesse State team teacher Rod Reed told the journalists that the injury took place at the close of the first section.
"She came to her side and was unconscious," Reed said.
Teachers and hospitals put Abercrombies on oxygen in the yard before putting him on a mattress and took him to a hospital for a thorough light.
An official at the University of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV newspaper in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was released from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no ‘ news of his early injuries, ’ and the Tennessee State surveys to find out when he was injured.

Foreign buyers will be paid high taxes when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay high taxes when they buy property in the UK, and additional funds will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plan
This concept hinders Corbyn’s success in attracting youths to vote for him
Additional taxes will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes to the UK
Financial resources are expected to earn as much as 120 million dollars per year to assist the homeless
Foreign buyers will pay high taxes when they buy property in the UK - and the extra income will be used to help the homeless, which Theresa May announce today.
This idea seems to be a hindrance to Corbyn’s success in tempting young people to vote with low - cost housing promises and to improve those who have received a lot of money.
Additional taxes will be given to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes to the UK, and additional funds will contribute to the State’s program dealing with sleep problems.
In addition, this includes the current tax collection, including the high portion set up two years ago in old houses and houses purchased to make a rent - it may be about three percent.
Economic forces expect to make as much money as 120 million a year.
About 13 percent of the new building materials in London are purchased by non - UK residents, raising trees and making it difficult for the first buyers to make the first house - to - house section.
Most affluent areas of the country — especially within the cities of greater size — have been like "distant villages" because of the increasing number of foreign buyers who live for a long time outside the country.
The new policy comes in a few weeks after Boris Johnson announced that taxes must be cut down to help many young people build the first house.
She was criticized by large companies for raising household prices by buying land but not using them, and encouraged Mrs. May leave their assignments in low - cost homes in order to arrange for "home consideration."[2]
Corbyn has announced a list of beautiful plans for new buildings, which include adjustments in the rent and the loss of an ‘ innocent ’.
They also want to provide the platform with the greatest energy possible to build new buildings.
May's mother said: "Last year I have given my first responsibility to fix Britain's dreams - so that life will be better for each new generation.
And this means repairing our damaged house market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build comfortable lives here.
However, it may not be possible for people who are not in the UK, and outside companies, to buy homes as hardworking British citizens.
For many people, having a home is considered impossible, and sleeping under the bridges remains a reality.."
Jack Ross: My main goal is to teach the Scotland team's
Sunderland team teacher Jack Ross says that "his main goal is to be a Scottish team teacher at one time.
A 42 - year - old native of Scotland is enjoying the work of the North-east bulb, which is still the third place in the League One, with three signatures from above.
They had moved to the Stadium of Light this summer to lead St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership.
‘ I wanted to play my country.
I got a B level and so," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports.
"But I grew up and helped Scotland and Hammpden as a child, and it always reminds me of the past.
The opportunity will come, except, after I have done well to improve the clubs."
The first Sunderland manager was Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
A former teaching teacher from the Alloa Athletic says that he did not fear to follow the names so well - known in the capital, when he rejected what Barnsley and Ipswich Town offered.
"My victory is yet to be proved by the answer to the question 'Can I be able to return this class to Premier League'?'
Because of the design and materials available in the classroom, it is apparently the Premier League," he said.
"It’s a very difficult task to get there, but I just feel good about it if I can get it back there."
Ross has been in his administrative office for only three years, having served for a long time as a assistant to the Dumbarton department and for 15 months as an ordinary staff of the Hearts class.
He then helped Almaa not to be placed in the third group, and he helped the St. Mirren’s classes, which were on the verge of losing the race.
Ross now feels more comfortable in his sporting career than in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
It may have been a time for making a big decision, "remembering, teaching the Alloa website.
‘ I really believed that the oversight was more appropriate to me than to play.
It sounds strange because I have a good job, a better life, and other interests.
But playing sports can be challenging.
There are many things to do every week.
I continue to feel stressed and under pressure at work, but the management work is much better for me.
I always want to be in charge and now do it, I feel better than ever in my adult life."

The study found a suitable time for 5.30 drinks on Saturday evening
Summer heat has benefited Britain’s drinking companies who are suffering but have caused many problems in restaurants.
Alcoholics have seen an increase of 2.7% in alcohol sales during July - but their profits in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, the CGA, who specializes in these statistics, said: “The sun’s heat - and - take of an unexpected portion of England’s World Cup Games will make July events comparable to June, while the sales of alcohol have seen an up to 2.8 percent increase, apart the restaurants that have suffered severe hardship.
A drop of 1.8 percent in restaurants in June was still in July.
And indeed, everyone who sells alcoholic beverages has a more elevated level of performance than a restaurant.
Food and drink businesses have also suffered in summer, although they do not suffer as restaurants.
It seems that people simply want to drink to drink.
The successful business of alcohol has seen an increase of 6.6 percent in that same month, and food suppliers have dropped by 3 percent. "
Paul Newman, who is a Reservation and hospitality to RSM said: “The following goes on to what we have seen is taking place since the end of Epril.
Climate change and social or sports events have a profound effect on the sale of items outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to suffer, but 4.8 percent of the annual losses are a major problem especially with the increasing demand for pay.
The hot summer may not be a good time for the food vendors, and the passing of time will reflect the cold we met in August to provide needed relief.
The increase in the sale of liquor and greedy commerce, including recently opened businesses, was 2.7 percent during July, to show a decrease in production of new products.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is responsible for researching UK drug and restaurants and recognizing 47 groups, with one value of $9 billion, and their products are highly reliable.

This article reinforced the fear that pornography was transmitted
Twenty - two percent of the students said that they had a white ‘ big ’ list to identify their parents, as well as other secrets.
A woman who had met a secret aunt for her 13 - year - old daughter noticed that the teenage girl was encouraging others to “take her. ”
Research, by the Digital Awards UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistres" Conference (HMC) in non-governmental schools, found 40 children in the 11th to 18th century that they had two accounts, and half of them agreed to keep secret accounts.
Her senior HMC Mike Buchanan said: "I am sad that many young people are tempted to create chat rooms that are unknown to their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the words of the athletes ” of the Scottish Atthletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected a member of the Scottish Atthletics Commission as the presiding officer at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a highly athletic athlete in Scotland and a top athlete and chairman of Ian Beattie described the choice as a good opportunity for those who are preparing the games to benefit from the many worldwide experiences of the past ten years.
"Eilidh has a great respect for all Scottish, the UK and the world's athletes, and it is hoped that the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him to the team," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I want to be like the athletes's words, and I hope to help improve the game in Scotland."
An American, who won 200 feet [200 m] and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta between four Olympic gold discoverys and is now a well - known BBC expert, was left unable to walk about with a drug problem.
He wrote on Twitter: "Last month I had a stroke.
I can’t walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell whether I would recover or how much.
It was a difficult job, but I recovered, now learning to walk again, and today I’m doing what I’m doing in a hurry!
Thank you for a message of encouragement!"
The presentation of a milk mill that compares women to cows has resulted in a variety of comments on the Internet
The milk - pumping company has dropped various comments on the Internet and ads that compare women who are breast - feeding to milk cows are being forced.
In order to ‘ start a secret tube, Elvie’s company has set up a song containing a comic - page film that is given to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers in a grassed cowhouse sing the song with the words: "Yes, I kept calm, but you didn't see the tail" and "if you didn't realize that these were not the cows, and my real breasts."
The song went on: "Ponika, the company, and nursing the children, the company, the company, and my women's breast."
However, this information, which has been published on Facebook’s page, has brought on the Internet a wealth of information.
With 77,000 spectators and hundreds of notes, the film has been received in a variety of ways and characters, many say that it is having the "fear" of the milk industry.
It is an extreme idea of using milk cows to feed the machine.
As we must take in and give birth so as to produce milk, unless their children are removed within a few days after giving birth, they have "exploited another."
Elvie’s hip is well fitted during the bunker (Elvie / Mother)
Another said: "I’m sorry for both mother and child.
But why not use it to burn breast milk for mothers who care for their babies?'
Another added: "This is such a conflicting advertising."
Some had preferred the return, while the mother in particular admitted that this song was "my mirth."
‘ I think it has a good idea.
I would have one if I were still breast - feeding.
It makes me feel like a calf.
This promotion is not as appropriate but is not angry with it.
This is a wise thing, ‘ he wrote it down.
Another said: "This is an interesting thing about women who pump out (often at work or toilet) and feel like ‘ milk cows."
This is not to promote gratitude or to judge the milk industry.."
At the end of the film, a group of women reported that all dancing had these secretions.
This concept is based on the understanding that many nursing mothers say they feel like milk cows.
Elvie Pump, however, works quietly, without a piece of cloth or a suit and is well enough in bed clothing, and allows the mother to move, grab her children, or even move away at the same time.
The children Bararin, their partner and ECD on Mother also said: "Elvie Pum is such a new thing that should be started with care and interest.
Comparing mother to milk cows, we wanted the campaign to clean the beds and their difficulties, showing them in a pleasant and easy way to remember the freedom that this new park will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie’s camp has been established.
During London Fascist Week, a mother of two children appeared on the scene of a designer Marta Jabowski working on this camp.
Hundreds of children who have moved abroad secretly to a construction camp at the Texas border
The number of children moving to another country has increased and even crossed the limits of the month, possibly because of the fear of a point introduced by the Trump government that has made it difficult to deliver children to the helpers.
Traditionally, many volunteers have moved to another land without a permit, and they are afraid to sacrifice their privilege of living in the country when they come in for a child to help.
The problem was growing in June, when the authorities announced that those who want to solve the articles and other adult members of their families should present their own handwritten documents, and that they should share with those who are responsible for the entry and discharge of the people.
Last Sabbath, Matthew Albence, the head of the Immigation and Customs Enforceing, testified before Congress that the council had arrested many who had registered to assist these children on their own.
The commission later established that 70 percent of those arrested had no record of criminal activity.
"About 80 per cent of those who are helpful or members of their family are in the country, and most of these are strangers who have a history of making cases.
Therefore we continue to hunt these people," says Albence.
In order to aid the children zealously, the authorities have set up new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their custody, not after 60 days, as they had previously done, according to sleep workers.
Many will appear by means of a television station, rather than in a direct way, when extending their request to the judge of the people in the world.
Those who may seem unworthy of help will be promptly restored to their homeland.
After long periods of sleep, children may experience anxiety or frustration, which can lead to violence or escape, according to sleep and reports that have been published in recent months.
The lawyers have claimed that there are growing resentments in such large areas as Tornillo, while signs of child suffering are often ignored as a result of the size of such areas.
They have also added that bringing children into low - risk centers with little time to prepare them or to hang around others is likely to lead to hurt feelings that many have already suffered.
Syria tells the war on the US, France, and Turkey to leave quickly
When speaking to the UN General Assembly the Foreign Minister Wal-Moualem also invited the refugees from their Syrian refugees to come home, even in the eighth year of war.
Moualam, second-born to Chief Chief, said that these foreign troops were illegal, falsely charged against terrorism, and "will be punished equally."
"It should leave immediately without anything said," he said at the meeting.
Moulem has insisted that "the war against terrorism is nearly over" in Syria, where more than 330,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He also said that Damascus would continue ‘ to fight this holy war until we had rid Syria’s entire colonies of outlaws and ‘ foreigners. ’
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially teachers and trainers of the Kurdish and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 military men on duty in a war - torn country.
In the case of the refugees, Moulem said it was good for them to return, and he rebuked the "other western nations" because the "excluding of unnecessary fear" kept the refugees from wanting to return.
"We have asked for foreign countries and relief agencies to help those who want to return," he said.
"It includes politics in a matter that should be of concern only to the public."
The United States and the European Union say that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political alliance between the Assad and opposition to the war.
The UN General says that the recent cooperation between Russia and Turkey to establish a final security center has a large number of Idlib revolutions offered an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The cooperation between Russia and Turkey has resulted in the huge persecution of the Syrians, who are supported by Russia’s three million inhabitants.
Moulelem, however, insisted that this union is "the time of the end" and expressed hope that the soldiers will only strike the jidis, including the Nusra Front fighters connected with Al-Qaeda, who will be "exploited."
The UN Staffan de Mistura is hoping to hold the first assembly of a new government committee as well as opposing members to set up the decrees of Syria after the war and to set up a course of action.
Moulem explained how the government of Syria is responsible for it, saying that the work of this group should be intended to "review the local law of the country," and to warn those who want to interfere with it.
Why Trump Takes a Second Break
With that view, A Trump will also be elected in 2020 votes unless, like many observers, justice and crime will end his leadership before it is too late.
In this it may be like "The most amazing end of leadership!."
Since now, there have been no references to burnout.
Since 2014, the number of late - night TV shows in CNN has more than doubled to 1.5 million, with about three to 1 million in MSNC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million night filming programs, from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Madow Show" has a number of long and 3.5 million scenes on a major night of talk.
"This is a problem that is being brought about because it is not what we really understand," said Nel Baer, a BBC drama shower "Desigated Survival," about a secretary to the President after the destruction of Capitol.
Nell Scavell, former comicist and author "Just the Funy Parts: A A few Brothers Against Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club has another idea.
They remember the time they went to college in Boston before the election of 2016.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
She said, "Because it makes me laugh," Mrscovell told me.
There is a pleasant atmosphere in this setting.
In fact, unlike any available TV program, Washington’s programs can tell the future of Roe v. Wade, whether foreign families are able to reunite and economic health worldwide.
Eunuching is a precious asset that can be won by those who have the privilege.
In fact, it goes on to be the most knowledgeable citizen in an hour to see a group of experts arguing about how Bob Woodard uses the "deep history" to obtain his "Fear," Paul Manafort’s $15,000 complex garment (" a garment full of pride, said The Washington Post) and the scientific meaning of the Sexy Daniels's shameful body parts to the Trumps, um. .
I, by one, will never again see Super Mario.
"One of the things they do appear to be a real display is that they give you something to watch every night," "so says Brent Montgomery, chief of the Wheelhouse Intertainment and the Maker of "Pawn Stars," in the series of the Trumps and daily events (designing war with NFL, thanks to Kim Jong-un).
If you were to err in one area, you would still be left in the lurch.
When I arrived at the Fleiss this week, there were 50 degrees below his house in northern Kauai, but he was busy inside the house to watch the MSNBC on the scene.
They could not help but notice the matter, not the case of Brett Kavanough, who is preparing to meet the Senate’s Committee and the future of the Supreme Court, which is based on the outcome.
"I remember where we had all the history show and the people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," the Fleiss told me to do so.
"I think it’s just a joke, but it's obviously true."

Large amounts of money are used to assist between counselors
Little wonder that the 17th cent of Pennsylvania is seeing the use of more money, thanks to the reemergement of legal entities that allowed two people to compete with each other on the same seat.
The recent reorganization of the Pittsburg map allows Conor Lamb who represents the Democrat party to buy a portion - who also won his seat in another section in a recent special election.
A Lamb competes with another member of the Republican movement, Keith Rothfus, now settling in the late 12th part of Pennsylvania, which is directly linked to the 17th century.
The map was changed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after it ruled in January that the former sections were changed to the Republican party.
The competition in the new region of 17 has established greater spending on the park between the major economic groups, the DRM Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The Lamb's name has become a popular name in Pennsylvania after a little won in a special election seen in the 18th section of Pennsylvania.
For the next ten years, President Donald Trump won the province with 20 signatures.
The politicians have given the Democrats a small measure of success.
The U.S. tested El Salvador for Support, and then it went back
The diplomas tell us that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already begun working with Beijing, without a major ban on Washington.
A Trump had lovingly held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until their friends had removed the Trump Governing Body.
Government officials have decided to invite American constituents who work in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent choices that no longer understand Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the minister of the department, said in his opening remarks in this month.
But penalties are still considered to be given to El Salvador, which received about $140 million from America in 2017, including drug, social, and economic aid.
The sanctions, which include economic sanctions and abscesss for citizens, would have been devastating for Central America with the largest number of layoffs and most fatal crimes.
As the conventions were in progress, officials in North America and Central America stopped the summit in hopes that it would later be held that it described the security and wealth following the same convention last year that seemed to be a means of getting ahead to combat immigrants in the United States.
But by mid- September, the adjacent authorities had indicated that they wanted the convention to progress, ending immediately any idea of a penalty to El Salvador.
The second chairman, Mike Pence, is now planning the convention, now scheduled in mid - October to emphasize the convention’s significance.
And three American delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without severe messages or punishment from Washington.
Prophet of White House a Bolton refused to answer to the arguments presented by three American officials, including two generals, who agreed to discuss internal matters in a private way.
Their accounts were confirmed by the foreign scholars who are close to the officers and also said this in a mystery way.
Learn From History
The next article that follows might be the release of a report by Robert Mueller about the integrity violations of the Trumpians, which is now well documented in human records.
Mueller says that he is also searching to see if the Trump camp had joined Russia in interference with our elections.
When the Parliament changes leadership, the Trumps will find themselves faced with questions to answer to that commission, as they are preparing for a second meeting with the officers, and perhaps eventually a civil court.
There are many questions to answer, and I don’t mean that the suffering of the Trumpians is inevitable even of those like those in Europe.
There are choices that all of us in all parts of the US can decide what will affect the duration of the war.
In 1938 the German authorities were ready to conspire against Hitler, unless the West rejected him and helped the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the terrible years that followed.
The history of the past has been attributed to this unique history, and the process of democracy can be rushed or delayed by this.
Americans face a number of these conditions right now.
What will we do if the Trumps have removed the office of Rod Rosenstein II from Chief Justice, who is responsible for Mueller’s investigations?
This past year, Rosenstein has been in serious trouble since the paper once again claimed that he had proposed a secret registration to the president and that the president was not entitled to office.
Rosenstein found the article The Times wrong.
"How will we respond if a recent appeal to F.B.I. is not enough or unfair to investigate Brett Kavanough's case or if it is established as a judge in the Supreme Court even if there is sufficient evidence of rape and fraud?
And above all, would we vote the council counselors who would make the Trump answer to his charges?
If we do not expect problems, it will take a lot of time for theocratic encouragement to arrive at our destination.
But I hope we do not fail, thanks to the education I had received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been moved to Auschwitz with the same Nazi regime that once lived in my home.
He survived and moved to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to burn a Sabbath plate on a swastika table.
Having such an inheritance, how can I lose hope regarding our future? ’

Graham Dorrans, a Rangers team player, believes that he can succeed in his team team and Rapid Vienna
Ragers has been playing at the door with the Rapid Vienna Thursday team, following the similarities to the Spanish Vallareal team at the beginning of this month, the Ragers must win the Australian team, which will allow them to go to the second European team of European scholars League but to the G.
Graham Dorrans’s having suffered from a fall injury in the middle made him unable to play his first team in this casino until the day he compared the force of the Villarrrea team to 2 to 2 points, but he believes that the Rangers can use his performance as a good start of major events.
"The point we found was necessary for us because Villarreal is a good team," said a 31 - year - old expert.
"We entered the stadium with the hope that we would do well in the games and that we had only one score.
Or we may have achieved something like that when we reached the end of the game, the likes and dislikes — the goal was simply not to worry.
They did well in the first section, and we did better in the second section, and we played well that day.
The fourth is a full - costume drama hosted in the UEFA contest.
Fortunately, we can take all three points but then be a very difficult game because they won the game but we take our greeting to our door and I believe we can stand up and win the games.
Last year it was difficult to deal with my injuries and other changes in the movement, but now things are still in place.
Sports stadiums are good and are popular with boys; training is ideal.
Perhaps we can stand up now, letting the past behind us so that we can do better. ’
Women find it difficult to sleep because they are afraid of making money during their lunch break
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to seek attention, few are talking to their brothers about this.
Nearly half of those who did research in Nationwed said they are talking to their wives about the cost of long - term attention.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
"People want their loved one to take care of them, but they do not take steps to discuss the matter," said Holly Snyder, second president of the nature insurance company in Nationwed.
Here is how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for your needs if you do not fulfill your wishes.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss the matter and how you should receive attention, as decisions may be needed to determine the cost.
Ask your financial adviser: Your counselor may also help you find ways to pay your bills.
Your long - term budget may include a long - term social insurance, a life - insurance bill for this balance or an insurance policy for yourself and your resources if you have money.
Write your legal records: Check legal battles when you are traveling.
Get a health assistant instead of choosing a responsible person to handle your treatment and make sure that the experts follow your wishes if you cannot speak.
At the same time, think about what is involved in your financial situation.
You can choose a responsible person for your financial choices and make sure that your debts are paid if you cannot afford them.
Don’t forget: Suppose your elderly parents are getting very sick and are going to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about health issues?
Take these steps so as to be prepared:
"Not only money should be saved, but who are the stores? He asked Martin.

Man had been shot several times by a gas-file gun in Inlfracombe
A man had been shot several times while traveling home from where he was at night.
The victim, at the age of 40, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, where he was wrapped in chest, stomach and hand.
The police described the shooting, which had taken place about 02:30 BST, as it has been done "in general."
The attacker had no idea who had been shot.
The injuries are not serious, and the police ask for help from anyone who sees this.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated Plu in Indonesia Friday, with the death toll expected to rise.
As a result of the damage to the link, relief authorities were unable to receive much from the region of Donilaa, in the north of the Black Sea, which lies very close to a powerful quake of 7.5 seconds.
In Palla, more than 16,000 people were deported after the accident.
The following are many other stories about Plu and Donitaia, Sulawesi:
This is the largest city in the Central Sulawesi region, located at the end of a small coastal plain on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, which is a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the event.
Donilaa is a region of more than 200 miles [300 km] along the northwestern coast of Sulawesi.
The southern part of the region had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are particularly important for the Central Sulawesi economy, particularly the region around Donishia.
Nickel mines are also made in this region, but they are common in Morowali, a port opposite Sulawesi.
Dog and Donila have experienced several tsunamis over the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Institute.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donilaa
The Tsunami was also held in western Donadia in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Danger Zone and is often involved in earthquakes.
System list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh region of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of devastating earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.

None of the tsunamis ever started, but over 100 were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Great earthquakes struck a large island in Indonesia of the foreigners in Lombok, and more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed tens of thousands of homes and left thousands of visitors with temporary hardships.
Sarah Kiin’s Big Son on the Chains of Family Violence
Track Kulin, the first son of an old Alaskan general and second to the president, Sarah Kilin, was convicted of assault.
Kanin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for family violence, disrupting the record of the case and refusing to be arrested, according to a report released by Alaska State Troops.
According to the police report, when one woman tried to get the police to talk about the cases, she took the phone from her.
Kanin is kept in the Matt-Sutrial Facility and is kept on a $500 security chain, said KTU.
He appeared at the door on Saturday, where he said he was "inexcusable, true" when questioned, said this satellite.
Kiin is accused of three minor charges held in class A, which means that she can receive prison sentences for up to a year and be fined $50,000.
Also charged in class B, with one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Ken has been condemned.
In December 2017, he was convicted of beating his father, Todd Kilin.
His mother, Sarah Kilin, played to the police to tell about the beating
The case is still held at the Alaskan Supreme Court
In January 2016 she was charged with domestic violence, disrupting the court’s record, and having a weapon on the subject.
His daughter claims to have struck him on the face.
In 2016 Sarah Kulin was criticized by older soldiers in the past by tying the account of the abuse of her son to the PTSD who said it was due to his career as a soldier in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday
A 7.5 - magnitude earthquake had triggered a tsunami and destroyed tens of thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are inactive and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the days to come.
This earthquake occurred in the interior of Sulawesi in the northeastern city of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos shared before the media reflect the exact time of disaster.
Hundreds of people had gathered on a beach in the town of Palu when the tsunami reached the shore.
Government judges want those accused of criminal activity in NYC to accept a strange judgment of death
Judges in New York City require that the Syphullo Saipov receive a death sentence, in which he is accused of being a terrorist in NYC and killing eight persons --animity that has not been handed down by a government court since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is said to have used a loan car in Home Decot to be a criminal on a bicycleway near the highway of West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Confirming the merit of the death penalty, the prosecutors must testify that Saipov ‘ purposely ’ had killed eight persons and ‘ deliberately hurt others, according to the law concerning this decision, which was issued to the Southern District in New York.
All such cases are punishable by death, according to the court counsel.
A few weeks later, the high court found Saipov guilty of 22 cases involving eight fraud charges, the highest court cases used in such deliberate cases, and also the crime of violence and traffic damage.
The case was ‘ carefully prepared and well thought out,' the judges did so, describing the case in which Saipov was committed in which he was "fearful, cruel and highly terrible."
"Sayphullo Habibillaevic Saipov had hurt others, as well as the grief of the brothers and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," a request regarding the decision was made.
Five of those affected were from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York decided to be executed.
The Judge, Khalid Barness, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death resolution was presented in New York City was the year 1953 for the Juliuss and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to the Soviet government during the Chopa or Cold War two years ago.
A couple in the Rosenberg family were killed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born of Uzbekistan, showed no interest in what he did in the following days and months, according to court documents.
They have told the researchers that they feel better about what they have done, and the police have done so.
Saipov had told the authorities that he had been encouraged to do this after seeing ISIS movies on his phone, according to much about his case.
He also asked to show the IIS flag in his hospital, and the police did.
He turned down the 22 charges he had made.
David Patton, one of the Saipov's representatives, said that he was "swallowed" by the vote of the state’s judges.
"We think that the idea of accepting a death sentence rather than accepting an appeal to remain in prison and having no right to be released may add to all involved," says Patton.
Saipov’s lawyers had already asked the judges not to punish death.
NIGEL FARGE should oversee Brexit discussions
Nigel Frage had promised that he would ‘ unite a class of people like a war class today in a show at the General Assembly.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should be ‘ forced ’ from EU Opponents - as one of Theresa May advised that it is proper to take charge of the discussion with the EU.
Peter Bone, who was a backler, told the people in Birmingham that the UK 'had been gone out' to the present time if the Fages were the Secretary in the Brexit debate.
But the challenge faced by May in restoring highly divided territories has been confirmed by Brexiters to participate in some exhibitions against Brexit in the city.
He is working to ensure that his policy against the State’s policies is against Brexit, E. U.S. Conservatives, and the EU.
His assistants have insisted that they continue to try to cooperate with Brussels despite the opposition of the EU Opponents and the Labor Organization to decide between what they are offering and 'declusters'.
A Bone told the conference entitled From Out means From Solihull that she wanted to 'oppose the Brexit Connections'.
He also said that Fages would be assigned as part of the territory and would be assigned to communicate with Brussels.
'If it had been the way he was leading the case, if we had come out here,' he said.
The MP of Wellinkíught added: 'I help against Brexit' but we want to oppose the Anti-Brexit Connection.'
Commenting on the opposition to the EU, he said: ‘ We have not fought the world’s wars to become slaves.
We want to make our laws in our own country.'
A Bone rejected the assumption that human thinking has changed since the election 2016: 'It is not true that the British have changed their minds and want to remain.'
Brexoteer Andrea Jenkyns was also on the show, telling the press: ‘ I just say: Sir, listen to the people.
‘ Living in the EU is not a human requirement, the Opponents cannot agree with this, nor do we need our organization and fighters who struggle hard to make a choice.
Please leave the EU and begin listening to the people.'
To the mother of May, she added: 'The Chief Officer keeps his duties when fulfilling his promises.'
Fage told the audience that politicians should be ‘ forced' if they are disloyal to the 2016 taxes.
It is now a reliable subject between us and our political organization, she said.
'They tried to be disloyal in the case of Brexit' and we are now here to tell them that's not allowing you to do this'.'
In his message to the happy group he added: ‘ I want you to force our politicians, who have questionable ideas on the Brexit.
'We' unite the world's community as a war which fought us in the case of Brexit and will not rest until we become the United Kingdom' independent, free and proud.'
In the meantime, they are fighting to be a member of the EU outside Birmingham before holding a two - hour assembly in the center of the city.
Several critics raised posters that President Brexit had set up this group this week.
The conference was opened by a party of the Labour a Lord Adonis who spoke against the Conservatives on the safetys they had experienced with their computer program.
This is the people who tell us that they have been able to establish the IT system in the world as well as the entire trade in Canada in addition, unconventional boundaries, free trade without borders in Ireland,' has increased.
‘ It’s a good joke.
There is nothing better than Brexit,' adding.
Warren wants to "consider deeply" the subject of going to the president's election
Representative Sen. Elizabeth Warren says that "he will think seriously about going to the presidential election" after the election of November.
Boston Globe says that a member of the Massachusetts Democratist spoke about his future at a meeting held in the western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a frequent opponent of President Donald Trump, expects him to be elected in November against the Godp state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was chairman of the Trump camp in Massachusetts.
It is believed that they can fight Trump in 2020
On Saturday afternoon at Hothaba was his 36th meeting with a representative of the session using the question - and - answer method since Trump started working.

It was clear from the fact that Valtter Bottas had defeated Lewis Hamilton on Saturday in the game which went in the other direction that the Mercedes team's rules had a part on all the latter steps.
From early on, the Bottas got a good start, and Hamiliton actually invited Vettel to compete with his team.

This Was Not the Right Way to Use Symptoms
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday conference because he insisted that he did not release a letter from Christine Blesey Ford to appeal to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanough.
In a speech at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly present the evidence given by the Ford before the Senate Committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate is proving that people are being “shaked and scared and lying."
"The only thing that can happen and the best thing that can happen a few days after the journey to Seth is that, when you see anger, you will see people who are angry and angry but who are afraid and who lie," he said.
"Look at the hidden news from the gunman, but when you hear the word "iii, I didn't do this.
I did not do this."
Do You Recall?
Did Dianne Feisstein, do you put them out in public?
Remember your reply... that you had brought them out in public - "iii, eii, what?
No, it is not.
I didn't go out publicly.."
Well, say so.
We took them out in public?... No, not us," he added Trump in speech, which clearly shows that he speaks about the cell.
A Feinstein was sent to report on the Kavanough case that had been brought by the Ford last July, and the issue was openly presented in September-but the Feinstein denied that the distribution had come from their office.
"I didn't hide anything from the case that came with Ford, I didn't report it publicly," Mr. Feinstein told the Sethe Committee according to what The Hill newspaper had written.
"She told me it was a mystery and I kept it."
Such resistance did not please the president of the country, who spoke at a conference on Saturday as such: "I assure you, this was not a good way to speak by physical gestures.
He may not have done it, but it was a dirty way of speaking by signs of the body I have seen.'
In defense of the Supreme Court’s appeal appeal for sexual immorality with three women, the president said that the Democrats were using what they said to carry out their wishes.
‘ They want to regain power through this system.
You find these people to be the worst, the worst, the least caring of the victim in a desire for power, ” said the leader, according to the Median newspaper.
Giant Marbles: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer swallowed two Gians ’ bands against Dundee
The Dundee Stars team returned in a vendetta when it defeated the Belfast Giants team with 5 to 3 prisoners in the soccer matches in their previous White station.
The Belfast Giants led two sticks with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
But the Dundee team returned the two yokes through Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie and then Dwyer of the Belfast Giants team.
Francoi Bouchard closed up the bonds of the gangs and held the same yokes and then Lus Lundvald Nielsen closed the two chains that brought success to the Dundee Stars team.
There was a third defeat in the Elite League's games during that season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come back to battle Dundee 21 at Belfast Friday night.
It was the fourth game among these teams, and then the Giants team won the three previous games.
The first Dwyer’s yoke came in about four minutes after it passed 3:35 through Kendall McFaull, another yoke came from Beauvillier through David Rutherford four minutes later.
It was a very busy opening time, when Sullivan returned the athletes at 13:10, before giving the opportunity to make Cownie a yoke which made them equal at 15:16.
Dwyer encouraged the Giants team for the first break when he struck his second pack in the night game at the end of the first.
The Dundee team that was at their door came up with another idea, and Bouchard made a powerful equivalent of a minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran played skillfully in giving the ball to Nielsen who had given the Dundee chain the team the lead of the team for the first time to the end of the second stage and had added to the additions that made it possible for all five parties in the games.
The Giants ’ team that has now won four games in a row of five is preparing to meet Milton Keynes in the coming Friday games.

Experts list the results until the mother was burned alive
The prosecutor suspended the trial on the father's Saturdays, which had been charged with a murder of a living Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in intelligent research.
She had told the court how she had used mobile phones to include the behavior of 29- year- old lawyer Quinton Tellis and a 19- year- old victim, Jessica Chambers, who had died on the night.
Rowlett said he had received more about the location from several mobile telephones who had indicated that Tellis had Chambers on the night after he died, which is contrary to what he had said earlier, Clarion Ledger said.
When he was shown that he had his phone while he was in contact with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified that Saturday was not a town that day.
When the justices asked if Tellis was true when he was a Sanford car that very night, Sanford said he was ‘ lying, because my car was in Nashville right away. ’
One difference is that Tellis said he had known Chambers about two weeks after his death.
The evidence from the cellular telephone shows that they get to know each other for just one week.
Rowlett says that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed the Chambers ’ writings, most of which are recorded by his name on his phone.
"He takes it out of his life," said Hale.
The opposer is expected to present his final opposition on Sunday.
The judge said that he was waiting for the case to be brought to court that very day.

Three others who play the hip hapu (Hap) are considering changing the impression that the fanatic has some errors by throwing up a message of encouragement in their music.

A black man?
The NY child - care provider is blaming a family for sending a message of "apartheid" to another family
A NY child - care worker blames a family for sending a message of discrimination when he receives a missing message from the mother complains that he was "a black man."
The family rejected prejudice, claiming that it was like "the way of stealing."
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was shocked to learn that this new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of labor in 2016.
"AIIIIIII IS A MAN OF GADA," said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxmanto in a letter to her husband.
However, instead of sending the letter to her husband, she sent it to Mama Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, "Losco-Flaxm" resigned Sister Maurice, saying that she was a former child - carer, an African - American, had worked fiercely and instead expected to find a person from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice found work a day and was sent home to Uber.
Now, Maurice is blaming the family for losing their job, and she wants to be paid $150 a day for six months, a former music concert contract, before the union.
"I want to show them, you see, you don't do things this way," she told Post Friday and added, "I know it’s a prejudice."
She had defended herself against claims of prejudice, saying that quitting work was the wise thing to do, fearing that she would not trust her if disappointed.
‘ My wife sent something for her that she didn’t want to say.
He is not partial.
We are not prejudiced, ” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Will you, however, deliver your children into the hands of someone whom you have treated unjustly, even though it was not by will?
Your new child?
You people.."
Comparing the case to "the way of theft," Plasco said that his wife was only two months before she was pregnant and was "in the most difficult time."
"Can you go out and fight with the person in the situation?
It is not the best thing to do," the banker added.
While the case is still standing, the light court has promptly rebuked the family for their actions and attitude.
The publishers of Paddington’s book fear that readers will not think of a donkey speaking, a new letter revealing this.
After it was accepted, Karen Jankel, the daughter of Band, who was born in this book, said regarding the letter: "It is difficult to replace the person who reads this book before it is released.
It is wonderful to know what we now know of the great success of Paddington’s book.
Regarding his father, an ancient BBC artist before being encouraged to write a book for children and a small bear, it may be frightening for him to be abandoned, adding that the 60th anniversary of this publication was "so bitter and good" after his death last year.
Paddington’s book, which describes it as "what is most important in our family," I add that his father was very proud that he finally did well.
"He was a mild - tempered man, and he was not a blasphemer," he said.
"But because Paddington was very real to her, it was almost like having a child who achieves something: you’re proud of them even if you're not doing it.
I think he had seen Paddington’s success in this way.
Despite his achievements and ideas, he always accords Paddington’s own dignity. ’
My daughter died, and I had to wash my cell phone
When he arrived, he and his daughter ran to the hospital at Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors had worked in vain to save his life.
"Nad was calling frequently to say that it was serious, and that he didn't expect to recover," says Ednan-Lapehouse.
‘ I received a phone call from Nad, who would die within two minutes, and I had to wash her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my loved one.
I will be with you shortly.
I will be with you.
The medication that the doctors gave her to take in her heart was coming out and slowly disappearing from her body.
He had been dead for a short time, and that was just the beginning.
I had to wait, knowing that all of this would take place.
I can’t cry or cry because I was in the environment surrounded by family and other people.
I had to keep them on my own."
Afterward Ednan-Lapehouse, still grieving the death of her daughter, flew along with other people who did not understand the problems she had.
"No one knows that," he said.
‘ My head was on the floor, and tears fell from my eyes.
It is hard to explain, but it was on a trip that I sympathized with Nad.
That she wanted my love and that I could understand her.
I knew how much they loved me.
A grieving mother sends out cards to avoid suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their relatives to suicide are trying not to kill themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been sending cards on Welsh bridge with encouraging messages and telephone numbers.
Tyler, a son of a sister named Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and had committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don’t want any parent to hear how I feel every day," he said.
A 45 - year - old mother, Davis, who lives in Sydney, says that their son had the opportunity to be a good cook with a warm smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
She is always said to have a good sense of humor.
However, he had to give up his job before he died, since he was in “deep trouble. ”
In 2014 her brother Tyler, which was 11 at the time, was found after he committed suicide.
“ I’m worried about the results, ” says Davis.
Sister Davis made the cards, "so you can see that there are people outside you and can talk to them, even with a friend.
Don't just be quiet - you must speak."
The mother, Humphreys, who had been a friend to Davies for many years, lost her husband, Mark, and his 15 - year - old friend, not long after his mother’s death.
She did not say that she felt sad or sad or anything, ” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas we saw the changes he made.
It wasn't very good on Christmas day, but when they opened their gifts, they didn't see them or say anything."
She also said that her death was a terrible one, but she had to endure in this: "She has left her family to suffer terribly.
They separate us.
But we all need to keep enduring.

The future of Brett Kavanough is not revealed when the FBI began searching
"I thought that if we found anything like anything they asked for - such as a short search of time, on a small scale, we might bring a little less," Flake said, she added that she was afraid of the committee that was "falling" during the fierce political war.
Why did Kavanoughs and Republican followers not want the FBI to investigate?
Their refusal is based on events that lie ahead of us.
The central election remains five weeks to be done, on November 6 - a few, as expected, when the Republican party fails, it will be most weakened in an attempt to bring a person who wants to be appointed by the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been making a telephone call to the Senete, encouraging them to assist Kavanough, who worked in White House during the Bush and through him met their wife Ashley, their secretary.
What will happen if the FBI reports it?
There will be a total of 51 registrations for the Republican Party and 49 members of the Democratic Party.
It is not known whether the Kavanoughs can obtain at least 50 votes in the house of Senate, which may allow Mike Pence, second president, to settle the matter and convince him of the Supreme Court.
The number of revolutions ‘ fell down ’ under Kim’s direction
The number of those from North Korea who have rebelled to become South Korea has fallen since the rise of the previous seven years, says South Korea's policyist Kim Jong-un.
A Park Byeong-seg, speaking of more matters from the South Office of the Minister of Cooperation, said there were 1,127 last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the best oversight of the border between North Korea and China and the higher costs that the exports are paid for these lower reasons.
Pyongangs did not say anything about it.
Many of the rebels from North Korea are eventually granted entry into South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Korea had crossed unauthorized boundaries since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many have fled through China, which is located at a distance in North Korea and is much easier to cross than the Damilitated Zone (DMZ) Center (DMZ) between these two Korea countries.
China considers these rebels to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and is often forced to retaliate.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea has changed dramatically in the past months.
At the beginning of this month, the two leaders met at Pyongang to discuss the nuclear weapons they had failed in the past.
This occurred after the Juni conference between the U.S. Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where the two agreed to work in destroying all nuclear weapons in their Korea countries.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister R Yong-ho said that punishments from the U.S. state and what is disturbing the way things have been going on since then.
"If you don't believe in America we will not be satisfied with the security of our country and in these things it’s not possible for us to begin to stop using nuclear weapons alone," says Ri to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "Mama), and I am not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
The leader with a few members of the element Nancy Pelosi says He was elected to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and said he was incompetent to the High Court.
Pelus in a conversation that took place on Saturday in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't do anything but think that if a woman had done this, she would have said, 'Let's go,' then Pelosi would express her opinion about what Kavanough would say as a witness before the Fourth Tribunal Committee.
Kavanough refused cases of rape to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while all were young.
In his opening words, Kavanough was very upset, sometimes shouting and angry about her family and her high school time.
He also criticized Democrats for the Committee, calling their charges "subversive and defecating" designed by the free people who were angry that Hillary Clinton had not won the election of 2016.
Pelus said he believed that the evidence in Kavanaugh had proved that he should not work in the Supreme Court, for it reflected his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he is losing his job and what he says and how he speaks to Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was unsure if she was asked whether she would try to de-duct Kavanaugh in the way of the vote, and if the Democrats had found many members in the Oymira house.
"What I can say — if it is not true in Congress or the FBI, it is not necessary to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in the present court, "Pilus said."
Kavanaugh is still a judge at the DC Ciculutit Court of Appeals.
Pelus added that if a member of the Democrat was concerned with decisions that Kavanough could challenge with the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, he is considered a Democrat lawyer.
In his determined obedience, the Kavanoughs avoided questions regarding whether he could change some decisions in the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a sober, impartial man to go to court and expect us to say, 'It is not good like this,' said Perusi.
Women, on the other hand, need to use this method effectively.
With righteous reproof there, months and years of wrath flow, and they cannot produce those who cry out for it.
"We cry when we are angry," Sister Steinim told me about this 45 years later.
"I don't think it's strange, isn't it?"
She continued, "I was very helped by an older woman who said that she too cried, but she made a plan to get upset and start crying, and she could say to the person she was saying, ‘ You can think I’m sorry because I cry.
I am angry."
And he keeps on going.
And I think it was a very good idea. ”
Tears are allowed as a way to express anger because tears are not completely understood.
One of my earliest memories, I was in this office with a number of men, where once I was found crying and inexplicably angry, was the arrest of an elderly lady - manager of a mild temper with whom I was always a little nervous - inclined urge to climb stairs.
"Don't let these people see you crying," he told me to do so.
"I don’t know you’re upset.
They think you’re sorry and are happy that they come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congress in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in their President’s campaign.
In 1987, after Hart’s adultery took aboard Monkey Businesss, which led to his leaving the race, Schroede, who was deeply disturbed, felt that there was no reason for him to take part in a contest to become a president.
"He didn't choose well," "he told me to laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven others who wanted to join the race, and the last they needed was one person.
Another called it Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was a surprise campaign, he was back on track to make money, and he was determined not to participate in the race unless he received $2 million in it.
This was a failure.
They found that some of the helpers who had donated $11,000 to men should give him only $250.
"Do they think I get rid of it?" they are surprised.
When she announced that she was not setting up a special campaign, she was deeply touched by her gratitude to the people she had helped, disappointed by the plan of things that made it difficult to obtain money and a fight against voters rather than voters, and upset for not being partial enough to cry.
"If you thought I was in serious trouble," Mrs. Schroeder remembers how the journalists treated him.
"If you had thought Keneex was my company’s assistant.
What will be put in my grave?
"He cried."
Reflecting on how China can benefit from the conflict between this country and the Americas.
At the beginning of this conflict, the struggle is still going on, but curious practitioners have found that the flu is capable of supporting China at the end of all.
The beginning of this was when the president of the American country, Donald Trump, imposed taxes on the main cargo from China as solar power, various metals, including aluminum.
This conflict seemed to have reached the crescendo in this week when the United States decreed that 200 billion dollars of goods, or another 150 billion of them, on Britain’s continent.
China has, in turn, been returning it to the United States by setting up up a tax tax on the U.S. system, recently imposed between five and ten percent of its total tax and a total of $60 billion in U.S. property.
China has declared that its style of revenge is similar to that of the United States and will pay close attention to this.
In order to stem the tide of this policy, it is necessary to cut back on China’s cheapest and attractive property and make it easy for China to yield, which would bring more reproach on its ruler, Jinpinping.
However, some experts say that the flu can provide long - term benefits to China in reducing the mutual trust between these two countries, which may occur if China has made a good choice.
"Abgail Grace, who works with the Center for New America Security, and Asian research analysts, says that "the active motivations for political reasons have an impact on the economy in the United States and China beyond the expectations of some."
Syria "will be ready" for the refugees to return, says the Foreign Minister.
Syria declared itself ready to return to their homeland and ask for help to rebuild a country that had been ravaged by the war of more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wal-Moulem said that things are beginning to improve the world.
"We’re still stable and secure because of what has happened in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to repair the damage caused by terrorist attacks to the better quality of life.
Everything is in place for the refugees to leave the country, as well as for economic reasons that have affected their daily lives and way of life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war started in 2011.
And six million others who still live in the country need help.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian Empire would receive help to rebuild this degraded land.
But they insisted that they would not receive any assistance with other needs or aid from countries that had helped the terrorist.
The European team has taken a cup of the Ryder Cup team in Paris
The European team took the Ryder Cup cup in 2018 after conquering the USA and 16 and a half-pounders in 10- and a half-in-distance of the El Gold National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has succumbed to the Ryder Cup for six consecutive years and has not even been a part of it since 1993.
A national team of athletes with Thomas Bjorn took the cup again and again after winning 14.5 to win the U.S. team.
U.S. team expert Phil Mickelson, who failed to play the game, threw a ball into an intolerable pit that led his opponent Francesco Molinori to find a winning tower.
Players from Italy have played a highly professional role in all these games, making him one of the 4 players who held 5-0 since the games in 1979.
American athletes, the Jordan Spieth did not break up when he won the 5K4 tops to European sports team Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who did not come to a true professional degree.
The world's best - known performer Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 from England’s Ian Poulter who probably plays his final game in the Ryder Cup cup.
In the Ryder Cups ’ race, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia has been the most successful athlete in Europe with 25.5 players during his career.
"I have "I don't have to cry, but I can't do it today.
That was a very difficult year for me.
I am grateful to my teacher Thomas for being alone and trusting in me.
I am so happy, and I am glad that I received this cup again.
The aim was to win our team, and I am happy that I took part in this victory," said Garcia, who looks very successful following the success of his European team.
She thanked John Ram's fellow citizens who won the US Tiger Woods 2&1 on the one-by-week games.
"I’m the most proud to win the master Tiger Woods, where I grow up and see him play," said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods won all four French games and has now won award in the Ryder Cup race, which reaches 13-2-2-3.
This is hard to conclude that this is one of the world’s experts, who has won 14 contests and is surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
USA was struggling at the end of a week to get good results except by Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played the top soccer team.
U.S. director Jim Furyk spoke after playing a game that upsets his team, "I’m proud of these boys, they’re working hard.
It was early this morning that we attacked the European team.
The war was a disaster for us.
All honor goes to Thomas.
I will give advice with my eye upon you. ”
All 12 perform with rapid success.
To do more, I am able to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will make progress.
I love all 12 friends, and I am proud to be their leader.
We can at least say that it is the right thing to do.
Let's admit that our fellows played better than we.
Most Red Seas: Less in Pinellas, Manate, and Sarasotha
A recent report from the Florida Department of Fisher and Wildlife shows a significant decrease in the growth of the Red Tide in the portion of Tampa Bay.
