You have to bring them there.
Why at home?
Asa and his father.
Do not give up.
I am new here.
I’ll try it.
We know what you are doing.
What about your father?
I know what they have to say.
Why Don’t We Go Home?
We’ll meet again!
Be quiet!
I don’t have a place to live.
You can.
Last year I gave birth to my firstborn son.
I am sure that I did.
You are a good person.
Where is your family located?
Better it is not to walk away.
I am not hungry.
I am a senior student in high school.
I lost my keys.
We are not alone.
I want you to know.
I would like to ask you, How are you benefiting from it?
No one knew what should be done.
It made me think.
I’m one of your students.
Why didn’t you speak French?
Not as you imagine.
I want to see you.
I’m glad you are there.
When Do You Rise?
Does Tom know why?
What is my hour?
We have no money.
Forgive Me!
I do not need them.
I talked to my parents about everything.
There is no other way.
I know what to do.
I know where he is.
That is fine.
Not only is it cold but it is also light - headed.
I lost my wallet.
When Do You Stand?
You can find the color on your face.
All day long it is my concern.
They have no money.
You are a good parent.
Come or Come?
I want to carry it in your hands.
Will You Make Sacrifices for the Kingdom?
I lost all sense of my head.
But if you do not, come with an impression of you.
He is my father.
I’m curious.
What does he not realize?
I don’t think he will.
I’m not sure.
They say that he is very rich.
His Word was striking.
I don’t want to cook.
Do not do that again.
No one knows him well except his parents.
I was able to do that.
I don’t think he will.
He did.
The sun is setting in the east.
Why not?
It will be very good.
There is no harm in doing so.
I remember with fondness the first time.
Do you want to take them?
Is it also called honey?
Please, separate from me.
My older brother was not at home.
My parents call me below.
What do they do here?
Do you have a brother?
See the picture.
I am confined to a wheelchair.
What are you able to do?
Is this your mother?
Why the blue sky?
If you do not, come.
That car is our home.
No one here has a car.
Choose for Us!
I do not know the meaning of that.
You know.
I’m glad you are there.
Are you?
Fortify Yourself!
What is the purpose of this test?
They don’t give me a chance.
My daughter is to be married every six months.
I know these women.
I understand what you are saying.
It makes me feel good.
Where do you know my name?
Which would you rather be?
Is This Love?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are twelve months of a year.
I have a question.
I heard that you were married.
Will You Walk or Do You?
In the past, he was a teacher.
Give it to him.
I was trembling!
Whose invitation do you think I am?
I can see that.
Would you like to see this verse for yourself?
Money is money.
Don’t be with you.
I don’t like these people.
Do you need something to drink?
Are you happy?
Absolutely!
No one listens.
I thought it was your fault.
Take a taxi to find you in a hotel.
You don’t come, do you?
Here comes that dreamer!
They will get away with it.
I don’t know how long.
Whose altar is this?
Return?
Never may that become so!
Nobody knows what needs to be done.
Do not judge.
I’ll have to ask him.
We returned.
I will examine you.
I know many things about you.
There is no harm in doing so.
I want to learn French.
My car was wrecked.
You know I love you.
I know him.
Listen!
I know what to do.
I know what is going on.
He left the keys of his car.
Why Are You Not at Home?
Can I see it again?
Do you know how to separate the sheep from the goats?
You don’t know my brother.
I will take you to school.
Do I Know Tom?
Does that sound appealing to you?
May I come back?
That is why I love you.
Are you one of them?
Sooner or later, it will likely become more heat and cold.
Please, give me a job.
For one thing, it is easy to identify with.
It is hot.
You know I love you.
The bed is simply too warm.
Our journey comes on time.
I accepted the offer.
What would you like to see?
How do you go to school?
Are You a New Partner?
I know what to do.
Do you enjoy learning?
Do you have enough money for me?
I don’t know.
I know exactly how to work.
What are sandals?
I’m glad you are there.
This book is very good.
Thank you for taking the life of our home.
I respect them.
Watch yourself!
He is vigorous in power.
This is worth five dollars.
I returned home to my mother.
You are right.
Your coat is clean.
I will protect you. ’
Thank you for making it possible for you to do just that.
Do you enjoy learning?
I will give them to you.
Let us drink at least some of them.
I seek some of them.
You are my friend.
Where Is Our Vehicle?
Nobody knows what needs to be done.
What are your classes?
You never want to know!
She is a good student.
He makes me think.
Take a book and read it.
I don’t have a home of my own.
Thank you very much.
I know you’re talking about it.
I think about it.
He is happy.
I was hungry.
I don’t know.
I don’t think so.
You must have been home.
In time, my daughter will marry.
He was raised by his grandmother.
And so on.
I want to go home.
They do not know.
I have a brother.
I made this comeback.
How long will you maintain it?
I leave at about eight o'clock in the morning.
I gave up my jewelry.
Why are they here?
What is love?
We discern.
I love this book.
Would you please read those verses?
She is my favorite wife.
I will be happy to have you.
We belong to him.
Where is your family located?
Do not say the same thing again.
Please, I’ll send you.
Where are we going?
I’m not sure.
You know where I will be.
What is the purpose of your visit?
We are happy to see them.
I know that girl.
End the car as soon as possible.
I just can’t understand.
Do you know what to do?
We know it.
No, indeed!
Where would you like to live?
I love the place to live.
Do not ask.
Should I open the door?
Take a few drops of rain.
Where are you going?
Wait while you are very happy.
You have to go home.
Is he here?
Are you learning French?
You will be more likely to repent.
I would like that.
Where Is My Vehicle?
I don’t know.
There I met my sister.
I know what I’m doing.
I gave the boy a book.
Who is your teacher?
I will do it for you.
She looks like a boy.
I don’t have a brother.
Sadly, a close friend of mine had to move to another city.
Your father?
You know I have to go.
Here is your copy.
It is not my day.
How long has he been sick?
If he had stayed home that day, it would have been safe.
Not only do they speak English but they also speak German.
I’m not happy.
I know what is going on.
I know you’re talking about it.
It’s good, isn’t it?
I know what you think.
Greed.
It wasn’t enough to turn it in, so I had to change it.
Better it is not to walk away.
She looks like a boy.
I like to watch you cook.
I have to wear my hair.
Too Little?
The owner is my brother.
I am happy and happy.
Do you have time to help me?
Give your child a chance.
I don’t know them by name.
Do You Know What It Is?
Saturday is to be a happy day.
I don’t want to die.
Tell me about your plans.
This book at a table is a good place to eat.
I lost my wallet.
Thank you for coming.
I am a cook.
Someone is standing behind the wall.
I dropped out of school.
Keep it simple.
Did you notice it?
Are they watching us?
You Are a Good Priest?
When I jumped out the hillside, it was clear to me.
Is he?
We saw it.
They are young people.
Let Nothing Deprive You of the Prize, Nov.
Don’t forget to carry a letter.
I know that he loves me.
There is a need for being on the way.
I too am going to school here.
I don’t have a brother.
I'd hit my finger too hard.
What do you see?
It is shameful.
Do you know where he is?
What about your father?
Don’t ask me again.
My father is at home.
Take a bigger picture.
The Japanese?
Offer a book.
You are a good person.
These windows close to the south.
I told them to buy bread for me.
I will walk in the day of God.
We can see.
Where do you come from?
You are on your own.
I don’t know where he lives.
Hundreds of people in a hall.
I understand them.
The owl has no teeth.
It was not.
My dream had come true.
You can.
I don’t know what to say...
Do you know where he is?
I am not a university student.
Let me see.
Are you with us?
Do good to those who hate them.
There are no exceptions.
It is too small.
Minuses do not work today.
We are so happy.
This young woman was pretty.
Come to see me.
I am not a good carpenter.
I don’t know.
Tell them what happened.
You must have been home.
I did it for you.
I love your car.
Who is your teacher?
Would You Welcome a Visit?
Does that sound appealing to you?
They should.
Undoubtedly.
Would I like to do so?
I’m not sure.
I’m glad you are there.
I need help.
I quit.
Do not resort to devious means; try to find different ways to communicate.
I don’t know what to think about.
I do not know what to do.
What motivates people to do so?
Where am I?
Do you know his name?
The money ran out.
I want to buy a car.
I want to go too.
It’s not fair.
In what time period?
We made it.
I could not believe my eyes!
I lost my keys.
I never heard this word.
I did not know if you would be present today.
I would like that.
“ You see, ” he said, “this is my house.
Your car is a good one.
They say that he is very rich.
No one can be certain.
Will You Walk or Not?
We don’t go.
In the past, there was a temple here.
I know you’re talking about it.
Oh, yes.
Why don’t you go home?
Is that how you feel?
They don’t give me a chance.
What would you like to see?
Why Do You Ask?
Here comes that dreamer!
They did not treat me like a happy son.
I believe he is very good.
Accept what you want.
I know that girl.
It was not dead.
You are a good parent.
Do You Need a automobile?
I have no money.
Do your homework.
I want to accompany you.
I only know his name.
Asa and his mother.
I will really keep fast hold of you with my right hand of righteousness.
We discern.
What is the family like?
I speak briefly in Spanish.
Next!
At what age?
I have to find out why.
You are not my brother.
My family is young.
Does Tom know why?
Is he home?
I love mathematics.
I know what to do.
There are no exceptions.
Nothing happened.
We meet one another.
Of course!
Where is Tom?
Do not be afraid.
Where did you find it?
I don’t know French.
When Do You Go?
They have no money.
Tell them what happened.
Is this phone number correct?
Resist self - blame.
It is not a horse.
Look at me!
Sooner or later, it will likely happen.
They did.
Are all travel adequate?
I did not know if you would be present today.
He nodded.
Are you with us?
It is not presumptuous to become proud.
I'm up!
I love this car.
I know where to look.
You resemble your A.
How much is enough?
They are separate.
There’s no way out!
Where would you like to live?
See.
No one really listened.
Don’t forget to carry a letter.
We are here for your sake.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
Remove your shoes from behind.
They know us.
When Do You Stand?
I will not give up.
From Britain.
Please, separate from me.
Let me explain.
Windows opened.
You do not have to come.
No one listens.
I never forgot it.
I don’t think he will.
There is no harm in doing so.
Coins are considered here.
I know they are.
Nobody asked for it.
They want us to do that.
What do you see outside?
I hope you will be happy too.
I won’t be there.
Where is Tom?
What is French?
The owner of the literature was my sister.
We may even go to work this day.
We arrived.
I am learning French at home.
Thank you for listening.
I know where they go.
It is a remarkable book.
Our equipment is fat.
I know your father.
“ I am learning French in school.
“ You have to go home.
Where have all the people gone?
Can You Open the window?
Will you be a part of this future?
Where is my mother?
If not now, when?
What do you look for?
Where Is Your Vehicle?
My father was away.
There is no question about it.
Do you know what it is?
I am not alone.
Are you looking for them here?
No rich man lived here.
In this case, however, it was worth it.
You know him.
I would love to see her.
My father was away.
Of course not!
What’s Wrong With This Phone?
You can sing.
I’m so sorry!
I know how to do it very well.
We are not hungry.
I thought you could understand them.
Where are we now?
Love ceases to exist.
Let me send it to you.
I know you’re right.
I am not a student.
I’ll try it.
The wind blows fast, and I can no longer move about as fast as I can.
You don’t seem to like it.
There my sister was.
I don’t give up.
How much time will it be for you?
Asa and his Father.
What is that?
You’re right.
My house of worship is adjacent to the church building.
He was betrayed!
All the water that falls down to the ground will be eaten by swine.
I couldn’t look.
I don’t want to read them.
No one knows his name.
Do you know where they were?
Where do you go to school?
Where?
What a thought!
She gave it to me.
I never saw him.
Where is he?
He listens to us.
Why do people say that?
The date palm is very important.
I have sworn.
I don’t know French.
No one!
Why do I have to do it?
Saturday.
So I did that.
I am a cook.
How many?
We do not have the money.
I know that you listen to me.
“ Remove your sandals from off you.
I know what it is like to be a part of it.
I am happy.
A new car?
Why not?
He did not read the book to himself.
I do not want to be rich.
Please forgive me for saying that.
An ant does not have teeth.
This will be a cause for rejoicing.
You can attend.
When Do You Come Home?
He did not read the book to himself.
You have to get up.
We love you.
This book is a new book.
You know him.
He is a Frenchman.
I don’t have a car.
Focus on your head.
Why not make it your aim to think of more clearly what you have in mind?
I want you to see her again.
You can use the car.
No, I don’t.
He is a teacher.
I love him.
I am not a student.
Would you like to see this?
Think of it!
I love you.
He came alone.
I bought her and her mother's milk.
One piece of paper was lost.
I saw her again.
Is this your mother?
We grew up together.
What was your purpose?
Are you looking for us?
I’ll be in my car.
I don’t like running.
He is a Frenchman.
He is a tall boy.
I know exactly how they look.
You know how to do it very well.
I have a car.
When Will You Come to Your Home?
In the evening, between 7: 00 a.m. and 8: 00 a.m., it is joyful.
You do not have to come.
You have to stop drinking.
Be caring for your mother.
There is a need for being on the way.
Where did you get your car stopped?
I can't wait between one hour and two hour.
Have your say in your mouth, and kill it.
What should I wear or be put on?
What is the book?
The Americas?
What do they look like?
Look at me!
I’m reading a book.
Read!
I don’t know.
It is not as you think.
Would You Welcome a Visit?
Which are your belongings?
How widespread is error?
We drink.
Here comes that dreamer!
Never Too Late to Serve God
I will step on such.
We are happy for them.
Keep cool and quiet.
It doesn’t show respect to me.
I take them with me.
I am not hungry.
I understand.
Not necessarily.
“ I am learning French in school.
Why?
I want to go home.
Asa and his mother.
Will You Look for Me?
Greet your mother.
You know I have to go.
Which automobile is that?
Do you love him?
We must place a limit between exit and logs.
The snake jumps on the scaffold.
They are not coming today.
Do You Know What You Need?
Open the window!
Here’s our home!
The son is his brother.
Why Not at School?
Why don’t we go home?
Can I go in?
You know I love you.
Researchers have found out of human bones in a cave.
Our journey depends on time.
Can I see it again?
These steps can prevent the spread of the needle’s eye from slipping further away.
It’s a factory.
We are told to eat a meal together.
Do not be angry!
It is not a dialogue. We'll only go to a movie.
I loved him.
Why don’t we go home?
Get out of my room!
I am new here.
I want to learn French.
I will come and collect you.
I don’t have a sister.
I don’t sleep on the floor.
I have a purse.
The water is gone.
I wish I had let go.
I talk about what I think.
What Is the Cost?
I know where we are.
Why not?
I am going to get my car.
Why are you not in class?
“ We are in the university class.
I do not know his name.
I’ll have a good night’s sleep.
How do you go to school?
Forgive Me!
Let me explain.
Don’t tell me!
Do you know what it is?
Please forgive me for saying that.
I know her family.
I know.
I lost my keys.
I accept that.
They don’t give me a chance.
What is the reason for your trip?
Why not?
She does not speak English.
The next day, I was pregnant.
Well, you don’t?
We know him.
I want a little relaxation.
Nobody asked for it.
We are not hungry.
I was devastated.
I talked to my parents about everything.
I get up at five o’clock in the morning.
Do not open a window.
Well, consider.
Why Are You Not Here?
Why So Much heat?
All day long, he is at work except for a rainy day.
We belong to him.
Do not look below.
How does she feel about her brother?
Can we settle our differences amicably?
Where are we taking us?
I liked that car.
Why learn French?
I think so.
I’ve seen them.
I know you’re right.
He accused the man of stealing.
I worked on this jacket while I lugged.
I’m not sure.
I do not know their names.
I’ll agree with your plan.
I know what to do.
They say that he is very rich.
Your coat is clean.
In Germany, are they not?
Do you love it?
"These trucks are common?" – "Yes is my Father."
You do not need to thank me.
What happened to you the night before?
We want them to succeed.
Asa and his mother.
Since we are alone, let us enjoy each other’s company.
We have come to see you.
Which would you rather be?
It’s not my car.
I do not know his name.
Do you need something to drink?
Do you not know what happened, or what happened?
I know what love is.
Not at all.
A tutor needs to die.
What do you do here?
It’s a factory.
No one prepared me.
We attended one class.
Where?
It made me think.
Do you have sugar?
Is he here?
We meet.
We’re our siblings.
I know why you are here.
Why did you study at a university?
Where is he?
Sooner or later, it will likely happen.
When Will You Come Home?
I lost my hand.
Yes.
You’re hearing your mother!
Read.
I will give them to you.
What news?
They come to my room!
This teaspoon — Will It Survive?
Do you need something to drink?
I am the youngest.
How much is enough?
I would like to read this book.
From Brazil.
I’m going to take you home.
We attended one class.
Do not forget us!
I’ll write about it for us.
Do not give in to frustration.
Do you have this money?
Not too little.
It is his work.
That is what you have asked.
She’s my sister.
What are you looking for?
Be Guided by the Living God, 6 / 15
He did.
I want to see.
Stop setting rules!
Sometimes we went to the cinema.
You are right here, aren’t you?
Have you read the book from beginning to end?
When?
Why do we do that?
This is extremely long.
Do you believe that it does not matter to me?
There are cats in the sheepfolds.
She’s my sister.
It is his work.
Do you know what they said?
I’m not sure.
They do not know.
The United States?
A cup or a cup of tea?
What was at the bottom of the list?
I am sorry that I turned out to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
We are alone.
I love what I am doing.
My voice is dirty because of my tongue.
Do you know what he said?
His words were clear.
When do you want to go?
I don't understand such things.
Is this the best?
Do they in Japan?
I’ll try.
Does he know that you love him?
We are wasting valuable time.
Why not quit?
Make an appropriate session talk in other languages.
Where is his family now?
Magdalena and Anita are good friends.
I am happy and happy.
We should eat together during the day.
Take one step at a time.
Do you have a brother or a sister?
We got together.
I’ll agree with that.
I have to think about it.
Where is Mary?
I was paralyzed.
I have to finish.
I’m glad you are there.
Do you think I’m happy?
Why didn’t you come with me?
No one is at home.
Well, I say so.
He loved her.
She did not become pregnant.
Why Don’t They Love Me?
How Much Is a Parent?
What Did You Give Me?
Go out.
Tom is a carpenter.
I am not a wealthy man.
His face is intense; the brow is furrowed in concentration.
It was not.
Return!
I’ll take part in that.
How many nights?
We will be able to do so.
I was greeted by people with warm, friendly smiling faces.
You have to leave.
Asa and his Father.
You are instructed to go with me.
Do you know where he is?
I was not happy.
Why not accompany me?
Give me your hour.
Do you have your savings?
This is a very effective tool.
You must have been home.
I don’t have a brother.
I don’t know.
I don’t know how to keep it.
Can You Answer?
I do it.
Do you know these people?
Is this the right one?
Why do I do it?
I will not be offended.
This industry makes vehicles.
I am not a student.
Yes, we do.
Do not do that again.
See in window.
I was not happy.
One piece of paper was lost.
Take money.
He is happy.
Driven by traffic.
Would you like to know why?
Would you like to examine that topic and see?
Remember your kindness and show it to others.
I am the youngest.
What do you think?
We thoroughly enjoyed the day - to - day talks in the language.
So you have brought me here.
I’m not sure.
I did.
No one said a word.
We’re our siblings.
It is hot.
So I did that.
I have to learn.
Thank you very much!
Yes.
Does that sound appealing to you?
He is our neighbor.
What was that purpose?
I don't have any other neighbor.
“ We are in the university class.
It is not something new.
Do You Come, or Do You?
Can you repeat what you have said?
No one could see anything.
I’ll try.
I want to ask you, are you left out?
I know that girl.
What kind of books do you like to read?
He needs water.
Where are you taken?
There is no harm in doing so.
It makes me feel good.
How many drinks did you drink?
How extensive are these offices?
This car is a success.
We hear it.
Our equipment was exhausted.
We shall see.
Your personal information?
I know you’re right.
“ Please forgive me, ” I replied.
Children too.
He is a teacher.
We ascended a path that took us to the brow of a hill.
I can’t remember any names.
Do you want to be rich?
I would like to read this book.
I never lie.
I am a university student.
We have these publications.
They do not want us to know.
It’s not my car.
You've got a red light sign.
I know what I’ve been told.
I miss you very much.
I understand what you are saying.
I want you to stay.
Together we walk.
Give the occasion a chance.
I am not good enough.
No one!
It is not a matter of his making calls in a mechanical or perfunctory way.
Do you understand French?
He makes me think.
For one thing, it is easy to identify with.
What is this wine?
I have a brother.
They don’t have much time to spare.
If you need help, call me.
I too.
We turned away.
Here no one has a monopoly on getting rich.
Why does he want to get there?
You’re hearing your mother!
I love mathematics.
Here comes that dreamer!
We all go there together.
Next week.
I like to watch your cooking.
What do you do?
I shall lack nothing.
Are they also coming?
You know that we love you.
You can separate the sheep from the goats.
I’ll have to think about that.
No one really listened.
I love learning French.
We can enter the sea coast this seventh edge.
Why?
You don’t come, do you?
You have to leave.
How old is he?
I know.
Never Too Late to Serve God
She is no longer happy.
I know where to look.
Unless the rain fails, you will have to work every day.
Thank you very much!
I do not want to.
What was at the bottom of the list?
