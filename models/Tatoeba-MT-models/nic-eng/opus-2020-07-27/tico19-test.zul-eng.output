The event of the rapid growth of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
A growing event of the conditions of Coronavirus (COVID-19) shows the same rates in European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom to ensure that, although in separate positions of the world, the accident of COVID-19 is going on rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and emergency - care units should increase the willingness to accept many COVID - 19 patients who will need health care, and especially the care of those in crisis.
In 31 December 2019, a group of people with unexploded variabilitys of aerosols were reported at Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of a new coronavirus is now known as the sere acate respiration syndrome cryonic 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the resulting illness of SARS-COV-2 has been named coronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence thus far indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 are suffering from some minor ailment, that is to say a respiratory disease that is associated with or does not relate to pneumonia, and most of these people are recovering.
In 14%, COVID-19 is developing into a very serious illness that requires hospitalization while 6% of the remaining cases face a serious condition requiring attention.
The deaths of victims of cryptics due to COVID-19 are 4%.
In this study, we are studying the accounts of the development of COVID-19 in each European Union/ European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and associated them with those in the Hubei Province, China.
It also compares the current number of people with COVID-19 in the EU/EA and UK and that of Italy during January1,–15 March 2020.
COVID 19 in the EU/EA and UK
After China, COVID-19 was widely spread in areas and the change of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide is currently following what is happening in the country.
On 11 March 2020, the General director of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is a epidemic.
The 5 March of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spipiri et al. It reported the first confirmed COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with WHO's definition.
In the EU/EA, the first guaranteed people are reported by France on January 24, 2020 of the people who came from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On March 15, 2020, COVID-19 were found in all 30 countries of EU/EA and the United Kingdom (UK), that is, between 31 December 2019 that day, 39,768 persons with 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750 infected with the virus and 1,441 dead were confined to Italy only.
Finding an increasing and growing number of cases of COVID-19
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (IECDC), figures of people with COVID-19 in each country worldwide, obtained only by legal resources such as the World Health Organization, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are returned each day by 8:00 a.m.
This date was used to analyze the COVID-19 EU/EA and UC, and compared with those in Italy.
As a representative of the presence of the ongoing features of COVID-19, it calculates an enlarged event of 14 days of COVID-19, thus considering the natural progress of COVID-19, in each country of the EU/EA and UK, during the January 1–15 March 2020.
We also introduce a growing number of reported national events on 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared with Italy at 31 January–15 March 2020.
In the EU/EA and UK
In the EU/EA and UK will usually follow those of the Hubei Province (China).
In all of the EU/EEA and the UK, the growing event of the COVID-19 began to rise on about 21 February and rejoiced at 28 February 2020.
This is greatly increased by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EA and UK countries show the same high rates of the growing event of COVID-19 (Reading Aid).
The image 2 shows the increasing number of conditions of COVID-19, in the EU/EA and UK countries compared with that of Italy during January 31,–15 March 2020.
Significantly, on 15 March 8:00 a.m., some 15 countries of the EU/EA and UK had already reported a total of less than three weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of reported conditions of COVID-19 is rising rapidly in the EU/EA and UK.
The costs mentioned in the growing event of COVID-19 show that the epidemic is continuing at the same rate in all countries.
This is true despite the fact that the nations are in different roles, varied in the health response of the community, and probably different definitions of conditions in countries as well as various protocol programs to select patients to ensure a COVID-19, which includes a follow-up test.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian states described the situation when 10% of COVID - 19 patients needed attention and the media reported that hospitals and emergency units in the provinces had reached their peak.
The data for the transfer of COVID-19 to a hospital and/or emergency unit is found in the EU/EA section only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (dadata not shown).
It should, however, be gathered in an orderly way to correspond to the present date of awareness that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a great difference in the availability of emergency beds and of central medical care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in a population of 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 emergency and central care beds for 100,000 people by 2010–11).
To mimic conditions related to the increasing level of health care, which provides an average of each EU/EEA and UK for the increase of conditions in the hospital due to COVID-19% of the risk of passing the number of emergency beds, is provided in the sixth return of an ECDC scan of an emergency accident in terms of COVID-19.
As conditions are accumulated in certain areas in the EU/EA and UK countries, and emergency hospitals and units usually assist some readers, knowledge about the situations and care beds should be available at the extent of the Nonmediatial Integration of statistics 2 (UNTS-2).
The experiences from Italy and the current international districts show that the COVID-19 epidemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EA and the UK.
The countries, hospitals and units of care should arrange for the ongoing interaction of SARS-COV-2 administrators as well as the increase of COVID-19 patients who need medical attention, and especially critical care, such as that in the areas affected in Italy.
As shown in a recent study of the ECDC of an emergency, a quick, active, and thorough method is important to delay the progress of SARS-COV-2, by means of change from control mode to a reduced course, since the expected rapid increase in the number of conditions may not enable the DOs and hospitals enough time to understand, of accepting and adapt their responses to the appropriate way if they are not used in time.
An early examination of an accident also refers to public health measures to control the effect of the epidemic.
There is a small gap in which the nations are unable to have continued control of their control efforts in order to reduce the progress of SARS-CV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
The failure of this, perhaps to treat some EU/EA countries will face a host of patients who need attention in the days or weeks to come.
The outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the sere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CV-2), currently killing more than 3,000 people and treating more than 880,000 people in China and other parts of the world, which has been successful in human disasters.
Like its same virus, SARS-CV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CV-2 may also be passed from bats and cause similar symptoms.
The COVID-19, however, has a more serious risk and death rate than SARS but is more widely passed and is treating more adults than are younger and more male than women.
As a response to the rapidly growing number of published articles on the young disease, the article is trying to provide a time - and - depth return on the subject of rapid research.
We will discuss the basic things concerning epidemiology, biology,ology, diagnosis, treatment, cause, and prevention of disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this return helps to understand and eliminate the threat of an epidemic.
The January 25, 2020, Spring Festival has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who are encouraged to stay in their homes on vacation and in many weeks thereafter because of the outbreak of new virus.
The virus is much like the coronavirus (COV) that caused the explosion of a sere respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and a related disease was called COV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world and about 50 others around the world.
On March 2, 2020, the virus led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients released from the hospital and more than 3,000 patients who died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "a leading public enemy" and may be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https:/www.c.nlm.nig.nov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 pages are printed regarding COVID-19 which includes itsvidology, epidemiology, eitology, tests, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020.
This revision tries to slow down the progress of research on a new and rapid development article.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another illness caused by COV, Middle East respiration syndrome (MERRS, a 2012 outbreak).
We will also consider what we have learned so far about prevention and the causes of disease and other yet more important questions.
CVs that are generally viewed as non-inflammatory to humans, mainly responsible for 15% of the common colds 4.
In this century, however, we have had two major cases with the COVs, namely, SARS-COV and MERS-CV, which caused the epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, in sequence, and soon spread to other countries that caused serious illness and death.
Therefore, the present COVID-19 is the third strike of the CV in the written history of the people.
As shown in Death. As.1,1.1, genies with unknown origin began to be reported at Wuhan on December 31, 2019 in China’s National Health Commission.
Seven days later the succession of the CV was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death event was reported in Wuhan.
In the meantime, the plague spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, a combination of health workers was reported, suggesting that interpersonal interaction was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was reduced and all public transport supplies were established.
On January 24 the first medical study of disease reported that, of the 41 patients whose condition is confirmed, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan food market that was regarded as the first disease from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO announced the outbreak of a global health emergency.
By the time of the report, the disease has spread throughout China and in about 50 countries around the world (Death.2).
As the situation deteriorates rapidly, the outcome and tragedy of the epidemic are not known.
On February 11, 2020, a study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 who were assured that they were suffering from COVID-19 showed a more redefined picture of the epidemic in the following way (https://m.wikixin.q.com/s/UlBI-HX_HPPHA1qHA2bdA).
SARS-COV-2 has been ill for people of all ages, but it is primarily 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of the patients were over 50 years old, fewer than 20, and only 14 patients were less than 10.
The SARS-COV-2 has caused more males (0.1/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The COVID-19 grew in major groups in Hubei and nearby.
The COVID-19 took an average of 5 days (2-9) from the beginning to the test.
The average duration of the impalement period is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The time limit is from the beginning to the death of 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic removable number (R0) was 3.77 (95% C: 3.51-4.555), and the modified R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people involved rose rapidly before 23 Jan. 2020, which was comparable to the time of a greater transfer before the Spring Festival in China.
The death of confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.1.86%), and the changed death rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 were sex (men), age (%0260), and critical pneumonia.
COVs are part of a family of large hidden viruses containing one RNA nerve fibers.
It can be divided into four parts, namely Alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, that is, Alpha, and beta are not known to infect people.
The Spike (S) of the glycoprotein package adheres to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and inputdyyl perptile 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CV and MERS-CV, respectively, then the joining of membranes.
The RNA gene is released from Cytoplansm; after a duplicate of the gene, RNA of a gene associated with the shell of glycoprotein and nuclecapsid proteins form synonys, which include a plasma membrane to release the virus.
The sequence of original SARS-CV-2 genes was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-COV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CV with 99.98% of the ten successive samples gathered at the first stage of the attack, the Huanaan Seated Market in Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is usually much more similar to SARS-CV than MERS-CV.
Using electronic transmission microscope, SARS-CV-2 crystals were found in the most visible parts of the epithelium airway.
The ACE2 people were found to be the SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CV.
However, S S S-COV-2 protocol includes a human ACE2 much faster than that of SARS-CV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CV-2 causes less serious infections to patients than SARS-COV.
The SARS-COV-2 can also build a new short protein produced by the orf3b and the output protein produced by the orf8.
The SAR3b of SARS-CV-2 may play a role in the bug-pounderity and may prevent the appearance of IFNNAME; however, an orf8 does not contain any background or common operating mode.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the construction of aclo-EM of persons with a full height of 2.9 Å corresponds with amino acid vehicle B0AT1.
It was found that these links, with open and closed buildings, were joined as a dier and the ACE2-B0AT1 inter-connected are able to combine two S proteins, which provide evidence of the sight of the CV and input.
B00AT1 may be a medical unit in deforestation to suppress the SARS-CV-2 input.
Root and centre layer
It is known that both SARS-CV and MERS-COV began in bats and passed on to the people with civet cats and lawyers, one after another.
By comparison of SARS-CV-2 and other COVs, bats are recognized as the origin of SARS-CV-2 as the new virus equals 96% with two SARS like SL-CVX45 bats and SL-CVZX2-CVZX1.
However, which team stepped in to help the virus cross the line between creatures so that it could enter unknown humans, and the transmission line will still be clearly identified.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes may have been carrying infection from bats to humans that involved a combination of the same factors within S.
According to research, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggest that pangolins - with long noses, ants that are commonly used as traditional Chinese medicine — it may be the central environment of SARS-CV-2 based based on 99% of the COV products derived from pargolin and SARS-CV-2.
However, the 1% variation that is spread between two genes makes a big difference; therefore, the assured effects of strong femininity are preserved (Death.33).
SARS-CV-2 chemical elements are currently unknown.
The SARS-CV and the MERS-Ccomp may live without a creature for 48 hours in a dry area and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%-50%.
The SAFS-COV-2 may have similar features.
It is reported that SARS-CV-2 does not respond to ultraviolet radiation and 56 degrees Fahrenheit (56 ° C); ether, 75% of ethanol, chlorinic bacteria, paracetic acid, chloroform, and other solvents, but not chlorophydine, can cause the virus to become effective.
All too often the lack of immune defenses against SARS-COV-2 and therefore are in danger of getting a new virus.
At present, no detailed research has been reported on the reactions of the immune system to SARS-COV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to past studies of other COVs, particularly SARS-COV and MERS-CV (Death.4).
Usually, after the virus attacks the body, it is first identified by the natural receptors of the immune system (PRR) that include cictators such as C c crectins, receptorlike Tll (TLR), a receptorlike receptor (NLR), and a receptorlike RIG (RR).
By different methods, the virus causes the display of decompositions, the development of decomposing cells, and the production of interferrons I (IFNs) that interfere with the spread of the virus and speed up the macrophage phagocytosis of the infected antigens.
However, N N N'S-CV protocol may help the virus to escape immune reactions.
In the near future, the immune system’s flexible responses join in the battle against the virus.
T lymphocytes that include DD4+ and CD8+ cells play an important role in protecting.
CD4+ T cells encourage B cells to produce antiviral antibodies, as well as CD8+ cells that directly kill infected cells.
The helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CV can prevent T cell operation by producing an apoptosis of T cells.
Incompetence inhumral as well as such aids as C3a and C5a and the immune system are also important in fighting infection.
For example, the immune system derived from a recovering patient renders MERS-CV useless.
On the other hand, oversight of antibodies creates a large number of medical treatments in a area that is capable of causing serious injury to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst of all, the failure of many organs and even death.
SARS-CV-2, which has a primary factor as a group, has many chances of treating adult ovarians and pregnant women.
It is not uncommon for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have the ability to react to dangerous immune systems have a higher chance of joining themselves than other people.
The proportion of the cause of the period of SARS-COV-2 is 1-14 days, most times 3-7 days based on the study of the first 425 persons in Wuhan.
However, a survey of 1,099 people shows that the period of irrigation was 3 days on an average and had an average length of 0 to 24 days.
Recent research, as described above, indicated that the dating period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on the knowledge of 8,866 people.
It is very important for health authorities to change the time of a curfew based on the correct dating period, with the eardrum blocking of people who have no signs of transmitting the virus to others.
As is the custom, people who are exposed, or infected, need to be locked up for 14 days.
Should the closing time be extended to 24 days?
The fever is usually the first major symptom of COVID-19, which may be incompatible with symptoms or other symptoms such as no coughs, no breath loss, muscle pain, sore throat, sore throat, sore throat, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia within a week after the onset of the disease.
In critical cases, patients progressed rapidly and developed serious respiratory infections, septic shock, metatabolic acidis, and cogengapathy.
Patients with fever as well as respiratory and serious fever symptoms, even if there are no unusual symptoms seen in the lung image, should be sorted for early tests.
A public information study conducted at the end of December 1920 showed the percentage of symptoms that were 98% of fever, 76% of gonorrhea, 55% of dyspnea, and 3% of diarrhea; 8% needed to breathe with an electronic aid.
Similar findings were reported on in two recent studies of family groups as well as a group based on the role of a person who has no symptoms.
By comparison, a study of human information in 2012 showed that MERS-CV patients also had fever (98%), non-financial cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their primary symptoms.
However, 80% of them had to breathe with the aid of a machine, much more than with COVID-19 patients and in accordance with the highest rate of MERS's murder than the COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and pain throat (21%) were also noted for MERS patients.
For SARS patients, it was shown that fever (99-100%), no cough (29-75%), dyspnea (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were major symptoms and breathing with mechanical aid was required by about 14%-20%.
On February 14, the deaths caused by COVID-19 were 2% in which the confirmed patients reached 56,576 worldwide.
By comparison, the deaths caused by SARS in November 2002 were 10% of all diagnosed cases.
In the MERS, based on public information research in June 2012, the death rate was 37% for 2,494 patients who were assured.
The first survey reported that the R0 of SARS-COV-2 was high by 6.47 had a 95-% security gap (CI) of 5.71-7.23, where SARS-CV was a population from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV concerning their symptoms, death, and R0 is represented as Table1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-COV-2 have a much higher capacity of ERS-CV and SARS-CV, but is less lethal than both.
Therefore, it is far more difficult to control the SARS-CV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CV and SARS-CV.
Groups are often formed at the same family or at the same social gathering or transportation services, such as a boat.
Patients usually have a history of visiting or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with a close or sick person two weeks later.
It has been reported, however, that people can carry the virus without symptoms for as long as two weeks and that hospital - operated patients can also carry the virus again, giving warning to increase the duration of the silence.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells of peripheral (especially lymphocytes) in earlier stages.
For example, lymphopiania has the number of white blood cells < 4×109/L that includes the number of lymphocyte < 1×109/L, as well as high levels of aspate amentransphere and Viremia found in 1,099 cases of COVID-19.
The levels of liver and liver enzymes and myoglobin were high in the blood of other patients, and C-reacticive protein and erthrocyte code were high in the blood of many patients.
For seriously ill patients, D-dmer’s level, the result of the loss of the fibr present in the blood, was higher, and the rate of lymphocyte was drastically reduced.
An unusual discovery was found in the cardiography of many patients with COVID-19 and with two-pounders or grouped glass in the lungs.
Patients often suffer from unusual pneumonia, serious lung damage, and acupunctory stress syndrome (ARDS).
In the case of ADDS, unsupervised inflammation, the growth of liquids, and the increasing fibrosis are putting the gas in jeopardy.
Poor performance of the I and the I-type of pneumocyte reduces the rate of surfactant and increases the stress of the upper area, thus reducing the lung capacity for expansion and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the worst side effects of radioography are often similar to the most serious condition of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first mathematical analysis of COVID-19 showed the frequency of pneumocytes, the formation of the hyaline membrane, and the achievement of interstitial lymphocyte, as well as the metaphysic cells in the patient's lungs, which accompany the disease - STD therapy and similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
The discovery of SARS-CV-2 using reverse-transscriptase polymerase (RT-PCR) was used as a major test subject for COVID-19.
However, because of the high number of non-productive poisons, which could cause the epidemic, medical observations began to be used when testing (not only RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation arose when an SARS test took place.
Therefore, a combination of the history of disease, medical evidences, laboratory examinations, and radiation effects is important and vital for a successful diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Fung Zhang team explained the program for using SERLOCK based on the SARS-COV-2 system to locate SARS-2, receiving non-RNA non-COV-2 natural parts in 20 × 10-18 mol/20 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies for each installed frames) being used in time without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that a new approach will greatly improve empathy and benefit if assured of medical samples.
Because of a lack of experience with the new COV, doctors can primarily provide support care for COVID - 19 patients, while attempting a variety of used or previously developed treatments to treat some COVs-CV like SARS-CV and MERS-CV and other infectious diseases (Ithalala2).2).
These include current and possible antimicrobial therapy, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from patients, Chinese medicine, and mental aid.
It is even recommended that the blood plasma of patients be used as a treatment.
The pharmaceutical firms compete to form a defense against infection.
SARS-CV-2 mainly attack the lungs at first and probably again, on a small scale, other body parts that show ACE2, such as a gastrinthintal tumor and the kidneys.
Nevertheless, poor performance and lack of breathing are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Therefore, the support of breathing is essential in order to treat symptoms and save health and include normal oxygen therapy, elevated oxygen flows, air replacements without body damage, and air installations using the equipment that harm the body with the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be based on the use of exracorporial membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), an improved surgical procedure used to treat a life - threatening heart or breathing disorder.
Moreover, keeping in balance of the electronic license, prevention and treatment of second input and septic shock, as well as prevention of vital organs is also important to patients with SARS-CV-2.
It is known that the cytokine storm is the result of an extreme reaction of antibodies to SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine is the reaction of the cytone program with the characteristics of the release of a series of cytokines, including TNF, IL-1-2, IL-6, IFN, FN, FN, FN, FN, and MCP1.
These cytokines encourage the immune system to release large numbers and free medical agents, which are the primary cause of ADDS and the failure of most organs.
The stress of the immune system is important in the treatment of cytokines, especially for serious patients.
Corticosteroids and toyrizumab, anti-IL6 monoclons, have been used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other therapy for the immune system of Cytokine involves the control of body antibodies directed in the T cell; the prevention of IFN- guard, IL1, and TNF; the recognition of JAK; the name of the JANK; the llinatumab; the pressure for the use of cytokin; and HDAC's steel glands.
steroids, such as immunosuppressants, are widely used for SARS therapy to reduce the risk of inflammation.
However, steroids in high levels have not benefited from serious lung damage for SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Rather, it may cause unpleasant side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which is significantly disrupting prognosis.
Nevertheless, a short program of corticosteroids at lower rates to moderate levels has been recommended to be used carefully for COVID-19 ill patients who are seriously ill.
By the time of writing, no effective treatment against infection had been established.
However, reimdesis, nucleotide analog, was found to be effective for an American patient with COVID-19.
The Remdesir is a new antibiotic that was first developed by Gilead to cure viruses in Ebola and Marlburg.
Later, the reimsir also showed that it could prevent the viruses in the RNA that include MERS and SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead has provided the Chinese element to conduct research for SARS-CV-2 people, and the results are considered seriously.
In addition, baritritenb, interferron-euter,lopinavir/ritonavir, and rubin have been raised as possible treatment for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious reactions may occur after a combination oflopinavir/ritonavir.
The connection between this treatment and other drugs used in patients should be considered carefully.
Plasma from recovered patients and the development of immune systems.
The collection of blood for recovering patients to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy ones from infection rather than long history.
In fact, recovering patients often have a higher level of antibodies that fight the disease in their blood.
The immune system is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes in order to fight diseases and other nonbody factors and can detect different cells in the disease and cause them to become totally inactive.
Based on this, plasma was collected in the blood of a group of patients who were recovered from COVID-19 and was administered to 10 patients in a critical manner.
Their symptoms were improved in 24 hours, with reduced swellings and levels of infection as well as improved oxygen levels.
However, reassurances and clarifications are needed in order to make a widely used application before any treatment is developed.
In addition, when considering the effects of treatment, some of the side effects associated with plasma should be considered seriously.
The immune system, for example, can extremely promote immune reactions and cause cytokine’s release, which may be life - threatening risks.
The amount of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma is great if patients can be treated in a critical manner.
It is very difficult to build and produce certain antibodies as soon as possible for a global epidemic.
As a result, it is very important and reasonable to distinguish the B cells of recovered patients and to identify genetic codes with active genes or to select the body’s antibodies that are active in representing the important components of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the combination of many parts in various forms according to the diagnosis based on TCM vision.
Most of the working parts remain unknown or undetectable since it is difficult to pick up and confirm such active parts or combinations.
In the meantime, because of the lack of effective and precise medical care of COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major forms of treating patients with minor symptoms to the middle of those who are recovering in critical stages.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du tablets as well as the Lian Hua Qing Wen have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
High rates of treatment for COVID-19 were noted in many Chinese states using TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei state, using TCM, about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had a lower level of recovery rate (13%).
This, however, is an unfavorable comparison as other factors such as the number and importance of patients should be included in a review.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and her colleagues published a study of comparing Western medicine (WM) alone with WM and a combination of WM and TCM.
They found that the times needed for the body temperature to heal, stop symptoms, and hospitalization were short for the WM+TCM group with only a WM group.
More interesting, that the risk of symptoms (from small to serious) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group (7.4% compared with 46.2%) and death was less than the WM+TCM group (8.8% compared with 39%).
Nevertheless, TCM safety still awaits well - managed research at large levels and centers.
It can also be impressed that the course of action is noted and made clear that the active parts of TCM treatment or combinations are possible.
Patients with suspects or assured that they are suffering from COVID-19 often have a serious fear of a highly contagious and deadly disease, and people who are confined to them again are homoking, lonely, and aggressive.
Furthermore, symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and coughing and the adverse effects of sleep - related sleep therapy can lead to increased anxiety and mental depression.
In the first phase of the SARS revolution, many mental - health - related illnesses that include persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, stroke, stroke, mood disorders, psychiatric disorders, and even suicide are reported.
A series of heavy connections and closings, as part of public health response to the outbreak of COVID-19, may cause many people to become anxious and guilty about the consequences of involvement, closing, and burial in the family and friends.
As a result, mental health care should be given to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having it, people connected with them, and the general public.
Psychologists should include the development of mental health centers for many areas, clear, regular and accurate communication with regard to SARS-CV-2 revolutions and treatment programs as well as the use of electric drills and procedures to avoid close contact with others.
Practical goals are essential in order to break the chain of contact between animals and humans involved and potential visitors and are often in line with treatment for antibiotics against new viral infections.
Efforts have been made to achieve goals based on S S Proto-projects to create long and effective anti-invasive antibodies and/or anti-SARS-CV.
Control - powered goals have been studied in animals in connection with SARS.
However, the function of living things is still to be discovered before medical research is started.
This is because the SARS has remained silent 17 years ago and no new illness has been reported since then.
On the other hand, the rare conditions and groups of MERS continue to rise from the Middle East and spread in other areas as a result of the persistence of biological sources from animals to people in sick areas.
MERS have been developed by the use of an inactive virus, DNA plasma, microfacterial velocity, nanoparticle, microorganic crystals, microorganins, and subdivision units and others have been tested in animal models.
The building of a safe and effective goal against SARS-CV-2 in the participants is an urgent and important task in controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to withstand the difficulties because of the long period (an average of 18 months) required for the development of the goal and the different types of CVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to show its full medical program for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can be able to recover gradually without the consequences of a previous disease.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a higher rate of sickness and death among patients with serious illnesses.
Therefore, designing a model of the cause of the disease is essential to health care services for establishing its screens, especially in areas with small help.
Based on reported medical research until now, the following factors may affect or be linked to the cause of COVID-19 (The Table) patients (The Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the SARS cause, which is also true of COVID-19.
The COVID-19 appeared primarily in the age of 30-65 and 47.7% of those patients were more than 50 in a survey of 8,866 patients as described above.
Patients who needed attention for serious conditions had a higher chance of treating other diseases and complexities and were significantly older than those without them (66 ages compared with 51), suggesting that age is a factor in the effect of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CV-2 has caused more male disease than women (00.31/100,000 compared with 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Already existing and complex diseases: COVID - 19 patients who need serious care have a high risk of serious heart injury and arthrhythmia.
Heart - related events were also a major cause of the death of SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-COV-2 is also able to adhere to ACE2- post-box cholaocyte, which may lead to liver failure for COVID-19 patients.
It is good to note that age and existing disease are closely related and may be confusing.
The effects of an unusual laboratory: The level of C-reative protein in the blood (CRP) indicates the difficulty of inflammation or damage of tissue and has been raised to be a potential cause of illness, response to treatment, and complete recovery.
Further contact with the CRP level and the risk of COVID-19.
In addition, high lactate dehydrogenese (LDH), aspartate aminotransphere (AST), Alaniine ammoninine amnotransferase (ALT), and creatine chinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely displayed in many parts, especially in heart and liver, and are released during muscle damage.
As a result, they are common signs of heart failure or boldness.
Major medical symptoms: chest radioography and short-term treatment symptoms should be considered along with other possible side effects and complications of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As described above, immunosuppressant steroids are often used as a alternative treatment for infectious diseases in order to reduce the risk of inflammation.
With a high number of corticosteroids applied to patients with critical SARS, most of the survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with a permanent disability for their life and quality of life.
As a result, if necessary, steroids should be used at a minimum and less time for COVID-19 patients.
Depression: As described above, during the cry of COVID - 19 many patients suffered as much stress as they had to endure long periods of imprisonment and severe uncertainty and see the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is important that mental counseling and long - term support be given to help patients recover from stress and return to normal health.
In accordance with human knowledge research until now, COVID-19 seems to have unique epidemiological features in SARS.
In addition to a frequency in the lower respiratory system, SARS-CV-2 is able to double in the upper respiratory capacity and cause little or no symptoms in the first stage of contact, the same as common CVs cause common colds.
Therefore, patients involved in the first stage or period of diagnosis can produce a large percentage of infection during everyday activities, causing great difficulty in controlling the control of the epidemic.
However, the influx of SARS-CV was thought to occur when patients were very sick, while most infections did not occur in the first grade.
As a result, the cry of COVID-19 is more critical and difficult to control than the SARS explosions.
There are many current efforts in China that include the Wuhan closing off the surrounding cities and the continuing closing of the entire population in hopes of disrupting the transmission of SARS-COV-2.
While these measures have serious economic and other world conditions, the number of new patients is declining, which indicates a decrease in the speed of the epidemic.
The most promising estimate is that the revolution will end in March and the phase of demination will continue for 3-4 months.
Other scholars, however, offer no such hope.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CV-2 may hold two thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-COV-2 were found in both the mid-tubrbinate and the throats of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly discovered virus may be a recombinant chapter similar to the fluency.
However, promising signs appear in China on the basis of the decline in the number of sick young people, which indicates that current techniques may be effective.
At first it was predicted that Ebola would have a million people and half a million of them died.
However, because of severe pent - up and deep - seated restraints, the disease is eventually controlled.
It may be, as SARS-COV, that SARS-CV-2 may be weak and may eventually become weak and eventually become less ill or more able to treat people.
A comparison of the COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is given below (Death.55).
SARS-COV-2 is most likely by coughing or sneezeing, and it is possible by direct contact with infected objects.
The virus was also detected in the feces, which produces a new chance of transmission from the egg to the mouth.
A recent survey of 38 patients reported that 41% of patients may have been admitted to hospitals, including 17 patients who had previously had other diseases and 40 health care workers.
Hence, greater precautions should be taken to protect people, especially health - care workers, health - care workers, family members, workmates, and even people who are close to patients or people who are dependent.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear your own masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respior (a series # 1860s) helps control the spread of germs.
Facial masks block fluids from a person who may have slipped into the air and clings to the face of things, where they can be passed on to other people.
However, only N95 checks (a series # 1860s) can protect you from inhaling small violins from 10 to 80 p.m., while only 5% of theseions are able to pass completely; SARS-CV-2 are the same size as SARS-CV and both about 85 n.
As cells are able to pass through five combined surgical masks, patients who work directly with patients must wear N95 masks (list # 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, health - care workers should wear appropriate protective glasses to reduce contact with germs.
Germs can infect an individual with the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor joined SARS-CV-2 although he was wearing N95 masks; the virus may have entered his body by entering his eyes and getting up.
As a result, health - care workers should also wear face - to - face masks or glasses while working with patients.
In a community in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash his hands with soap - rugs more often than usual, try to stay in the house to shut up and start contact with people who may be infected.
A distance of three steps is considered the right distance from patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of infection.
Although SARS-COV-2 arrived as a new virus in the world of humanity, its presence with the SARS-CV as reported on 7 January 2020 should be a warning to China because it still remembered the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, until the 19 January 2020, the director of the Center of Disease Control in Wuhan assures residents that the new virus has little and little renals when it goes from one person to another and that it is not a problem to prevent and control disease.
This message made the public suspicious, especially when the whole country was preparing for Spring Festival, and they missed a critical time to control the virus while it was still in Wuhan.
Chinese disease control agents may learn from this crucial study and make important future progress.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more careful when they make public declarations as each word is important to the citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sympathetic and responsive to information received from a clinic rather than expect official reports from doctors or officials; (3) prevent more from controlling what might be a epidemic in their first place than trying to comfort the public; and (4) more frequently do so as to improve public awareness of the disease and development of the development of the community's reaction and the development of social development.
The cry of COVID-19 caused by a new SARS-CV-2 virus at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is much like SARS-COV and symptoms are also the same between COVID-19 and SARS, a cry for COVID-19 created the feeling that SARS is in repeat.
There is, however, a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is vital for controlling the disease and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects more old people than are older and more male than women, and the risk of death is higher to adults than youths.
SARS has a mortality rate higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared with 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients pass the virus even when they have no symptoms while patients with SARS pass it when they are very ill, which causes a greater problem in controlling COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why the SARS-COV-2 is much faster and more widespread than SARS-CV.
A normal RNA of SARS-COV-2 may be toxic to some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who are treated may also become infected again.
This discovery greatly increases the risk of infection infection.
Since there is a rapid improvement in the design of COVID-19 research, a few serious problems still need to be resolved, including:
Where does SARS-CV-2 come from?
Although it was found that there were 96% similarities between SARS-COV-2 and two COV bats like SARS, we cannot conclude that SARS-CV-2 are coming from the bats.
Which animal in the center passed the virus from the first tower, say bats, to humans?
If we don't know the answers of #1 and 2, we cannot successfully stop transmission, and rioting can be worse at any time.
While cell models and biochemic analysis have shown that SARS-CV-2 adheres to ACE2, how does the virus actually enter the cells of the respiratory tract and cause changes that cause the resulting illness?
Is the virus again attached to cells that show ACE2 in other parts of the body?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot come to a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How do the genes of a virus change during human interaction?
Will it be a global epidemic, will it end like SARS or will it be worse from time to time as a cold?
It is important, but it may take some time to ponder the answers to the above questions and countless other questions.
Regardless of the cost, however, we have no choice but to prevent the epidemic as soon as possible and to restore our health to normal.
The origin of the virus from animals to humans of the coronavirus
The change and flexibility have encouraged the co-evolution of coronavirus (CVs) and its organization, which includes people, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two COVs (HCOVs) were known as the cause of minor illnesses, such as common colds.
Averbal respiration (SARS) and the Middle East respiration syndrome (MERRS) have changed to indicate how much damage HCV can cause and endanger life.
The appearance of SARS-CV-2 in China in mid-2019 once again placed COVs in a theater and surprised us with a high degree but with reduced ethogenicity compared with her sister SARS-COV.
HCV is a zoonosis, and understanding the origin of HCV will help us.
Many HCVs come from bats and do not cause disease in them.
The middle friends of some HCVs are also known.
The identification of animal pets has positive effects on the prevention of human diseases.
Research into the interactions of the CV organization with animals may provide important insight regarding the development of CV on human beings.
In this revision, we present a summary of the already existing knowledge concerning seven HCVs, and we will focus on the history of their discovery and their origin of the zoonotics and interconnection of various species.
More important, we compare and divide the different HCVs according to the theory of the mutation and the combination of genes.
The current PV (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successfully changing ecosystems as well as the effects of the virus’s alteration into the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (Covs) are part of the Coronahishidae family, which consists of a close, active, isolated RNA group of bacteria.
These bacteria contain the largest atoms of 26 to 32 pounds [32 kg] between RNA viruses called "CV" because of their cross - shaped microphology under the electron microscope.
According to the building, CVs has non-genetic atoms that do not have the same order.
Nearly three parts of the root consist of two large multi-large multip1 frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), translated into replicasse polyprotein polyprotein and p1abs.
Polyproteins are further processed to form 16 additional proteins without structure, called ansp1 ~/16.
The remaining portion of the frame contains theORF properties of the building, which include spikes (S), envelopes (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
The number of profiscoes related to the list also contains a list of different lists of COVs.
Based on the sequence of proteins, CVs are inserted into four categories (alpha-CV, beta-CV, gamma-Cov anddelta-CV), where the beta-CV field contains most of HCVs and is divided into four columns (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenic evidence has shown that bats and mice are the source of the alpha-COV genes and beta-CVs, while birds are the source of gamma-Cov and delta-CV.
For thousands of years, CVs has progressively passed off the boundaries of creatures and most of them become important to humans.
So far, seven CSVs (HCVs) are known.
Among them HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 Alpha-COV.
Other five beta-CVs include HCV-OC 43, HCOV-HKU1, setre as respieratory disorder coronavirus (SARS-CV), Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-COV) and SARS-COV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 often cause minor symptoms, such as common fever and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CV, MERS-CV and new SARS-CV-2 are being diagnosed, causing severe respiratory infections in a multitude of patients, resulting in a higher risk of developing acouse respiratory disorder (ARDS) and other diseases that occur without the lungs.
The first version of HCOV-229E, B814, was separated from normal colds in the mid 1960s.
Since then, more information has been obtained on the detailed HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43, both which causes birth signals.
In fact, it was adopted that HCVs are generally safe until SARS outbreaks.
The rise of SARS in 2003 is one of the most tragic in current history, causing more than 82,000 cases and having a mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East explosion of respiration syndrome (MERRS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with occasional elasticity in other parts of the world.
The new HCV (2019-nCOV), later named SARS-COV-2, is the cause of the ongoing outbreak of the colonvirus epidemic of 1920 (COVID-19), which kills more than 3,120 people and infects over 91,000 people on March 3,20.
The alarm has been crying again and the earth must be prepared for the coming SARS-CV-2 scourge.
All seven HCVs have the origin of the ozone layer from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Much evidence supports the origin of the development of all HCVs from bats, in which bacteria properly adapt to the situation and do not cause illness but show a variety of genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented major medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the world.
Tracking the origins of HCVs provides an object of understanding natural history, force, and development factors of the flight of creatures.
This can also guide or help in considering the cause, which is in the middle with the production of the SARS-CV-2 copy of the animal-COV-2, which will have a significant effect on future transmission prevention.
In this revision we draw a brief introduction of the origin of the zoonotic origin, a combination of different species and HCV-pathogenesisis.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the same piece that the HCV - parent bacteria often cause not sickness in their natural environment but that they cause sickness after they are joined by the various creatures with the new virus.
It also replaces the cycle of HCV when an increase in interconnection usually comes and the decline of the thogenicity.
The effects of continuing SARS-COV-2 are discussed in this context.
Animal Covs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first division of HCOV-229E type, B814 in what came out of the nose of patients who had contracted common fever, separate CVs had been separated from alternative animals of various kinds, including garlic, rats, cow, pigs, cat and dog.
Over the past decades, seven HCVs have been found.
A short summary of the history of HCV detection in sequence (The Table 1) may benefit and teach.
The first version of HCOV-229E was separated from the respiratory capacity of patients with high respiratory infections by the year 1996, and was accepted to develop in WI 38 synapses.
HCOV-229E patients had symptoms of normal fever, including headaches, coughing, malaria and sore throats, and fever and coughing were seen in 10,020%.
Later in 1967, the HCV-OC43 separated from the muscle tissue and the movement of the next series in the brain of nursing rats.
The properties of HCV-OC43 treatment seem to be similar to those caused by HCV-229E, which were not distinguished by symptoms in some respiratory infections such as hepatitis A and rhinoviruses.
Both HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43 are spread around the globe, and it is often joined during winter in good weather.
Usually, the two infections are less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy HCOV-229Es suffer from mild flu.
Only a few patients with a depressed immune system showed serious respiratory trouble.
SARS, also known as "an unusual pneumonia", was the first recorded HCV in human history and is the cause of SARS-CV, a third HCV.
The first illness caused by SARS can be followed until late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic led to a report of 8,096 sick people and 774 dead, scattered in many countries and countries.
In addition to the main transmitters, it was estimated that each event could cause about two more events, during a 4- to 7-day pre-emulsion period and the rise of the infection on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CV at first seemed to be suffering from yalgia, headaches, fever, malaria and fever, followed by dyspnea, coughing and breathing stress as later symptoms.
lymphopiania, abnormal liver operation, and high creatine cyanese are among the rare characteristics of ordinary viruses due to SARS.
The spread of an Alveor damage, the epithelic movement, and the rise of macrophages are marked for SARS patients.
At least 20-30% patients need emergency care and air ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, many body organs that include the nervous system, the liver, and the kidneys can also contribute to these critical conditions, often accompanied by a cetone storm, which may kill especially patients with antibodies that are exposed to the immune system.
The virus was first separated from the open lung surgery of the first relative of the patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made in connection with HCOV research.
The HCOV-NL63 was separated from a 7-year-old Dutch child by the end of 2004.
It was first found to be on the increase in young children, the elderly, and those with antibodies who had been exposed to respiratory infections.
The discovery of coryza, cenjanctitis, fever, and bronchiliitis is common to HCV-NL63.
One independent study described the isolation of the same virus from an eight - month - old pneumonia - patient male in the Netherlands.
Although discovered in the Netherlands, it is truly global.
It has been estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of normal respiratory infections, and its high risk occurred early in summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstractive laryngitis, also known as a cross.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was separated from a 71 - year - old male who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Apart from social engineering and bronchiolitis, HCOV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acoustatic equation.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 were found worldwide, causing short respiratory infections.
All these HCVs are well adapted to people and often have little chance of converting into the most throogenic diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons as in the unusual condition of the most deadly HCV-NL63 type, reportedly cause serious respiratory infections below China.
Often, when HCVs gain the ability to easily enter and maintain them in an ongoing state within the people, they also kill or become a little pathogenic.
The MERS-CV was first separated in 2012 from a 60 - year - old patient’s lung with serious pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the conditions confirmed are from the Middle East, imported conditions are spreading to nearby recruits in various European and Tunisia countries.
Another second blast occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 established cases.
The appearance of MERS treatment is similar to that of the SARS, which is marked by a progressive medical condition.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients suffer serious kidney failure, which is at present different from MERS among HCV diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gestrointantial symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Since February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 reported cases have been verified by 34.4%, which makes the MERS-CV one of the most dangerous microbes in humans.
From mid-December 2019 to its end, many patients with pneumonia known as linked to SARS-CV-2 syndrome were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization called the outbreak of lower respiratory respiratory infections caused by SARS-CV-2 as the Public Health Emergency to Concern the World and named it COVID-19.
On March 3, 2020, there were reported 90,053 patients in the world, with 3.4% of deaths.
Significantly, the number of deaths in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while one outside is 1.2%.
SARS-CV-2 causes serious respiratory infections such as SARS-CV and MERS-CV, which have been introduced as fever, coughs and dyspnea.
Patients also suffer from diarrhea.
The pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can make rapid progress to acute respiration stress syndrome.
Although SARS-CV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar because of the same high sequence of nucleotides of 82%, there are different classes in the branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-COV-2 appears a little thogenic but very much in comparison with SARS-CV and MERS-CV.
It is reported that there are people who have no symptoms with SARS-CV-2 and may be contributing to its rapid worldwide increase.
Comparing and dividing SARD-COV-2 with the other six HCVs produces very interesting similarities.
First of all, the menstrual period and the length of the progression of HCV is much the same.
In this regard, SARS-COV-2 follows the normal rent of six other HCVs.
Second, the quality of COVID-19 is between SARS-COV and HCOVs received in the community (that is, HCOV-299E, HC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-COV-2 shows the characteristics usually seen during the influx of HCVs found in the community, which include lack of clear symptoms, minor symptoms or lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, the lower set of emergency conditions of COVID-19 can also be seen as in SARS-CV condition, though the ratio is less or less.
Third, SARS-COV-2 links also show interesting tables with both the local HCVs and SARS-CV.
On the other hand, the transfer of SARS-COV-2 is as high as that of HCV acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it will still be proved whether the transmission of SARS-CV-2 is decreasing to people as in the SARS-CV and MERC-CV conditions.
Finally, like other HCVs, SARS-CV-2 can be found in samples in the wild.
Whether the SARS-COV-2 transmission plays an important role when it comes to SARS-CV under certain conditions will still be explained by future research.
It is also of great interest to see whether SARS-COV-2 will show the appearance of certain seasons as is the case with the HCVs available in the community.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CV-2 which include its intermittention, throgue and maintenance after passing through to the people will have an effect on the final outcome of the ongoing cry of COVID-19.
All HCVs found in the community are responsible for minor symptoms that are well adapted to people.
From one point of view, it may also be true that people are well compatible with these four HCOVs.
In other words, both probably survived the early HCV epidemic.
HCVs cause serious infections in humans, and people who suffer from HCV are no longer present.
To this end, HCVs must go back to the extent necessary to allow for the growth of changes that are in harmony with the factors of the birth of the system.
In this way, if SARS-COV-2 is persistent and infecting many people, it will have a greater chance of getting along with the people.
If they are highly compatible, their intervention may be difficult to prevent by closing them or by other means of controlling the flow.
For many years, four CVs have been found in society around society, which causes common colds to people who have the right response to antibodies.
These germs do not need an animal’s source.
In contrast, the SARS-CV and the ERS-CV in the Topogenic world has not yet been well compatible with the people and its interaction between people is unable to be preserved.
They need to keep themselves in shape and grow from their own biological source and want the opportunity to pass on to the victims who may be exposed, about one or more middle layer and raise strangers.
SARS-COV-2 have the same characteristics as both SARS-COV/MERS-CV and HCVs received in the community.
It depends as much as the HCVs are found in the community, at least in the original creation.
However, Pathogenic is much more than HCVs found in the community and has less ethogenic than SARS-CV or MERS-CV.
It will still be seen if it is to be fully adapted to humans and moves around without the source or the animal’s center.
Before discussing the origin of HCV animals, it will be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of variable, natural, biological, internal, and HCVs.
An animal becomes a substitute for HCOV if we hold a closely related ancestor associated with a high degree of nucleotide.
The original virus is usually highly compatible and does not cause the mystery.
Similarly, the source resources maintain HCV continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, strangers are naturally contagious and are natural HCV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCV is moved back to the central or middle layer in the community, it is not well compatible with the new environment and often causes illness.
The central figure may be a biological resource for human involvement and play a role in fostering a virus that allows it to resuscit and transfer to humans to increase population levels.
HCV can experience a final intervention if it is unable to maintain its involvement inside the centre of gravity.
In contrast, HCVs are able to adapt to the middle layer and even develop long-termimity.
In this setting, the central organizational unit becomes a natural resource.
An epidemiological data showed that back in view that the patient who is a symbol of the SARS had a history of contact with hunted animals.
The subsequent studies of proprietors showed that the IgG had an anti-Cov superior SARS-CV number compared with the number of ordinary people.
The masked palm civet (pakaka larvata) and the racoon in the biological market were found to carry bacteria such as SARS-CV are similar to SARS-CV.
This was directly supported by the fact that no further SARS reported after the murder of all stores.
However, it has been reported that some wildmas alm civets or the unretried farms of living animals had been contaminated in the SARS-CV, suggesting that the markets might be a middle-life plant but not a natural source of SARS-COV.
Significantly, 80% of the various game animals in the Guangzhou market have a immune system against SARS-CV, we are unable to ignore the possibility that many mammals are the main entertainers of the SARS-COV.
All of these appear to be the last SARS-COV players.
A subsequent study of the natural SARS-CV creature produced a coV closely associated with the bat, called SARS-related Rhinolopus bat HKUM3 (SARSR-Rh-BatCOV HKUM3), which is found on a Chinese horse-sho3).
These baleen bat when it comes to antibodies against SARS-CV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCH53 genes.
This and other batcos shared by 88-92% of nucleotide sequences and SARS-CV.
These studies have led to the development of a new idea that bats would attract new human - looking pickptogens.
CVs like SARS (SL-COVs) are marked on bats, but they are not only those called WV1 are able to be classified as a living virus.
The people are known as the SARS-CV server.
A WV1 taken from a bat dung sample was shown to use a bat, civet and a human ACE2 as a human incoming cell.
Interestingly, the sedative of patients recovered from SARS was capable of destroying WEV1.
Thus far, WVV1 represents the closely related ancestor SARS-COV to the bats, which shares 95% of the nucleotide sequence.
Although there is a high degree of oxygen between these two bacteria, it is generally believed that WV1 is not a single parent virus for SARS-CV and the bats had a nearby SARS-CV virus.
Xylogenetic analysis includes MERS-COV with the same team as the COV-HKul4 bug and the COV-HKUR5 bat.
The CV-HKU4 bat and the MERS-COV use the same organization's compliant, pipedyl perptile 4 (DPP4), on the entry of the virus.
The sequence of RNA's RNA's RERS-COV-CoV's-CoV is closely related to their European beta-Cov-cov-batives.
So far, no MERS-CV is alive from wild bats.
The MERS-COV and its immediate relative COV-HKUR25 bat sharing only in 87% of the nucleotide sequence biology.
As a result, bats may not be a nearby source of MERS-CV.
On the other hand, surveys in the Middle East have shown that camels are caused by aerospace system in the immune system directly killing MERS-CV, much like camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
A living MERS-CV-like virus found in humans was separated from the hydromediatic tube, which further showed that camels are the real source of the MERS-COV.
It is also noteworthy that small signs were often seen but a large release of the camel has been transmitted by the MERS-CV on the basis of research.
Significantly, not only by the respiratory tract but also through the mouth - to - mouth tube, which is also the primary route to infection from bats.
However, questions remain, since many MERS's illness has no record of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, it may be that a human interaction from one to another or unknown link systems involving unknown ERS-COV animals.
SARS-COV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotides with the CV RaTG13 bat separated from the Rihinolopus afinis.
As with SARS-CV and MERS-COV, the variety of sequences between SARS-CV-2 and RATG13 is too large to be assigned a parent's relationship.
This means, bats may have had a nearby source of SARS-CV-2 except where a similar similar bat is found in the future.
It is estimated that the SARS-COV-2 will be among wild animals sold and killed at the Huanaan Sead Wheele Market, most of which were associated with the first COVID-19, which indicates that there may have been an event of contact from animals to humans.
A few recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of small mammals known as parongolins (Manis javanica) may be caring for older beta-Cov related SARS-COV-2.
These new gengolin COVs divided by 85-92% of nucleotides and SARS-COV-2.
However, they are related equally closely to the RaTG13 by about 90% of the self-c's values at the frequency sequence of the nucleotide.
They combine into two subgroups of bacteria similar to SARS-CV-2 on the phylogenenetic tree, one of them sharing the background of the most similar location (RBD) and SARS-CV-2, with amino acid sequence of 97.4%.
In sharp contrast, the RBS-COV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although there is a high degree of large degree of homology sequence.
A previous study of sick pangolins reported the discovery of infected cantigs in lung samples, which appear to be related to SARS-COV-2.
The study used a variety of construction methods and hand-organizations to form a sequence of sub-division composed of about 86.3% of the total length of the virus's root system.
We cannot set aside the chance that the pangolin is one of the nearby SARS-COV-2 friendly animals.
However, at present there is no proof that the pangolin is a direct source of SARS-COV-2 due to the differences between SARS-CV-2 and SARS-CV-Congolin related beta-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is much shorter between SARS-CV-2 and SARS-CV-2 of the secondary-beta-CV.
SARS-CV-2 conversion effort on bats, pangolins and other mammals will still be found.
Although high-quality levels are found in RBDs between SARS-CV-2 and pangolin, SARS-COV-2 related to beta-COV, SARS-CV-2 and RaTG13, and RATG13 to share high levels of geno.
There are high critics that a high level of RBD between SARS-CV-2 is related to beta-CV and SARS-CV-2 is conducted by a combination of contact.
One suggestion recommends the recombination between SARS-COV-2 pangon related to beta-COV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal.
As the force driving the conversion process, recombination is spread between beta-COVs.
The conclusion is not yet reached as to the origin of the nearby SARS-COV-2-2.
Apart from the very active HCVs, the origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCU1 have also been investigated.
Phlogenetic evidence has shown that both HCOV-NL63 and HCV-229E may have started in vogues, while parent bacteria in HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 are found in rats.
It is reported that the ARCV.2 Apparachian RidgeCV (Apparachian Ridge) found on a three-colored North America board displayed a relationship close to HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was related in genetics to another Havana, called the Hippopoderos/Gina Kwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while camereds have been accused of being its close compass.
For details, the current information about the animal origins of known HCOVs is reached in Picture 1 and Web 2.
A study of physics has given evidence of the circumstances of HCV species in history.
When the HCV-OC43 from another animal to be passed on to the people it was from domestic animals about 1890, a respiratory plague was recorded.
The history of the interconnection of HCOV-229E species is not very clear.
A related HCV-29E findings have been found.
Among them is the alpha-CV for alpaca.
A few evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, people not the alpacas may have contact with bats in the same environment.
Instead, people are close to the alpacas.
Second, alpha-CVs are associated with various HCV-229Es and does not cause infection in bats, while thealpaca-CValpical caused an invasion of respiratory infections.
Finally, analpaca's alpha-CV has not yet been found in wild animals.
As a result, we cannot ignore the possibility that the alpacas get an Alpha-COV associated with HCOV-229E to people.
In fact, bats are a direct source of bacteria that cause people to become infected, including the bacteria of the rabbi, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats may be able to transmit HCOV-229E directly to people.
On the other hand, when the Alpha-CVs works as a set of HCV-229E genes, alpacas and hydromedia camels may be a central biologically transmitting infection to humans, as is MERS-CV.
The MERS-CV is a good example of the interaction of different creatures from bats to the dromedary camel to humans.
The origin of MeRS-CV's evolution from bat is known for its first introduction and is strengthened by the following findings.
Evidently, bats give different kinds of bacteria a chance to exchange genes between different animals and different animals.
Long life, crowded colonies, close public relations, and powerful flying skills are all the best conditions for bats to become a good biological laboratory.
On the other hand, for hundreds of years MERS-COV has been introduced to the dromedary camel.
It is well suited to these repentant camels to become the center layer of sustainable resources and natural resources.
MERS-COV causes little illness and has a lower rate of change in these animals.
Its intermittent is a mistake and people remain the last MERS-CV compound since its transmission is not possible to be saved.
In contrast with the role of camels in MERS-COV transmission, the role of the pangolins, if available, in the transfer of SARS-CV-2 is different.
In particular, beta-Covs in pangolins cause serious illness in the pangolins.
She may be the last match of the battery-Cov related to SARS-COV-2, such as vevets in SARS-CV condition.
SARS-COV-2 chances from animal to human beings should be taken into consideration or not from future research.
First, bats may be a source of infection related to SARS-CV-2 similar to SARS-CV-2.
People may play the same role as bats by performing animal surgery or coal mining.
Second, the pangolins may be a growing environment in the middle where the virus related to SARS-CV-2 has recently been set up.
People are infected by the use of surgery and eating the meat of the hunt.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals may be referred to SAORS-COV-2.
A study of animal conservation and wildlife conservation is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and reconciliation of SARS-COV-2 may occur in the third association of both bats and pangolins.
An animal's origin of SARS-COV-2 is still continuing.
Apart from the various kinds of animalists, there are three main elements on the side of the virus that are important in making COVs across the boundaries of creatures.
First, its high number of changes in RNA repeat.
Compared with other RNA viruses that have a single line, the average rate of change of COVs may be considered "little" to "higher" depending on the change rate of 010-4 per year at each 2 station, depending on the level of the CV coordinate for new players.
COVs have ixorobonicases for looking for errors, removal results in extreme changes and loss of energy or the inability to develop properly.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analge Remdesir is known to suppress the frequency of the COV by blocking this xorionuclease and RNA polymerase dependent on the RNA.
Remdesir is one of the most promising of the latter against SARS-CV-2 research studies.
Nevertheless, the rate of change for CVs is about one million times higher than that of non-compliant.
In addition, the number of changes is usually higher if the CVs are not properly compatible with the club.
Compared with SARS-CV with a high number of changes, the number of changes SARS-COV-2 appears to be lower, suggesting a high degree of human tolerance.
Supposedly, it may already have been adopted by another neighbor.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this applies again to MERC-COV, which is well matched by hydrometric camels.
It is thought that genetic mutations will probably cause the goals and anti-COV-2 viruses to slow down.
Secondly, a large RNA element in the CVs uses more flexibility in the transformation of the genome and recombination, thus increasing the opportunity of co-evolution for different creatures, which is beneficial to the appearance of new CVs when conditions are suitable.
This is supported by many different reading frames and the function of the protein produced by the 30° logome.
Third, CVs who stay there change the states inadvertently during RNA repeats in a different way "to copy" option.
In the instrument of blending, a change of type occurs regularly during the CV RNA scan.
The most full length of hemologous and the subgenomics may meet together to form new COVs.
Phlogenetic evidence of natural reunions has been found in both HCOV-HKU1, HC43, HC43, and comp animals such as SL-CV for bat and BatCV-HKU9.
Abelie connection with the virus and the virus in connection with the intra
Apart from the three components of the virus mentioned above, the link between the virus and the reactor is another major factor affecting the interaction of different species.
Here, a reunification of SARS-CV is considered a general example, which presented evidence of a partial selection between the events of the intercombination of different species.
Based on comparing analysis between separate persons and SARS-CVs on Civet, it is estimated that SARS-CV is dealing with a quick response to different entertainers, especially by a change in the SRD of S proxy.
Generally, RBD on S CV's software cooperates with the server server and is strongly selected for the response of the immune system.
In SARS-CV, RBD is in 318 amino acids to 510 part of S1, which adheres to the ACE2 of the human beings and its creceptors for infection.
SARS-CV is able to see an ACE2 environment of different animals, including bats, rovet, mice andraccoon dog, allowing a virus to be transmitted to different creatures.
In fact, only six remains of amino acid that were noted to be different from the isolation of the human virus and a chivet in RBD, 4 of which are found in a motif sticking to the distribution to deal with the ACE2 server.
The SARS-Cov-civet has a change of K479N and S487T on its RBD, which may increase the level of the contact of the Spike protein and the human ACE2 distribution.
In other words, this change of two amino acids may be essential to the transmission of the virus to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-COV-2 has the same share of the SARS-CV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CV-2 and SARS-CV in S-CV unit of S-SD means that the level of contact with S and ACE2 of people may have changed.
In fact, the study of cylo-EM shows a high degree of 10- to 20 curves of this angle between ACE2 people and SARS-CV pro-CV.
It will also be of interest to determine whether another coreceptor is needed in the introduction of SARS-CV-2.
Interestingly, HCOV-NL63 is again attached to ACE2 but with a different section of S.
There are other HCV services, such as aminopuptidase N in HCOV-229E, and 9-O-actylad crylic acid for HCV-OC43.
They may also be regarded as a reason for the successful cops in humans after a combination of different creatures from their animal breeders.
In addition to cellular components, the result of a combination of different forms with HCVs is also controlled by reliance on another being and the limit factors.
The differences between these compounds between humans and friends, which are a natural source of HCVs as bats, hydromedary camels, and rats may cause the border between different creatures.
HCVs should take the characteristics of reliance on the owner and interfere with the development of the environment so that there can be a successful interaction of creatures.
In this regard, cell - cell selections in this vital area would be observed and noted.
SARS-CV-2 general removation of non-similaration of the environment may be beneficial.
New HCV appearance: return
The variety of bat bat provides a wide range of opportunities for new HCVs.
In this sense, batcos serve as a group of HCV genes.
In addition, rapid changes and recombination of genes continue HCV conversion and serves as two important steps in the process.
For example, the discovery or loss of genes that make up a new protein code has the power to alter the virus’s phenotypes.
Between SARS-COV proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in human understanding, since bat - related bacteria are separated but found producing different RF8 proteins.
An element of the removal of 29-nucleotides of SARS-CVs has been found in various types separated at the beginning of a human epidemic.
This removal separates the ORF8 into the ORF8a and the ORF8b and is thought to be a transition that encourages a change of nonparticipation.
Besides, SARS-CV may have a history of recombination with the blood-plasses and gammama list, where a large number of sub-division points were found in the RNA polymerase depend on the RNA.
Reunitation areas were found again in ansp9, in a large portion of the ns10, and in parts of the enss14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-COV epidemic experienced reuniting events between different ranges, which occur in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from SARS-CV and MERS-CV, recombination events have been marked by other HCVs, where HCVs are reunited with other COV animals in their nonstructures.
It should also be noted that the selection may be contributing to undetectable changes in biological genes, which may result in freeing the bacteria from the pressures of the choice used, such as those of nuclear immune systems.
An example of these effects is the loss of RF4 with the full length of HCV-229, due to the removal of a double nucleotide.
Although complete RF4 was identified in the flag and camel related to HCOV-229E, the aceca alphal-CV show a single nucleotide insert, which leads to a different frame change.
Finally but most important, new HCOV conversions are also carried out by pressure to be selected from its source friends.
There were no signs or signs found only when the bats were joined with the CVs, which indicate a similar link between the CVs and the bats.
It seems that bats are well fitted with COVs according to building and operation.
For example, a disorder of the use of responses that promote inflammation in bats easily reduces the pathology introduced by COVs.
Besides, the function of the natural killer cell to bats is stressed because of the rise in reactions of the natural cryptic gland NKG2/CD94 and the lower shown quality of the complex I class Ihistocomability.
In addition, the high level of oxygen (ROS) being built up by high - pressure cooking of bats may affect both the pressure of a COV respiration and the testing of errors with ixorobocyase, thus providing the pressure for the selecting of the most pheric species when it is introduced to a new plant.
Highly pathogenic types may also be altered by recombination, leading to new protein discovery or protein characteristics for joint interaction.
As a result, it is not only fortunate that three new HCVs appeared two decades ago.
CVs do not become ill or cause little symptoms to their main friends like bats and camels.
They went fast without encouraging strong reactions to the immune system.
Here are some secrets why without symptoms can be seen and what causes serious conditions in people’s health.
Particularly serious symptoms are caused by excessive immune activity and a cytokine storm where there is strong immune reactions, lung damage is more severe.
In contrast, for those who do not show signs of illness, the immune response has been doubled in the number of COVs.
The same strategy for distinguishing the reactions of the immune system may have a beneficial effect on treatment against SARS-CV-2.
The inputferon response is particularly strong on the bats.
As a result, the use of I interferon I type at least in the early stages of joining SARS-CV-2 to people should be useful.
Furthermore, the use of NLRP3 inflammmasome for bats is not valid.
According to this estimate, NLRP3 inflammmasome by MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-COV-2 follows the usual frame for SARS-CV and MERS-CV.
Although the battery-CoV shared by 95% of nucleotide homology and SARS-CV, there is also a 96% shared nucleotide hormone and SARS-COV-2.
Although chivets and other market animals have been found to harbor bacteria such as SARS-CV, the nearby middle-internationals have not yet been found.
It has been found that beta-Congolins have a structure similar to SARS-COV-2, which indicates that they may be some middle-ongolins or beta-Congolins, pargolins may have a hand in the genetic components of the SARS-COV-2 version.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CV-2 is man-made deliberately or incorrectly.
The CVs are returned to the theater because of the post-war explosion of SARS-CV-2.
The study of the CVs on bats and other animals has profoundly altered our view of the importance of zoonotic origins and HCV animal resources in human interactions.
The widespread evidence indicates that SARS-CV, MERS-COV and SARS-CV-2 has a sub-baby source and is passed to the people by middle friends.
Since having joined SARS-CV from human contact with market - carvets, closing the market of living animals and killing vevets could have ended the SARS epidemic.
In the same opinion, pangolins should be removed from the biological markets to prevent possible interconnection, considering the discovery of many beta-Cov lists of pangoliin closely related to SARS-COV-2.
However, whether it is transmitted and how it is transmitted to humans by pangolin and other mammals will yet be explained at future funerals.
On the other hand, MERS-CV has been present for a long time on the datamer.
These camels are an important means of transport as well as a main source of meat, honey, skin, and wool for local people.
It is widely distributed in the Middle East and in Africa.
It is therefore impossible for all camels to be killed to control the MERS, as is true in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spreading of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To prevent the repeated MERS riots, a broad approach should be used to create effective goals against the camel MERS-CV, along with other measures to control the disease.
Since we cannot eliminate the bacteria, new genotypes may develop to cause outbreaks.
Various types of COV amoontics rotate in the wilderness.
In particular, the strong Avocado bat differs greatly.
There are many opportunities for these examples of zoonotics to change and reunite, resulting in new COVs who are more able to interact with each other and/or kill people in the future.
The tradition of eating wildlife in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a better schedule of preparation and response.
In fact, most microbes have a long life span on earth.
They stay in their natural habitat until they have the opportunity to leave.
Although bats have many traits that encourage spread of bacteria, the possibility of contacting bats and other wild animals can be lost if people are taught that they are distant.
Continued care of mammals is needed in order to better understand CV's ecology and its natural predators, which will be useful in preventing the flow from animals to humans and the future revolutions.
At the conclusion, the best way to prevent the microorganism is to keep people away from the natural environment that is the natural sources of zonootic bacteria.
A few parts of the puzzle origin of SARS-CV-2 is not yet found.
First of all, if bats transfer the original SARS-CV-2 on the pangolins, it will be helpful to see which conditions the bats and pangolins are capable of sharing the environment.
Second, if bats play a key role in human interactions, it should be determined by how people communicate with bats.
Third, if a nursing animal serves as a true centre of life, the way we deal with the various kinds of people, bats, and pangolins should be made clear.
Finally, as many mammals and pets may be exposed to SAORS-CV-2, both precautions and investigations should be made.
If there may be a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CV-2 or its similar parent bacteria will be found in its natural environment in the future.
Further research in this area will explain the nature of the SARS-COV-2 animal evolution, with significant effects on the prevention and management of COVID-19 of the population.
A review of the evaluation of those who are "recognised" and "provable" that they suffer from COVID-19 is required.
On 6 February 2020, our team had published a program of quick screening and treatment for the 2019 new coronavirus internCovus (201919-CV), and this event provided our experience as well as the necessary insurance to fight this global epidemic.
However, the colonvirus disease of 2009 (COVID-19) is increasing with our awareness and understanding based on continued research and medical experience; hence, screening techniques and treatment continue to be repeated.
In this book, we answered one comment about our criminal and gave the subject of a new evaluation of those who are "rebuked" and "verified" that they are ill in accordance with Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seven edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new colonavirus (2019-nCOV) had caused outbreaks, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named as sere acute respiratory syndrome cryonic 2 (SARS-COV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO referred to COVID-19 as a epidemic.
In order to combat the SARS-COV-2 interference, our team has established an early response rate and is printed on the Internet on the Military Medical Research in February 2020.
It has received much attention since it was published.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, caution and knowledge about it is increasing according to the findings of research and medical experience; therefore, studies and treatments continue to be revised.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19, published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.www.nc.g.c.n/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have produced seven volumes in which some things have been dramatically changed.
Our review received notice from Zhou et al., providing a simple suggestion of points based on their experience.
Their work adds new proof of our epidemic and makes a significant reference to this epidemic throughout the world.
We commend their vital work and offer our thanks.
However, their DO needs to be repaid in accordance with the recent Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to ensure a suspected illness, it needs to be corrected by any one of the elements of epidemic history and by two exhibitions for general reviews, or it needs to meet three factors for non - known medical treatment:
The history of epidemiological: (1) the history of visiting or staying in the town of Wuhan and the environment, or some communities where the problem of COVID - 19 was reported 14 days before the beginning of symptoms; (2) the history of contact with people connected with SARS-CV-2 (by nucleic acid tests); (3) the history of contact with patients or breathing symptoms in the Wuhan city and environment, or other communities where COVD-19 are reported in the 14 days before the start of symptoms; (4) the history of contact with many patients who are involved with a person who have had 1 / or who have had symptoms and had symptoms between the home, such as local, and the church, and the home.
Symptoms of treatment: (1) fever along with/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) with the visual aspects of COVID-19; (3) the total number of white blood cells that indicate a normal, low, or reduced amount of lymphocyte.
The diagnosis of a confirmed illness should be based on the one suspected case of the following eptogenic or cryptographic evidence: (1) the slowing PCR of the actual period of SARS-CV-2; (2) the sequence of the total level of the virus that displays the elevated hormone levels in the new cronavirus bacteria; (3) the presence of a positive IgM and the IgG for SARS-CV-2 test; or the correctness of the IRCR-COB-CO-CO-CO-CO, which is the best response to the best.
We see that the real period of PCR of nucleic acid in the respiratory or blood samples is made up of two systems (18 January 2020) and 3 (2 January 2020).
Pathogenic findings in the blood sample are made on four national programs (27 January 2020) and 5 (8 February 2020); and the evidence for the solar system is included in the seventh order.
These changes are based on the continued work of researchers in the search for high nucleic acid detection, as well as for a respirator scan, which has increased the availability of different tissue, and has contributed to the overall effect of the immune system on the established matter.
Besides, there is additional evidence to remind us that we are on guard against patients with unusual symptoms and those who have no symptoms.
Hence, the Zhou et al flow chart should be replaced, as it refers to a person who has no symptoms of treatment as "as a low risk."
The point process also needs to be reassured at work and in progressive medical studies.
In conclusion, we hope for further evidence to come and ask that the disciples observe it.
In order to make a diagnosis of "redicted illness" and "vulnerable illness", we recommend that it be followed and heard by new international services at their home.
Our hosts will also return our net to provide help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest number of day.
yesterday, Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths caused by COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of days caused by a virus.
Since yesterday, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, the Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) has reported that the number of patients who are sick is 114 and 33 who live at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In the media, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the dead include four men as well as one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were over 60, two between 81 and 60, and one was between 41-50.
He also said that two of them had been from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announces that COVID-19 is a pestilence on March 11.
The hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news source, that one of the dead was Jaal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an Internet video announcement, Bangladesh Road Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said that public transport will be closed for more time than that planned, until the next Saturday.
This ban on public transport had begun on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
transport of important items - for treatment, fuel and food, is still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were on March 8, of two people who returned from Italy with their wife.
On March 19, the three were already healed.
The number of SARDs-Ccomp-2 is more than one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of people with SARS-COV-2 coronavirus passed over a million worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University chart.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked with COVID-19, a disease caused by Coronavirus.
This happened on the same day when Malawi confirmed her first disease caused by Coronavirus and Zambia had her first death related to coronavirus.
North Korea has said, beginning on Thursday, that it is one of the few countries that have no coronavirus.
The morning, the World Health Organization has compiled a report of a confirmed illness of 1,051,635, which includes 79,332 ailments before 10 a.m., according to Central European Europe (000 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand coronavirus cases are recorded, related to about 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News quotes the Johns Hopkins University data, that there are more than 1,000 deaths in the US on Wednesday due to the cronavirus failure.
Around the world, nations have declared strict measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyan, Moscow's city, spread the siege of the city until May 1.
Throughout the world, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue without work until April 30.
Portugal’s parliament has resolved to expand the national emergency in 15 days; the vote is won by 220 votes, ten votes, and one has a vote against this.

The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, has declared that the state has passed its law of staying at home until May 1.
Australia’s stores reduce the price of a small house paper on each purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australia's Wolworths and Coles have reduced its purchase of toilet paper so that one can buy two as well as one pack from each purchase in a store in the entire country, respectively.
ALDI also introduces a limit of one pack, Monday.
These levels are recorded as messages on exit, and on the Facebook pages of this store.
The buyers have continued to buy their bulk because of fear of COVID-19 if they have to separate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths reconvenes the purchase of toilet paper from those who were brought home to be one check per order.
These changes are followed by the fore-end of four-deckers on each purchase that was introduced by the Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"U-Coles, in its March 8, news commission, reported that by the end of the set of four bills, "" many stores are still losing goods after the hour of their delivery."", and called the need "animity"", whereas ALDI, in its Facebook package on Tuesday, said " "and"."
"Bast sell" very high" last week, according to the Wolworth's attorney.
Costco stores in Canberra also multiply the number allowed to be two sacks a week ago.
In order to deal with the shortage, Coles ordered the largest packages for the surgeons and announced the increase in the number of operations, the Wolworths ordered an extra piece, while the ALDI made a set-up parcel of Wednesday to be readily available.
Russell Zimmerman, the senior director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that the merchants are trying to raise the cane, but the ends of the local council regarding the time of the carriage of trucks make things difficult.
He expects the cost of production to rise, as surgeons try to meet the need, with a few parcels.
On Tuesday, the ALDI announced that as a result of the rapid release of the canal, some stores are unable to continue with the Wednesday detective.
In a report in News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a Queensland University of Technology specialist, says that stores fill a lot of stores every night.
Mark noted that a small house paper is a heavy item, leading to a low number of toads in numbers, and, once finished, leaving a large opening open, which reinforces the feeling that it is worshiped.
Coles and Woolworths have a view [that] if there were many items in the drawers, if a product similar to small home paper trucks and tractors might be [sold] and there is a lot, you could probably reduce fear from the ABC News.
The inventor of the reproduced public paper Who Gives a Crap said that on Wednesday they were exhausted.
Kimberly- Clark, who made Kleex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Parper making Sorbent, stressed that they work 24/7 to keep the product available, according to the News.com.
Domain.com, a house seller, reports that some house vendors give free paper to the first person who is loaded in an organization in Melbourne, where a few services are conducted because the buyers have time to relax because of the long days of Labour Day.
The Thursday version of the TNT News, a Darwin daily printed newspaper, installed a 9 - page appendix intended to be cut and used as a public paper.
The stores initially hesitate to set limits, according to the ABC Australian report on March 3 when they said they did not have access to the purchase limits.
Russell Zimmerman also has a high need for other products, including breakings, tractors, dried foods, soap for washing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday night the supermarket sold on the British Internet Ocado was seen to catch the purchase of Andres's public paper so that two of a 12 trucks cook.
The World Health Organization calls COVID-19 epidemic
On the third day, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 — a disease caused by Coronavirus SARS-COV-2 — epidemic.
"Whereas the word "" refers to the extent of the disease we are affected, not in the way in which specific examples are harmful, WHO has shown to care for the need to run governments in action:"
All countries are no longer able to reverse the epidemic.
If countries do research, investigate, are here, divide, follow, and respond by controlling human resources, says Tedros Adano Ghebreyus, director of WHO.
We are deeply concerned about both the pervasive and heavy mass distribution as well as the lack of movement in awesome degrees.
"According to Dr. Tom Frieden, who was the former director of the United States's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a disease with no previous link."
"He said, according to the notice declared to the CNN in February, "and" besides the influenza, no other respiratory virus has been followed from it to the global spread."
"He is a Hebrewbereyus has given the same idea, "We've never seen before the plague removed from the coronavirus."
"You've continued," and we've never ever seen an outbreak at the same time."
The new condition of the plague follows the WHO's decision of January's plan to call the eruption a global crisis of the emergency state of public health.
"The director of the United States' National Institute of Alergy and Infectious Diseases's, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said, "What remains is to be worse."
Since Thursday, the Associated Press reports that there are at least 126,000 examples of COVID-19 worldwide, which has led to more than 4,600 dead.
The scourge of 1990–20 coronavirus is an ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the sere acute respiratory syndrome cryonics 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was held in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and was declared the Public Health Emergency on All Nations on January 30, 2020, and was viewed as a epidemic on 11 March 2020.
Since 10 April 2020, the 1.61 million accurate examples of COVID-19 have been reported in countries with 4210 boundaries, leading to 97,000 deaths with certainty.
Some 36,000 persons have recovered.
The number of examples of destruction has been estimated at 4% in China, at the same time the globe range from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include heat, sweat, and restlessness.
Problems may include pneumonia and acute respiration syndrome.
The period of exposure to symptoms usually lasts for five days, but it can range from two to fourteen.
There is no known cure or treatment that can defeat the virus.
The basic method of treatment consists of washing the hands, covering the mouth while coughing, keeping a distance between you and others, and keeping oneself out with people who suspect that they might be infected.
The authorities around the world are now responding to restrictions on travel, separation, movement, safety measures on the workplace, and land control.
The plague has led to severe economic and social upheavals worldwide, to slow down or further the flow of sports, religious, political, and cultural events, as well as to the lack of basic needs that have been delayed.
Schools, including courses, are banned throughout the country or 193 countries, affecting 99.4 percent correctly for the majority of students worldwide.
Wrong information about the virus has been spread on the Internet, and there have been cases of racial prejudice and discrimination against Chinese people, other people from the East and the descendants of the Far East, and the appearance of the North Asians, and others from the world with many examples of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel rates and the closing of large industries, there has been a decrease in pollution of air and carbon dioxide.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (Hubei capital) report a series of non-generated examples of pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and a survey was opened early in January 2020.
Many examples have been related to the Huanaon Seaod Wholele Market, so the virus is caused by the origin of the biological origin of the animal.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-COV-2, the first emerging virus that is associated with the chainaviruses, cronaviruses of the pangolin, and SARS-CV. The first known person who showed symptoms was later found to be ill in December 2019, and that the person never had a clear relationship with the seat network.
In the first series of examples reported on December 2019, three parts were found connected to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an uncertain report from the South China Morning Post raised that the following example from 17 November 2019, of a 5- year - old person of the province of Hubei, may be the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new examples are reported falling down in China but are growing by hail in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, a number of new examples outside China and have passed the number of new Chinese examples for the first time.
There may be reports under examples, especially among those with low symptoms.
In 26 February, small examples were set among young people, those who had sinned 19 and below formed 2.4% of the world's examples. The chief science counselor of the United Kingdom's, Patrick Vallannce, was joining 60% of the British community will need to be joined in order for epephetive alcohol to be achieved.
Examples refer to the number of persons tested for COVID-19, and their checks confirming the accuracy of the procedure.
Since 23 March, no country has checked more than 3% of its population, and many countries had laws to avoid a study of those who had only dark symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, until 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 had not yet been found, and this unwritten combination is the source of 79% of recorded cases of disease.
A mathematical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of additions in Italy is much higher than reported examples.
The first estimate of the simple birth of COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that it may be 5.7.
Most cases with COVID-19 are recuperating.
For those who do not recover, the time from the form of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, which are most common to 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, at least 97,000 deaths were set as a reason for COVID-19.
In China, since 5 February about 80% of the dead were more than 60, and 75% are already having health problems including heart disease and diabetes. The official death rates of COVID - 19 normally refer to people who are tested for the dead are confirmed by COVID by a law procedure.
The true number of the dead may be very large, since it does not include everyone who dies without a thorough -b. at home, in the home of the elders, etc.
A data data from Italy found that the number of deaths during the plague passed the official death rates due to COVID in 4-5x.
"A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know" that [the released death figure] is under comparison", a statement corresponding to U.S. accounting reports of an eloctal statistics in the U.S.. Sub-CA. such estimates are common if there is a epidemic, such as H1NN1 and four flu. The first deaths were confirmed in Wuhan on 9 January 2020".
The first deaths outside China itself occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first deaths outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On 28 February, except in China itself, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March, more than 40 countries and areas had reported death, on all continents except Antarctica. There are several measures often used to calculate death rate.
These figures vary from place to place, and are influenced by the size of the study, the quality of health care, treatment procedures, time since the onset of puberty, and social factors such as age, sex, and general health. The déth-to-case ratio shows the number of the dead by the number of examples studied during a certain period.
By supporting Johns Hopkins University statistics, the Global Death-to-case traffic is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) since 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to location.
In China, ratings of death-to-case rapio dropped from 17.3% (for those who had symptoms appearing on 1,010 January 2020) to .7% (for those who had symptoms appearing on 1 February 2020). Other measures include carity negativeity rate (CFR), which shows a percentage of people who die from disease, and infraction factority rate (IFR), which shows percentage of infected (exprience and undiagnosed) death.
These figures do not depend on time and follow the number of individuals from the link in the model solution.
A number of highly educated people tried to calculate the numbers of certain people.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidnce- Based Medicine estimates that infestation factor factor rate for the general epidemic is between 0.1% and 0.1%.39%.
A high estimate of this rate is consistent with the results from an informal survey of COVID-19 Germany, and a study of statistics that evaluate the results of CFR surveys.
WHO asserts that the plague can be controlled.
The exact height and height of the eruption are uncertain and can vary from place to place.
"Maciej Boni of Penn State University said," "If left unsaid, intercombine outbreaks are reduced in nature and begin to decrease when the disease is lost by the last of those who can be found."
"But it is nearly impossible to make a guess which is right now concerning when that will be."
"Chong Nanshan's chief public medical adviser Zong Nanshan said "May be finished by June" if all countries are able to follow the action of WHO to prevent the spread of infection."
"In 17 March, Adam Kurharski of the London School of Hygie & Tropical Medicine spoke that SARS-CV-2 "" will go around, strongly for one or two years."
"According to the study of the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other steps will be required" until the solution is obtained (by bathing 18 months or more)."
"Wiliam Schaffer of Vanderbilt University said, " "I think" it is impossible that this coronavirus is easy to pass away forever" and "it may become a year's disease, return every year."
Return rage will depend on strong defense of the flock and the extent to which they change themselves
COVID-19 symptoms may be negative to one and people involved may have no symptoms.
The most common symptoms are heat (8%) and dry (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of saliva and fibrosis (phlegm), shortness of breath, shortness of breath, muscle and joints, sore throats, headaches, colds, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO has said that 1 person in 6 is seriously ill and has a respiratory problem.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list showing symptoms such as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or depression, persistent urination, difficulty in waking up, and cancer face or lips; rapid medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The development of disease in this regard may lead to serious pneumonia, abspiratory disorder, susiotic shock, and death.
Some of those affected may have no symptoms, no medical symptoms, but their research results confirm the link, so researchers have offered advice that those who have had close contact with those who have been convinced must be hired closer and have been immersed to confirm the absence of the disease.
China's comparison to those with no signs of radio dropped from a few to 44%.
A typical warm period (the period between addition and occurrence of symptoms) has a range from one to 14 days; usually five days. To make an example of uncertainty, to measure half of the cases of COVID-19 who lost a smell was 30% and then down to 15%.
Other details about the spread of disease are still considered.
The disease believes that it is spread mainly during close contact and small bits that form when you cough, sneeze, or speak; when the close contact is about 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that unburied coughs can lead to a distance of up to 15 feet [4.5 m] (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 mtres).
Some have raised the possibility that the virus may be transmitted by small amounts of tiny particles that can be present during speech. Neurons may also be formed during breathing exhaling, including when speaking, even though the virus is usually not moving through the air.
Tea can sit in the mouths or noses of people nearby or may even be squeezed into the lungs.
Other medical procedures, such as introspection and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause respiratory infections to cool off and the result is air pollution.
It may also disappear when someone touches a infected area, which includes the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Or there is concern that it may be on the increase, the danger believes it is low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of an SARS-CV-2 infection by touching the mouth after contact with the sewage. The virus has the risk of a close contact during the first three days when symptoms appear even though the spread may occur before symptoms appear and the final stages of the disease.
People were diagnosed with a virus up to three days before symptoms could develop that indicate that transmission could occur before major symptoms were developed.
Only a few reports of unprovable examples have been verified by the website, but unsigned exchanges have been documented during a survey of communications.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not clear how easily spread the disease, one person often infects another two or three others. The virus continues to live for hours to more than things.
Pointedly, the virus is found to reach three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 in stainles stateel, one day on the cards, until four hours.
This, however, varies from temperature to temperature. Home animals and other animals who have believed have actually been found with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit a virus to humans, even though British nanotechnology commands man to wash his hands after touching animals, as after touching infected areas that may have infected people.
The Severe avate respiratory system system coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus, which began to be isolated from three people who had pneumonia in contact with a series of symptoms of respiratory infections in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the new SARS-CV-2 virus occur in a natural environment of coronaviruses. Without the human body, the virus dies with domestic nails, as it melts its outer protection. I SARS-COV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-COV.
It was due to the origin of the fusion from an animal.
Genetic research has revealed that the coronavirus naturally joins with the form Betacoronvirus, sub-form Sabecovirus (line B), and the sub-linege from the bats.
It's the same as 96% for the total number of samples of other bats. (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is a single concentration of amino acids that differs from certain chemical elements between bacteria from pangolins and those of humans.
All chemical comparisons to this day have found that it may be 92% of the original elements between the pangolinus and SARS-CV-2, which are not enough to prove that the pangolins are the middle-keeping.
The transmission of the virus may be obtained by seeing the symptoms, although the final confirmation appears at last by changing the transscription polymerase (rRT-PCR) of the crash or with a CT image.
Research that compares the PCR to the Wuhan CT has raised that the CT is far more sympathetic than the PCR, even though its appearance is lower, since many of its team pictures of other kinds of pneumonia and disease.
"From March 2020, the American College of Radioology has raised that "" CT should not be used for investigation or that it is the first screening process of COVID-19"."
WHO has published the SARS-CV-2, multi-printed RNA checks, first published in 17 January.
A test is using a re-time cycle transfer polymerase special action (rT-PCR).
A test can be made through breathing samples or blood.
The results are usually found within a few hours of the day.
This test is usually made by a swapharyngeal swab of the throat can also be used. A number of moths and companies promote natural dyeing, which is capable of finding antibodies.
Since 6 April 2020, none of these have been advanced as well as adequate to be entitled to use everywhere.
In the US, the automation test sponsored by Cellex is authorized to be used in emergency situations by libraries only with certificates.
Image properties for radiographs and computers tomography (CT) for people who display symptoms include Asymmetric peripheral great screens for glass slides and abserial gear.
The Italian radic Society combines the universal online database to be found with approved models.
Because of the exposure to other diseases such as adenovirus, taking pictures without confirming PCR has a limited degree in pointing to COVID-19.
A great study in China compared the effects of CT and PCR's chest and showed that although the image has a small degree of communication, it is faster and more sympathetic, which raises the view of testing as a test tool in the pidemic areas of the epidemic.
Natural web sites based on non-translators have been developed so that they can examine the properties of bacterial images with both radiographs and CT.
Antiviral measures include keeping your personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or coughing with a towel and putting the towel directly into the trash.
Those who may already have found out are encouraged to wear a face mask in public.
Various governments have imposed restrictions on the travel of travel to or from countries affected by a disaster.
Yet, the virus has reached the point where it has become a global epidemic in parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some public members do not know where it is infected, and health workers who care for someone who may be infected are encouraged to use a set method of caution, alertness of contact, and protection of the eyes. Follow the affected course of the health authorities see the source of interaction and prevent further interaction.
The use of a piece of space from the nose from the state for this purpose has removed the concern of privacy, the Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations produce a statement that invites limits in this view.
There are already a number of anti-conservative approps, and since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen team of professionals working on joint and private solutions, such as using Bluetooth to install a log for the user's close contact to other mobile-box companies.
Users can now receive a message when it happens to be close to someone who has been tested to have a COVID-19. There are roundly conflicting views of safety methods; for example, to clean the nose and worrisome with mouthash is not effective.
There is no problem for COVID-19, even though many organizations are working on it.
Hand washing is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially when you walk out of the toilet or the waists appear dirty; before eating; and after brushing, coughing, or coughing.
The reason for this is that outside the human body, the virus is killed by the home soap, because it burns its protective knife.
The CDC also encouraged the use of alcohol-based satizer and at least 60% of alcohol with volume if soap and water are not available at that time.
WHO encourages people to avoid touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Areas can be dumped with a few solutions (between one minute of exposure to steroids ), including 62–71% of ethanol, 50–100% of isopanol, 0.1% of sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% of hydrogen peroxide, and 0.5% of hotdone-iodine.
Some solutions, such as basalconium chloride and chroxedine Glucote, work at a lower rate.
The CDC recommends that if the COVID model is suspected or confirmed in such places as office or day care, all places such as offices, toilets, general facilities, operating systems such as libraries, lockers, boards, remote controls, and ATM devices that patients have used, it must be killed by germs.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a cough or a cough when coughing, or taking a sneeze, and then discard any fly immediately.
The surgical masks are aimed at those who may be absorbed, since wearing a mask puts a limit on the amount and the rate of breathing joints come out when you speak, pause, and cough.
WHO has issued guidelines about the time and method of using a mask.
"As told by Stephen Griffin, avirologist at the University of Leeds," "Masking may reduce the tendency [to touch] people to touch the face, which is the greatest source of access without proper handwashing. "" Masks are also encouraged to be used by those who care for someone who may be ill."
WHO has promoted that nonpatient people can wear makeup only if they are in high risk, such as those who care for a COVID-19 person, even though they agree that wearing makeup can help people avoid having face contact.
Many countries have begun promoting the use of masks.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing a fabric mask rather than using a health one. China has directly recommended that non-patient members use discarded health masks, especially when you are close to one another at least three metres (3 ft) or below) with other people.
Hong Kong encourages wearing a surgical mask when taking public transportation or sitting in full areas.
Health workers in Thailand are encouraging people to make sneaks in their homes and clean them all day long.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia officially closed the public entrance without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask when she went to public places to protect herself and others.
The Austrian government decreed that everyone who enters the restaurant should wear a face mask.
Israel asked all citizens to wear a ruler mask when they were in the community.
Taiwan, as it has continued to produce ten million masks a day from the middle of March, asking train passengers and city buses to wear their visible masks in 1 April.
Panama has made it difficult to wear the face mask whenever you go out, at the same time encouraging to build up a face mask at home for those who cannot buy your face masks.
Facial masks have been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social isolation (also known as physical isolation) includes steps to control the link intended to aggravate the spread of the disease by reducing close contact with people.
Roads include divisions; travel barriers; and closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, tractors, and shopping centers.
Individuals may be able to use isolated means by living in homes, getting to visit, avoiding crowded places, greeting without contact, and physically separating themselves from others.
Many governments are now forcing or encouraging social Distancing in those areas.
A high number of unions raised by the US government and health agencies were suddenly reduced to 250 persons (if there was no increase in COVID-19 area), it was put in 50 perople, and later reached 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany officially closed a community gathering of more than two persons. The aged and those with such health conditions as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, asthma, and fallen soldiers are facing the risk of serious illness and problems and the CDC warned them to stay in the homes as much as possible in the morning 2020, WHO and other health branches began using the term 's physical separation' instead of that 'vaganization', so that it may be clear that the desire to reduce physical activity at the same time is kept in contact with each other.
"Social isolation" and then lead to the conclusion that people must have a full share in social isolation, may encourage them to continue communicating with others in different ways. Some authorities have produced guidelines for sexual health that can be applied while the plague continues.
These include sexual urges only to share sexual feelings with a roommate, who does not have a virus or symptoms.
The separation from home is encouraged by those who have received COVID-19 and those who suspect that they may be in danger.
Many governments have imposed or even promoted door - to - door surveillance by health - care professionals, so that there is widespread lack of privacy within the home.
The most heavy precautions to shut up at home are delivered by those in the most vulnerable groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently visited the country or a widely distributed district have been encouraged to close for 14 days from the time it is likely to be the final diagnosis.
Tactics to control the epidemic are closing or suppressing, and reducing.
Coverage is followed in the first stages of the epidemic and is intended to search out and separate those who are involved and that other joint - control programs and solutions are developed to prevent the spread of the disease and to other people.
If it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are being made to reduce the rate: steps are taken to slow down the spread and reduce its effects in health - care and community.
Avoiding both closed - and down measures may be followed at the same time.
Stress requires extreme measures to slow down the epidemic by reducing the slowest birth rate to less than 1. Part of the care for the outbreak of infectious disease is to try to reduce the top of the epidemic, which is known as diagnosing the line of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk that health services are found to be frustrated and allows more time for medicines and remedies to be developed.
Prescription interventions that can control outbreaks include personal protective measures, such as hand - washing, masking, masking, social measures that are intended to isolate physically like closing schools and exposing public events; participation in encouraging the community to accept and take part in such interventions; and so are natural measures such as cleaning up areas. The more drastic measures were taken in China when the growth level of growth is clear, such as closing up cities, and breaking off antimiscesion laws.
Other countries have also come up with various measures intended to limit the spread of infection.
South Korea has opened public sight and made closed territories, and has issued warnings of the movements of those in attendance.
Singapore has been disabled by financial support for those who have been trapped and forced high wages on those who have failed to do so.
Taiwan has raised the production of its own masks and has put the sentence of abuse on medical facilities. Great Britain and the United States mimicking shows that the reduction (inflammation but not to stop the expansion of the epidemic) and the pressure (to slow down the growth of the epidemic) is a major challenge.
The main reduction laws may reduce the serious need for health care by 2/3 and a half, yet the end is the death of hundreds of thousands and the frustration of health programs.
Pressure may be better but it needs to be kept as long as the virus continues to surround the human community (or until the solution is found, if that occurs first), as transmission rises rapidly when steps are released.
Prolonged exposure to pestilence exacts a heavy toll on society and its economic system.
There are no specific drugs to fight COVID-19, but efforts to build them are on the way, including testing existing drugs.
Taking medication from stores, drinking liquids, and resting may help ease the symptoms.
Depending on the weight, the treatment of the air, the liquid taken, and the support of breathing may be necessary.
Using steroids may cause the results.
Many elements that have been authorized for the operation of other growing diseases are studied to be used in treating COVID-19.
"WHO also issued that some "old and home medicines" are capable of performing relief from these symptoms of SARS-COV-19."
To raise the strength and balance of health care according to the need for COVID-19 patients is raised by WHO as an emergency response response.
The ECDC and the European Regional Revival of WHO have issued medical procedures and health care services that are not held in various categories, which include emphasis on rabbinic activities in studying COVID-19, to clear out the options where possible, to distinguish and distinguish established COVID-19 patients, and to increase the quality of care by monitoring personnel and increasing the number of breathing and beds.
Opinions vary as to the origin of the first example (productive to the egg patient).
The first known example of a new coronavirus goes back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of examples of Coronavirus in Hubei slowly rose.

"" The government of Iran is under great pressure by this virus, as there are at least twenty-four member of parliaments who are involved with twenty-five current or older politicians."
The president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, writes heads of countries asking for help on 14 March 2020, his country is struggling to fight this jealousy because of the inability to reach the world’s market markets against the Iranan. This trend led to recommendations that the United States has been made to accept the social goals considered by other prosperous nations, to take care of the needs of children in general health, to take care of the needs of the children, to take a family’s retirement from the U.S.
Political analysts hoped that it might affect Donald Trump’s success again in the 2020 ’ s with the election of Presidential presidents. The political alliances between Japan and South Korea would have been particularly dangerous.
"South Korea has criticized Japan "" for the criminal efforts of the people" after Japan declared that anyone from South Korea will be held in detention for two weeks at the designated offices."
In the beginning, the South Korea community has been quite divided by ideas about the reaction of President Maon Jae-in to this crisis.

The outbreak of the coronavirus is blamed on the lack of certain items as a result of the increased use of machines is also due to the eruptions, impulse buying, and long - standing problems of production and transport.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings against the shortage of legal drugs and medical equipment because of an increase in the demand for buyers and intervention on customers.
A few areas have seen the sudden purchase of items leading to the slowdown of basics such as food, toilet, and commercial water that has resulted in a shortage of necessary items.
The technology industry has been warning of the delay of transport of electrical goods.
According to WHO Secretary of Defense Theor, the need for personal safety has increased by 100 times.
This demand has led to an increase in numbers to a mere 20 times the average number of buying and a minimum of medical facilities in four to six months
It also creates a worldwide lack of personal protective equipment and even a Who warn that this endangers the health benefits of medical workers.
Australia, the plague created a new opportunity for the daigou merchants to sell Australian products to China
The reality of this has created a shortage of bottle food for children in some large stores by the Australian government has now closed it. Despite the high degree of the Ovid-19 disease in North and Italy and the Wuhan region and the greater demand for subsequent food, both areas have had no major food shortage.
China and Italy’s steps against the gathering and export of the most important items have been successful and prevented from the anticipated food shortage in Europe and North America
Northern Italy with its abundance of agriculture has not seen a major decline, but according to those who represent the industry, prices may rise.
The absence of food utensils was temporary even in the town of Wuhan, and in China, government officials let the fish in their pockets to ensure the livelihood of the inhabitants.
Similar laws are available in Italy that require those who undergo surgery to meet emergency situations.
In China, according to media reports on 16 March 2020, China’s economy was seriously shattered in the first two 2020 months because of government measures to stop the increase of the virus, which was bought in stores by 205%

A laboratory examination of the coronavirus wave 2019 Cavid-19 and the SARS-COV-2 virus related to it combine ways to detect the presence of a virus and those that see antibodies appear as a result when a person jumps.
The presence ofviruses in bytes is verified by RT-PCR that sees the presence of cronavirus RNA.
This research is specially designed to evaluate the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
It is used to ensure a recent or current diagnosis of disease.
An antibodies, siology, can be used either for a person's diagnosis or for a commission.
Antibody studies show how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated or without any symptoms.
The accurate number of deaths in this disease and the extent of human inequality in society can be traced to the results of this test.
As a result of the estimates, by March 2020, no countries had reliable statistics on the number of viruses in their society.
By March 23 no country had checked more than 3% of the people in their countries, and there is a significant difference in the number of surveys that have been conducted in various countries.
These differences may have a profound impact on reported death rates that may have occurred in a number of countries.
With the use of re-time transfer polymerase special action, rt-PCR, this check can be made on respiration frames obtained in various ways, including nasophargal sabb or sputum structure.
The results are usually found between two hours and 2 days.
A study called RT-PCR by throat swabbs can be trusted only in the early church with the disease.
In the future, the virus may disappear from the throat but continues to increase in the lungs.
For people who have an vaccinated second week, another copy of the steel mattress can be removed from the bottom of the steaming methods or by coughing the mattressal, sptuum, can be used.
Some of the first PCR scans were developed in the Crimes in Berlin in January 2020 with the use of re-time transscription polymerase right-action,irT-PCR, which provides the basis for the spreading of 250,000 kitchens by the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom had also developed a method of testing on 23 January 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed the PCR-based SARCV-2 Kit for a medical checkup on January 28,20.
"I" Egene" the same on all the beta coronaviruses and RdRp form found only in SARS-CV-2. In China, the BGI Group was one of the companies that received permission for the National Products Administration to use PCAR-based SARV-2. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, distributes 2019-Novel Cornary, Novel-R, Nol-re-rel-R-R, Rental-Rssssational Project on the application of research.
Three genetic test tests in the old ways of experimented tests caused some unclear results because of poor CDcons and limited screening in Atlanta, which resulted in less than 100 frames a day effective throughout February 2020.
The testing was not found to be reliable until 28 February 2020 and until that time when national and local research stations were allowed to begin testing.
This method of testing was authorized by Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Administration. Self-constitution test started early in March 2020.
On 5 March 2020 the TabCorp announced the international availability of COVID-19 surveys based on RT-PCR
The Queen Diagnostics, in turn, made the COVID-19 available from 9 March 2020
No mathematical limit was announced, the gathering and digesting of Specins should be done according to the CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR
On 11 February 2020 this method was registered by the Federal Service for Survey in HealthCare. On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed the type of COVID-19. In 13 March 2020, the Roche Diagnos received permission for the FDA for testing within 3.5 hours, thus allowing one computer to make 4128 tests in 24 hours.
In 19 March 2020, the FDA has issued the Abbot Laborories mandate of critical times, the EU, to investigate the Abott m2,000 policy, the FDA has previously given the Hologic, the Lamb Corp and Thermo Fisher Scientific license.
On 21-March 2020, the Cephheid likewise won the EU with a FDA form of testing type that takes about 45 minutes.
FDA has allowed the type of test using the ISOMal nuceic acid substance substance in place of PCR.
Because this does not require a series of temperature and heat cycles, this type can provide a postitive effect in just five minutes and negatives in 13 minutes.
At present there are approximately 18,000 devices in the U.S. and Abbott is expected to raise its performance to do some 50,000 tests a day. Tests using monoclon antibody especially adhere to nucleopsid protein, Nprotein, novel connavirus are being developed in Taiwan in hopes that it may be possible to produce results in 15 to 20 minutes like influenza.
"Repetition of March 2020 has concluded that "" cardographics do not make such a difference in the first paragraphs and that CT, computer tomography, may exist before the symptoms of the disease begin to occur."
Common CT elements include bilateral multibular Volume-glas epolis with peripheral, amymetritic posterior responsible.
Subpleulal performance, crazy heal and console grow as the disease changes itself.
A PCR comparison with the Wuhan at the site of the epidemic suggests that CT is more sympathetic than PCR but does not have details, many of which are related to other pneumonia and disease procedures.
"By March 2020, the American College of Radioology recommends that "CT" may be used to sort or test COVID-19 first" by March 2020, the CDC encourages PCR in the first death""" "
Part of the munse in the treatment of the disease is the production of antibodies including Igm and IgG.
These can be used to monitor the presence of the disease from 7 days or more, in order to identify the absence and employment of the community. Assays can be made up of major screening centers, GLTs, or by point-of-caring, PCT.
A high rate of automad systems in most medical research centers will be able to work with chess but their availability will depend on the vine for each of its production.
With CRL, we are uniquely single-specimin for peripheral blood used, even though sericimins are not used for the reactions of the body soldiers.
By PCT, a single blood-specimin is usually obtained through a tanning of the skin.
In contrast with PCR methods, shooting action is not necessary before work. On 26 March 2020, FDA introduced 29 terms that reported this act as necessary and now are able to distribute antibody testes.
For 7, April 2020, only one method of testing is allowed for the FDA under the supervision of critical conditions. By the end of March 2020, the Euroimiium Medical Laboratory Diagnoses and Epitome Diagnos found the approval of its European Test ignos who could test to see the IgG and IGA antivirus on the blood cells.
The amount of testing is several hundred sets of frames during the hour and is much faster than the International PCR pattern of the Visual RNA.
The presence of antibodies is usually diagnosed after 14 days of diagnosis. In April, the UK found that not one of the antibody statistics he bought would be effective.
"Hong Kong is a program in which patients are suspected may stay at home," "a host of emergency conditions that will give the patient some specimen tube", in order to pump it back and receive the results after a while. The British NHS has announced that it is starting a program of home tests that reduces the patient’s risk of infection when the patient goes to the hospital or the need to clean up the patient’s disease if there is a operation. Concerning the patient’s disease at COVD-19, a health worker will take advantage of the use of appropriate treatment."
South Korea has helped South Korea to make a more rapid, more focused surveys in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Emergency Health Investigation Physicians spoke on 2 March, stating that there were some 12,000 studies per day in the flood system and a survey of 10,700 had been conducted in the past week.
The cost is measured by health insurance when a medical examination is called by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the power to include 160,000 surveys per week.
Since March 19 a driving test was given in many large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total total number of German surveys is not known, since only the correct results are reported.
"The first survey of the library showed that from the 12-20th week of the calendar, the total number of samples of 483,225 were checked and included 12/20 and 33.491 samples[.9] during the survey she confirmed SARS-CV-2. Israel, researchers at the Technion and Ramm Hospital and studied how to examine 64 patients at the same time, only by including samples and more when a sample had been approved.
Since the building was still occupied by the BGI founder Wang Jian and took 5 days, the modeling shows that the examples in Hubei would be up to 47% and the necessary cost to meet the arrest would be twice as long as the ability to include unsupervised testing was not available in time.
The Wuhan Republic is quickly followed by the tables of Huo-Yan in Shenzhen, Tinjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities throughout China.
From 4 March 2020 a total of daily transmissions to some 50,000 studies per day. The open source, the sophisticated drawings released by Origami Asssays has been opened to enable them to check the samples of many patients until 12121 in COVID19 only are used for only 93 sassions. These synthetic drawings can operate in small libraries without the need of boilers.
Since March, the shortage and insufficient number of reagents has become a major factor in testing the majority between the EU and the UK and the US.
This has led some writers to examine the legal procedures for samples that involves a high degree of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release more RNA components. In March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now checking the number of their own people each head than in any other country, and it was moving at a good pace to the level of testing in order to reach a large portion of the population.
"This has been a combination of a combination of flow-sole-s scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on" Huo-Yan" in China."
Built in 14 days, the moth is able to direct tens of thousands of surveys by RT-PCR per day and the first in the world of this working measure without China.
Various methods of testing for the different types of coronavirus elements are built in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization chose a German system for auto manufacturing that was sent to countries where there was no money to build their own.
The German policy was published on 17 January 2020; a policy developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delayed the studies that were available in the United States. China and the United States faced the problems of autosuits early in the morning, and these countries and Australia were unable to build and produce enough tanks to satisfy the need and encourage health experts.
In contrast, experts say that the greater availability of surveys in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The power to include testing, especially in independent libraries, was developed over a period of many years by the government of South Korea.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the power of screening processes as the best way to breast - feed COVID-19. The high need for screening for the spread of the virus resulted in an increase in the production of hundreds of thousands of U.S. libraries independent, and the production of sabs and chemical reents was stressful.
In March 2020 China reported problems with the accuracy of its checks.
"In the United States, the CDC scans are found "" with errors" the government removed the law walls which had banned secretly. Spain bought tickets from the China Institute Shenzhen Bioey Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were wrong."
The company explained that the wrong results may be caused by judging the samples or using the stove in a proper way.
The Spanish Ministry said it was to release the kitchens that produced the wrong results, and it will put in their room a different kitchen built for Shenzhen Bioiesy. 80% of the Czech Republic checkpoints that bought them in China produce the wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million checks in China found to be accurate.
"Prime Minister Matovič rose up to be rejected by adding to the Danube. Ateş Cara of Turkish Health Ministry said Turkeywagate checkpoints in China were found "and they've not "used." "UK bought 3.5 million search boats in China but at the beginning of April 2020 proclaimed that they are not used."
Tests, followed by arrests of those found to ensure that they were checked and followed by those who had contact with people who had proved to be sure of the SARS-CV-2 checks, and the results were to be verified as well.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the first death point in Italy, directed two round surveys of 3,400 persons, at least ten days away.
At least half of the people who went to extremes during the survey had no symptoms, and all the examples found were locked up.
With the visit closes, this removes a completely new link.
In a subsequent series of enthusiastic victims, incoming visits are detected, testing, and shutting down, the 2020 Cronavirus epidemic in Singapore is going on with far greater efficiency than other developed countries, but without such difficult limits as the closing of food stores and other markets.
Many events have been announced, and Singapore has begun to advise citizens to stay at home on 28 March, but schools opened at a time after vacation on 23 March.
A number of countries have also been able to care for the plague by eager follow-up, by means of internal travel, checks, and screening, but to a small degree in low - lying, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistics have found that countries who studied more closely, compared with the number of dead, have lower rates of deaths, which may be due to the fact that they are in a better position to search out those with or without symptoms at all.
WHO recommends that the countries who have no access capacity and have national libraries with limited experience with COVID-19 and send sure first and 10 active samples to the COVID-19 of the 16 trusted libraries of WHO will confirm the search.
Of 16 reliable libraries, 7 are Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the next row, the 'Visual % test' has been influenced by the country checker' policy.
A country that inspects only those who are admitted to hospitals will have many assured by % of a survey than a country examining all its citizens, whether they show signs or not, some things are equal.
To wash your hands (or washing your hands), also known as hand washing, handwashing with the intention of removing the soil, glass, small objects, or towels that are not required.
Washing hands with soap regularly in those ‘ critical times ’ during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which combine with oral waste.
People can also contribute to respiratory infections such as colds or ordinary colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, symptoms that have not yet developed).
The five crucial periods during the day when soap washing is essential include: front and back after discharge, after washing the diapers or changing the diapers, before and after feeding the baby, before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, inside, and after preparing the food.
Before and after treating a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning the child who uses the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing, or coughing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal waste.
Hand hygiene refers to hygienic measures that have to do with medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or a treatment can protect or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main purpose of hand - washing is to wash your hands by washing the hands of potassiums (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is a vital procedure even for the common man.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of colds, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; to protect against the common causes of diarrhea; to reduce respiratory infections;
and reducing the mortality rate of infants at home.
The 2013 survey showed that advanced handwashing process may lead to less development during the development of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of young people associated with respiratory infections and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as by washing hands with soap.
A simple action may reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by about 50%.
Surgical techniques that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea in three ways, and this can be compared to operating clean water in poorer areas.
The reduction of diapers in 48% can be linked to soap washing. Washing hands with soap is one method that works well and is less expensive to protect the diarrhea and respirations (ARI), such as an unusual behavior occurring in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
The main ARI, which leads alone as the cause of infant death under five years of age, is destroying the health of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
The diarrhea and pneumonia both contribute to about 3.5 million infant deaths a year.
According to UNICEF, converting hands to soap before and after using the toilet to become a strict routine can save more health than any single treatment or medical intervention, determining death for the cause of diarrhea and death from respiratory diseases in one part.
Handwashing is usually associated with other wasteways as part of the water, garbage and sanitation (WASH).
Handwashing also protects against emigration by direct contact.
A minor accident is the result of regular handwashing of skin damage caused by dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive handwashing can have a effect on drying, leathery skin known as dry iczema or long dermatitis, which is most common to people who are health - care workers.
Over and over again, hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of optical disorder (OCD).
There are five crucial times during the day when soap washing is necessary to reduce the transmission of the disease by means of oral hygiene: after use of the toilet (to wash, dismantling himself), after washing the diapers (ranning the nas), before or after feeding the baby, before or after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or birds.
Other times when proper handwashing should be followed in order to avoid the spread of disease includes both before and after treatment of injury or injury; after a sneeze, cough, or sneeze; after touching an animal’s faring or handling animals; and after handling dirt.
In many countries, there is a low level of soap - washing.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on the average, 38.7% of families follow the soap washing process. The 2011 survey showed that Saudi Arabia had a very high rate of 97 percent; the United States near the middle of 7 percent; and China at a very low level 23 percent. A few traditional practices are now in progress in accepting the practice of handwashing at critical times. To wash hands as a group of children in one of the developing countries.
The "Esentical Health Care Program" introduced by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the work of encouraging child health and education.
Twice a year, accompanied by regular washing of hands with soap, daily massage with fluoride, is a national policy support.
It is also successfully started in Indonesia.
Removing microorganism from the skin is better equipped with soap or water cleaning.
The main work of soap and cleaning is to reduce the obstacles to the solution, and to raise the soluability.
Water is not enough to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are soil structures, are not easily dehydrated in water.
But cleaning helps in a degree of flow of water.
Snuff, since it is able to function again, may keep the bacteria from working ahead.
A small number of studies that monitor the transmission of the virus from a tiny dish found in the feces conclude that it is impossible to keep bacteria clean and toxic.
The CDC still continues that the "soil-washing and handling without hands is better."
Antiviral soaps are highly advertised by health - care communities.
To this day, there is no evidence that using antiseptics or proposed antisibictants is a choice of natural antibiotics.
However, antibacterial soaps have normal antibacterial representatives such as tricrosan, which contains a long list of resistant scientists.
Thus, even if antibiotic resistant stations are not selected for antibacterial soap, they may be able to function properly in the manner it is sold.
Otherwise the surfact and the representative of the skin, complex structures may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, acetic acid) as management of pH, antivibibilily bezoic acid, and other skin cares (aloe vera, vitamin, etc. A study of the University of Oregon School of Public Health) showed that non-infictal products are effective in the same way that they do to prevent germs.
Hot water with which to wash your hands does not burn them properly in order to die of germs.
Germs grow especially when the temperature of a hole is 37 degrees Fahrenheit [37 ° C].
Yet, warm, soapy water works better than cold water, which contains soap from natural fats that absorb soil and germs.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not contribute to reducing microbial lead in the hands.
The uninitizer or unicode antiseptic is a symbol of water-made hand-cleaning.
At the end of the 1990 ’ s and early part of the 21st century, the representative of the clean-arming hands of alcool drills (also known as alcohol-bed ubbs, anti-innizers, or manizers) began to gain a high voice.
Many based on the sopropyl alcohol or ethanol that was grown together with a hot representative like Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) made it a channel, or simetant as glycerin, or foam to make it easier to use and reduce alcohol thirst.
Adding hydrogen-peroxide increases the production of antimicrobials. Handnitizer with alcohol 60 to 95% successfully kills bacteria.
Alcohol rub sanitizer kills bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), Tuberculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, varicia, influenza, and hepatitis).
Alcohol rubies with 70% of alcohol kills 99.97% (3.5 log), as well as 35 decibels in reduced) of hand infections in the hands in 30 seconds after swallowing and 99.99% to 99.99% of the microorganics (1 to 5 kg) of bacteria in the hands of 1 minute after urinating. Handnizers works well and works slowly on certain bacteria.
An alcohol-geniter might be virtually inactive to nonrovirus (or Norrolk) type of bacteria, the main cause of estroterititis. A sufficient anti-intensed anti-inform or alcohol rub should be used to soften completely or cover both hands.
The front and back of both the hands and the back of the fore-and-aft hands are rubbed around about 30 seconds until the liquid, the foam or the cell is dry.
The fingers must be washed with them, rubbed on both hands. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention encourages washing hands rather than shaking hands with sanitizers, a great stride when the hands are obviously clean.
The rise in the use of these representatives is due to their quick performance and quick energy to kill micro-organisms; however, they should be used to take the proper place of the hands unless soap and water are not available.
A regular use of alcohol - based sanitizers can cause dry skin except when alligatings and/or skin braces are inserted.
Alcool thirst process can be reduced or eliminated by inserting glycerin and/or enzymes in combination.
In a medical study, alcolics based on almollies make more good skin and dryer than soap or antimicrobials.
Alergic content data, contricular or hypertensity to alcool or aductive that is present in non-alcol flow rubbs.
The lower condition of causingrt point numbers is more appealing when compared with the washing of hands with soap and water.
Regardless of their effectiveness, waterless ambassadors cannot wash their hands in natural matter, but they only kill germs.
For this reason, the big sanitizers do not function properly as soap and water to protect the spread of many ethogens, as the pathogens continues to be in their hands.
The success of non-Alcohol-subs has much to do with the ingredients and interactions, and in record they are more efficient than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, the combination of the basalconium chloride has shown the persistence and increase in the work of antiviral after anointing, in contrast with alcohol, which is shown to reduce function after repeated activity, may be the cause of continued skin reactions.
Many people in economically poor communities cannot buy soap and make use of ash or soil instead.
The ash or soil may function better than the water, but it does little more than the soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash detects the contamination of micro-organisms may raise the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a agent that eliminates the virus because when it is mixed with water, a mixture of alkaline is formed.
WHO encourages ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
The appropriate handwashing process recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for Prevention of Transmission of Disease include these steps:
Fill your hands with warm or cold water.
The flow of water is encouraged because standing heaters may be contaminated, while the temperature or temperature of the water makes the difference.
Wash your hands with adequate soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people often do better to wash their hands when soap is available than when using only water.
Pause at least 20 seconds.
Flirtation produces heat, helps remove bacteria from the skin, and prolongs time sucking more bacteria.
Clean up under running water.
Washing your hands in front of your face may do little or no harm
You stop with a clean towel or allow the air to dry.
Drought and thin hands take for granted the garbage. The easily forgotten places are the thumb, the thumb, the thumb, the middle of the fingers, and under the nails.
Piercing nails and rusted nail polylish can store microorganisms.
A winnowing lead is often encouraged to keep your hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can cause infection.
Different inexpensive procedures can be made to meet hand washing when water pumps and/ or soap is not available. To pump water by placing an appropriate vessel or drum and/or use a pipe if needed for developing countries. In areas with limited water (such as schools or rural areas in the developing countries), there are some useful methods of water conservation, such as "tippy-taps" and other forms of insurance.
Tippy-tap is a simple device for using a whip tied with a rope, and a foot-pass that gives little water to the hands and a soap bowl.
A effective handwashing is an important part of the process of handwashing, but there is a dispute over the best method of drying in public areas.
A growing number of studies suggest that paper towels are better cleaner than electric gases found in cleaning areas.
In 2008, a study was directed by the University of Westminster, London, and supported by the European Tissue Symposium firm, to compare the level of cleanliness found in paper cans, hot - air dry hands, and late - air dry hands.
After washing and drying hands with hot gases, the total number of bacteria was found to be rising at the rate of the fingers by 19% and at hand by 254%.
Steering with high airmains was effective at the total number of bacteria in the fingers by 42% and at hand by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria fell on the perimeter by 76% and at the fingers by 7%. Scientists also took a study that would produce a chance of joining the hygiene staff and cleaning facilities as a result of each method of drying.
A fast, air-cushion, air-cushion from it at a fixed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to avoid micro-organisms in their hand and nearly join other users in the cleaning area about 2 metres.
The use of hot air has laid the micro-organisms up to 0.5 feet [0.25 m] from the boiler.
The paper towels did not show the apparent decomposition of micro-organisms. In 2005, a search guided by TÜV Produk undwelt, the different laying methods were checked.
The following change in the number of bacteria after the laying of the hands was observed:
There are many art producers available, and hand saws have been compared to drying by hand.
Washing hands using raw sanitings is another way when you are traveling in a journey of soap and water.
An alcohol-coniter might have alcohol at least 60%.
Medical washing was long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis found his work (1846) in preventing disease in the hospital.
There are electric generators that operate by markings to remind hospital workers to wash their hands when they forget them.
One study found a reduction in disease levels by means of performance.
Medical washing takes about 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or cane to anoint or rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed together through the fingers.
If there is uncleanness under the nails, the crystal bush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can sit in the water in the hands of the hands, it is essential to clean up and dry up with a clean towel.
After the drying, the paper towel must be used to shut down water (and open any exit door if possible).
This avoids wasting your hands again in those places.
The idea of washing hands in the care condition is to remove the thogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid taking them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that permissive handwashing continues to continue to be unacceptable in many medical areas, with a large number of doctors and nurses continually forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus passing on microorganisms.
One study showed that hand washing in a manner and other simple procedures can reduce the level of cattheter-reated blood abuse by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a chart showing handwashing and washing hands in the field of health care.
The organizational instructions for handwashing can be found in its own library so that the public can observe them.
The necessary replacements were directed by the Witby et al.
Stores can measure and ensure hand-cleaning, when demonstration and compliance with the law is required.
The World Health Organization has "five times" to wash hands:
after a blood transfusion/blood flow
before the actual operation of an objectptic, once
and after the care of the patient. Applying anti-inflammatory chemicals ("to the herbicide" or soaps "protective microbes") gives the power to kill in such handwashing.
That power may be required before surgery or in cases where antibiotic-restant orgries are plentiful. 'Plowing' for someone' of the surgical work, it is necessary to have a pump that can be opened and closed without touching by hands, chlorhedy or iodine ash, sterile towels to dry up after washing, and a sterile brush, and another sterile washing in the feet.
All the fittings must be removed.
This procedure requires hand and arms washing to the compartment, usually 2-6 minutes.
The length of searching time (10 minutes) is not required.
When you do, the water in the arm should be stopped without running back to the hands.
After completing the washing of hands, hands are stopped by a metal cloth or a surgical garment is worn.
To reduce the spread of infection, it is best to wash the hands or use handrails before and after treatment.
To control staphylocoal diseases in hospitals, it has been found that great gain from clean hands comes from the first 20% of the first cleaning, and that there is very little extra help available when repeated handwashing is raised over 35%.
Sweeping with the empty soap has a three-fold effect of a foodborne disease compared to cleaning with a hot-bobing soap solution. To compare the hand-bobing with alcohol-bobing ishing with an antibacterial substance for a metaconicial time of 30 seconds.
But soap and water function better than alcohol-bed hambs in reducing H1N1 influenza A vilirus and Clorridic disorder in the hands. In order to improve hand hygiene in health care conditions may include teaching workers by washing their hands, raising the availability of alcohol-bad rund hab, and reminders written and said to the staff.
There is a need for further research that investigates which of these methods of intervention works best in different health - care conditions.
In developing countries, soap - washing is recognized as a means of saving, an important means of achieving good health, and even physical nutrition.
Yet, a lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in people’s homes, schools, and workplaces makes it a challenge to reach the world’s hand - washing habits.
In many African villages, for example, handwashing pumps near private or public toilets are scarce, even though there are no shortcuts for building handwashing.
Yet, low hand washing rates may be a more serious reason than that of lack of soap or water.
Advertising and standing for soap - washing can also contribute to legal measures, raise caution for handwashing, and lead to a change in society’s routine.
For this to be effective, vigilance and order are essential.
A careful review of 70 surveys found that the methods based on community use to raise hands to LMICs, while social advertising campaigns do little work. One example of advertising to wash hands in schools is UNICEF' "The Three Stars" which encourages schools to take simple, protective measures to ensure that students clean their hands with soap, during other requirements of hygiene.
When small amounts are reached, schools may range from one to another and eventually from three stars.
Construction of handwashing can be part of a program that sells hand washing to reduce disease and death for infants.
The World's Day of Hand Washing is one of the examples of a campaign that raises caution in an effort to achieve a change of habits. As a result of the 20th - 20 scourge of the connavirus epidemic, UNICEF advertised the widespread use of the manual cleaning.
A few studies have considered the total cost of handwashing in developing countries and the interaction and prevention of DALYs.
One return, however, does raise the point that selling soap - washing is more expensive than running water and vomiting.
The importance of washing one’s hands — especially for people under the weak conditions such as newly brought babies or injured soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid - 19th century by two hand - hand cleaners: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale.
At that time many people still believed that disease was caused by bad smells called maasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks from food and medical - related diseases led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to advertise more hand washing as an important means of preventing the spread of disease.
The outbreak of blue flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 during 2020 has led to higher caution in many countries on the importance of soap washing in defense of this type of infectious diseases.
For example, posters have the inscription "proper handwashing procedure" placed up near a washroom in public toilets and private rooms in offices and airports in Germany.
The expression "Clean your hands" means to make clear to someone not want to take responsibility for something or get involved in it.
Its roots are part of the Bible in Matthew’s account when Pontius Pilate washed his hands in making a decision to impale Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth's Macbeth, we first forced her to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up the thought, which represents a guilty conscience concerning the crimes she had committed and has persuaded her husband to do it.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or thinking about wrong acts, often wash their hands more often than others, and tend to appreciate the importance of handwashing.
Moreover, when they are not allowed to wash their hands afterward they are less likely to participate in "cleaning" activities, such as volunteerism.
Religion encourages the washing of hands by both pure and symbolic purposes. For example to wash hands, using water, but without soap to wash hands, it is part of the process of washing hands in many religions, including Bahha'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and tethlat dating in Judaism, Lavavo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also encourage hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam call for handwashing after use of the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam force to wash their hands before and after meals.
COVID-COVID-19
Risk controls instead of the COVID-19 to the use of ocuctional safety and Health safety procedures to prevent Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper risk controls in the workplace depend on the working environment and the type of work, by supporting the risk of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risks to the individual personnel who may be weakened in avoiding COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Officeal Safety and Health Administration (OSH), risk - free jobs have a lower level of public contact with the public and other employees, which is that simple protective measures are encouraged, including hand washing their hands, encouraging employees to stay in the home when they are sick, and to maintain good breathing habits, and to keep the treatment of germs in the workplace.
Risk - related activities include those that require constant contact and are close to people who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but they may be infected because of ongoing social interaction or foreign travel.
This includes employees who can contact the common people like schools, crowded labor, and crowded market conditions.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to simple protective measures, include high-efficiency antifilters, sneeze guards, and a pernitival processes available in situations where a person with COVID-19 is found.
The OSHA views health workers who are exposed to known people or suspected of having COVID-19 as a higher risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure if the workers make aerool-genating procedures, or take or handle phrimens from known people or suspects about COVID-19.
The necessary risk controls in these services include building controls such as negative pressure operations, and adequate auto-productive activity at work.
The outbreak of the*COVID-19 may have serious consequences within the work environment.
Employees may not be at work because of sickness, the need to care for others, or the fear of being exposed.
Marketing habits may change, both of which are necessary, with ways of obtaining these items (such as buying at relatively little time or by means of transportation or driving duties).
Finally, the transport of items from the hard-flood areas of COVID-19 may be interrupted. Preparation for a related disease and response program can be used to regulate safety activities.
Programs observe the risk factors involved in the various workplaces and types of employment, including the type of exposure, the risk factors rising at home or in public conditions, and the hazards of individuals as high age or of chronic diseases.
They also explain the proper control over those hazards, and the following programs may rise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparation for a infectious disease and response programs may depend on the promotion of national or regional law.
The aims of responding to an outbreak include reducing labor strikes among employees, protecting people at high risk of serious health problems, keeping business jobs, and reducing the serious consequences of other businesses and buyers.
The burden of disease in the community is a business that affects the measures taken.
The flight flight flight steps are a form of the software used widely in ocuctional safety and health to combine risk controls with results.
When the dangers of COVID-19 are not removed, the control that works best on building management, is followed by the control of handling, and finally the protection of personal safety.
Construction management involves separating workers from work - related accidents without trusting in the worker’s routine, and it can be a very expensive option when applied.
Changes in employment or procedures that require an employee or employer's action
Personalproductive activity (PPE) is more effective than building control and control control, but it can help avoid some exposure.
All types of PPE must be chosen based on the work accident, appropriately dressed as appropriate (eg, apricots), always dressed and in a manner, always checked, maintained, and changed, according to the need, and moved properly, cleaned, and kept or kept away from pollution.
According to the U.S. Officeal Safety and Health Administration (ORHA), low - defined jobs have little social contact with other age groups.
Simple measures of prevention at all workplaces include repeated and thorough washing of hands and, encouraging employees to stay at home when they are sick, good respiratory habits including covering coughs and sneezings, running errands and bottle - feeding products, preparing home - room work or stoves, encouraging employees to avoid using other tools and tools, and keep the process of cleaning and killing germs in the workplace.
Early detection and isolation of people who may be infected are an important step in protecting employees, customers, employers, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with antispiration signals should stay at home until they can no longer have heat, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using antidepression or conditioning drugs, and that the rules of the days of illness are demanding, allow workers to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that the staff know these rules.
According to the OSHA, the internally defined functions include those activities requiring regular or close contact with the six links (1.8 m) with unknown or even suspected cases of COVID-19, having the SARS-CV-2 virus because of continued tension in the community near the workplace, or because someone has recently returned from an outside world that has an increased contact with COVID-19.
These include employees who are connected with the general public as schools, high - pressure services, and high - pressure marketing conditions. Building executives of these high - risk groups include putting up high-level filterers, raising corporate limits, placing limits as platforms of plastic drills, and installing driver driver-projecting screens through driving systems. The management of the highly affected labor group includes encouraging patients to live in homes, transporting the network from active environments, including the control of the environment, which allows them to take off the control of the control of the system, which allows DS-CCPD, which will kill and self-to-to-to-inficulating devices, which they will kill their deadly radiation, which they will kill their deadly diseases, and kill them.
Workers in this group of exposure groups rarely need a respirator.
If a person begins to suffer from a lung disease, appropriate control programs for attack on employees and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a rate of 6 degrees, putting one crew member to care for the patient, and offering a face mask to the patient, or asking the patient to put his mouth and nose on his or her cough when he coughs or sneezes.
A shiver must wear gloves when caring for a sick passenger or affecting body fluids or areas that may be contaminated, and it may be more protective if the patient has a fever, a persistent cough, and a difficulty in breathing.
Flags and other missing items should be discarded with a biohasard bag, and contaminated areas should be cleaned up and installed later. In the case of merchant ships, including merchant ships and other transport ships, navigation control includes slowing travel when sick, and identifying them with a medical center immediately if someone begins to burn or other symptoms while on board.
If possible, a medical procedure must be affected by a separate school and day care center. In schools and stores, the CDC recommends temporarily screening and screening if a person with an infection has been inside a school building, regardless of the spread.
If there is little or no addition to the community, separation plans are likely to be started as flashing intofield trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as field education, tea classes or fasts, increased space between desks, arrivings and return hours, taking unnecessary visitors, and using a different health office area of children with symptoms of coldlike flulike symptoms.
When the virus spreads in a significant way to society, despite the efforts of people to separate themselves, it may be considered closed schools. For law personnel who perform daily tasks, the health risk at the time is considered lower by the CDC.
Legal personnel who must contact assured or suspected of having a COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as the medical personnel in emergency situations, including the right things for a person to protect.
If there is greater contact when a person is found, the workers should clean and remove germs from their work belts and clothes before reuse them with a spray or cleaning cloth, and follow the usual measures to prevent the spread of the virus and disposal of PPE used as well as the washing of clothes.
The OSHA estimates that some medical and weather workers are at greater or greater risk of exposure to disease.
The activities of the victims at great risk include those who send medical supplies, relief supplies, libraries, and medical personnel who are exposed to known patients or who suspect that they have COVID-19.
These are the greatest risk of exposure to disease when employees perform procedures that create aerosol, or collect or handle samples, from known patients or suspect that they have COVID-19.
The procedures that produce aerosol include the injection of tubes, inflammatory procedures, bronchoscopies, procedures and dental examinations, or body samples.
The activities of exposure to the most dangerous disease include personnel involved in preparing dead bodies for persons whose condition is known or suspect that they have COVID-19 when they die; these are a greater danger if they check out dead bodies. More occupations of these dangerous groups include separate living rooms for known patients or suspects that they have COVID-19, including where procedures are performed on aerosol.
A special air pressure with lead pressure can be suitable for some medical and temperature checkouts.
Samples should be handled with security guidelines for Biosity Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated from specialized waiting facilities by any suspicion of having COVID-19. In addition to the PPPE, the OSHA encourages helicopters to those who work far away from those who are known, or who have suspect, that they have the SAS-CV-2 virus, and those who practice aerool procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH should be used as a fully documented immune system, which includes a healthy examination, exercise, and medical examinations.
Some types ofrespilers can protect and improve the worker's mood. WHO doesn't encourage pollals, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than by transmission of body fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks to the surgical personnel in their entrance areas.
For those who collect smoke samples, care, or transport the COVID-19 without aerosol birth procedures, WHO encourages surgery masks, mirrors, or foce shieds, gauni, and gloves.
When aerosol introduction process is performed, N95 or FFP2 scan instead of surgery masks.
Because PPE is not available enough in the world, WHO encourages reducing the need for PPPE by telephone contact, physical preventions such as these show, which only allow those directly involved to enter a room with COVID-19, use only the needed PPE for a particular job, continue using the same extension without removing it while caring for many patients with the same disease, alerting and controlling the availability of PPE, and rejecting the use of masks.

CULTURAL: [Covid-19] Reduction and preparation for the future
DAY/ TIME TOMATE: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
RATIO: CC0: No rights taken
We find ourselves in a particular situation for this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear indication of how people in the world are connected with each other’s load.
We have never faced the same challenges, but we know that our reaction is largely based on the kind of empathy, cooperation, and community initiative that is at the root of the organization’s crisis.
The cooperation and care we have seen in all our employees through e - mails, telephones, and chats is a remarkable guarantee that we have good people with whom to work.
I am truly happy and proud to work along with you.
A week ago, someone told me how grateful he was for our work.
He reminded me of how logical it is for the world to be able to open Wikipedia right now, and this is a powerful symbol for this most important source to be found on the Internet and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep your personal records or that of your employees in financial or community.
The world needs the information available in Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when we do not only what we do but also how we do it, which will exert a powerful influence on the world around us.
Because of the importance of this work and your role in it, we will make significant changes in our relationship with each other down to this day.
Changes in our work and in the stock market
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team has met last evening and discussed how we are going to work with our cook for the days and months to come.
In that discussion, we have considered what we felt will be the best response to what we have to say and the best way to keep the organization going during this time.
We would not expect that we would want to relieve stress and support our long - term goal.
If you need to drive again, it is good.
Of all the workers, companies, and volunteer workers:
Our expected daily activity will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until the change is announced.
We do not preach a holiday if you are able to work longer hours, so a company can use it.
However, things are uncertain in the world now, and whether you have to care for loved ones, buy food, or go to a doctor, your health comes before us.
We will not pursue your work on time.
If you get sick, don’t go to work.
There is no really need to say that, but we will.
You don't have to install sick days or PTO - you will simply tell your supervisor and help your crew pack to reorganize the calendars and elevators to make sure that the main parts of the work are accomplished.
( If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Bryan among the T&C Ops so that T&C will be able to help you by supporting and ensuring that your condition is properly cared for by the management).
Hour - time workers will be fully paid.
We have already said it, and we are eager to fulfill our obligations to our employees and those working hours.
Everyone will be paid according to his regular working hours in normal conditions.
This includes sickness and disability.
If you want to work, we have to support you.
Many people use work as a means to cope with their stress.
What we do can have a wonderful reward, especially during times like this.
Once again, it is important to take care of yourself.
We invite you to contact your employer, so that we know what to expect and plan accordingly.
Some work is taken seriously.
There are things we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraiing (among others) are doing a serious task that may require more support.
We will start with the process and every door to analysis the current goals and to push aside our focus in supporting what is important in our goal.
All of us have to do, but we will all focus on the most important projects.
slowing down now will not harm us later.
We do not plan to "work again to hold the elevator" when the epidemic is over.
You would not be expected to work extra hours to complete the work at an unusual time in the near future.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work at setting new goals and new times when appropriate.
What happens to the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to change our new circumstances and the hours of the work we expected every day, we intended to change the mission of our electrical Plan of 2020-201.
Our aim is to suggest the development of our 20th-20s, which allows more time for allowing the staff to take on more work, care for themselves, and care for their loved ones while assisting those who need or wish to work less in the next few weeks.
This extension of the working period greatly reduces the present work schedule and pressures that it is concerned the rest of the organization.
We will introduce our request to Obed next week and restore representatives to the following steps as soon as we have the assurance.
Thanks to the APP team for taking the lead in this.
Office status, description, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF employees may be exposed to COVID-19 virus.
In great concern, however, we have sent a clean - up crew to remove germs from all areas of San Francisco’s office.
Use hospital soap for treating germs everywhere, as well as for reception rooms and evolving rooms.
The building uses its security protocol by using products that promote its continental defense.
We feel free to say that the office will be right when we decide to return.
Our DC office is in Werk, which has shared with us its COVID-19 government and all the DC workers.
From the past week, our DC office has moved to a remote area completely completed in harmony with the guidance provided by San Francisco.
As some of our NyC workers knew, we had always talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but may last for some time.
Some of our fellow workers were working far away for the first time.
Our longtime servants know that it would be a great change, and they want to give you some advice:
Keep meeting attendance at least an hour or two.
If longer meetings are needed, consider how you can separate them within a few days.
Make it clear what the meeting is about you, why don't delay, and send ahead of time the things that must be learned.
Always do so with a video, with devices such as Google Docs and Zoo so that you can work and communicate directly.
Get the person who will take the lead in preparing for all the meetings, someone who will look up the questions in the discussions, and someone who will help you make notes (or notes all of you).
Send e-mail to those who are currently supported by you if you need a valid backup file.
Use your living expenses to pay for expenses.
Sign #remotees to Black so you can talk to your friends about the work you are sending.
The HR Displays Committee needs guidance on the Internet network by effective methods of operation to support the increase in the work that is sent out to the rest of the company.
This past week we have asked all who receive less money in the community to highlight the social events supported by Wikimedia, such as the end of the epidemic, by WHO.
We have told them that we have come to understand that our request for more freedom and that it will not be possible to finish their recognized pension plans and that no one will be charged with a period of delay or change.
In the coming week we will follow further direction on Wikimania and other social and class colleges.
The general feeling of society in the world seems to be to be a depressed by disturbances but relief from the defined and possible focus on their communities, Wikimedia, and so forth.
In time, CRTC works to trace a page to Meta-Wiki to give a public space to see what effects it has on you and to follow our conversations with them.
To stay connected with issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar next Thursday, at 14.0 UTC/07:00 PT for a special labor assembly.
We will use the time to share return visits, answer your questions, and spend some time with each other.
We work together and will help you wherever we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive all the information in this email, along with all the related COVID-19 related information in the Office Wiki.
A CRTC that will keep these pages returned with all information from the same location.
We also work to keep regular contact with workers living in lands currently deeply affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, trade routes, the challenge of the library, and anything else you may need to help, please tell you and work with the CRTC.
We are here to help support and communicate when necessary.
If you have a confidential or serious matter, please send a e - mail to Bryan Juda - HR International Global Practices.
None of these changes should be viewed as leaving our work and obligations.
Rather, they are aware that at this very moment, our work and commitments will most likely need to be adjusted as never before.
These steps are believed to be necessary in order to support each other so that we can carry on the work, provide our group with the support they need, and provide a reliable guide for the earth.
The work we plan to do will be waiting for us when the time comes.
In the meantime, it is a time for mutual support and space for important work that may be available in the weeks and months to come.
We need both of you to do that, so we need to take care of you and of your families so that you will be fully prepared when the need arises.
Now, we beg -- stretch out your hands and don’t touch your face!

B'Angiotensen-convering enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an external enzyme (in the cell membrane) of the cells in the lungs, nerves, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 combats the function of angiotgen-conning enzyme (ACE) by reducing angiotsin-II and raising an Ag(1-7) as a promising treatment for heart and blood diseases. ACE2 also serves as an entry into certain coronvirus cells.
The human enzyme type is usually referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensen-converting enzyme 2 is metalloenzyme, which is found on the face of endtheial and other cells.
ACE2 protocol contains N-ster-fleptidase M2 codes and C-complectrin renal amino acid transferer.
ACE2 is a protein of a single type of membrane I, with its specific enzymes exposed to the front of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The externalized protein of ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane in the enzyme known as herdase, and the resulting decomposition is extracted from the blood and eventually out of the urine.
ACE2 is present in many cells: ACE2 is associated with the cell primarily with the cell cell II cells of the same type of alveolar, entrocytes in the smaller intestines, and enderial cells, and the smooth nerve cells in many cells.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in crebral cortex, stritum, hypothalamus, and brains.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE secretary.
ACE distinguishes antimalin I from antimalin into a vassocring annotation II.
ACE2 distinguishes carboxyl-axyl-ennono-phenine from angiotgen II (Isp-Arg-Val-Tyl-Tyr-In-HE) and divides it into a varoidatsis (1-7), (H-Isp-Ap-Val-Tyl-Tyle-H).
ACE2 can also distinguish a number of props that include a [des-Argd9]-bradykinin, apelin, neuroterin, Xnophins A, and grelin.
The ACE2 also manages the movement of the internual amino acid transferer SLCA19 and is included in Hartnup's disease.
Like Transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entrance to certain coronavirus cells, which include HCOV-NL63; SARS-CV (SARS virus); and SARS-CV-2 (CV virus causing COV-19).
Pointedly, the combination of Spike S1 SV-COV and SARS-CV2 protein in the enzyme of ACE2 on the face of the cells results in endocytosis and the movement of both bacteria and enzymes to endosomes between cells.
This entry procedure also requires making Sprotein enabled by the protein TMPRS2, a barrier under current screening as a treatment for disease. This has led some to conclude that reducing the symptoms in ACE2, in cells, can help fight infection.
However, many leading and active organizations have encouraged continuing with a common ACE ban and treating with ARB.
"Restruction and analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "" using ACE restraints was associated with 34% greater reduction in pneumonia risk compared with controls."
"More than that," the problem of pneumonia has been reduced to patients with ACE vaccines who were at greater risk for pneumonia, especially those of stroke and heart disease."
"The use of ACE prevention has also been associated with the reduction of patients dying from pneumonia, although the effects were not so serious than the damage caused by pneumonia."
A composite human agent ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a new treatment for severe lung damage, and it seems to promote pulmonary hedynamics oxygen escape from the ppopopolysasasicridide-induced arcs of stress syndrome.
Half of the hyACE2 for people takes 10 hours to work and begins working after 30 minutes more than your current working time (a period) of 24 hours.
One study indicates that rhACE2 can be a suitable drug for those who are unable to drink traditional reintenance system initbilitors (RAS initbilists) or in diseases where angiotens II is active. The prevalence of rICE2 has been diagnosed in a medical research for treating a respiratory disorder syndrome.
"B 'COVID-19' software software programs are designed to help you find numbers in connection with the 2019-20 Cronavirus epidemic, as a means of contacting people (" who are affected") that they may have had contact with an infected person.
A number of programs have been developed or evaluated, with government legislation in some places.
There have been the development of the amplifiers.
Secret concerns have been expressed, especially regarding systems based on the track of the application of the amps.
Other methods that do not need confidential information include the use of the alphabet in Bluetooth to replace the user’s position with other young ones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and the Apple announced that they would build a way to support such applications in Bluetooth directly to the Os in Andreid and OS.
In China, the Chinese government, in cooperation with the Alipay, has developed an ap which allows citizens to examine whether they have had contact with COVID-19 people.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, tap is used as TraceTogther.
"This application was developed by local IT workers, launched as an open resource and will be given to the government. In North Macedonia it was released "Stop Korona!"", "App works with Bluetooth to pursue access to people who may have the virus and to be given immediate response to health authorities."
This application was developed by the Department of Communications and Technology and the Department of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the apply was expected to be approved by the Google Plain Store and the Appp Draw.
"On 12 April, the government said that the app for human identification was in a advanced stage of development, and it was to be available for release in a few weeks. A similar apply to Ireland, and France ("Stop Covid").
Both Australia and New Zealand consider Singapore's Trace Toghere application and BlueTrace platforms. Russia is intended to establish an anti-explication application when a person passes the limited boundaries of COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they are absent from their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at Cambridge University, lists several factors that could be a problem with app industry, which includes misleading warnings and chances of not getting a warning if the ap’s energy is limited to only a small number of people.
"To resolve problems related to the ap "e-connavirus" that is misleading or dangerous, the Apple sets limits on the types of organizations which can install Coronavirus apps in its Apphior, which said it will be only those of "custom" or trusted organizations."
Google and Amazon have established similar boundaries.
Secretists express their concern about the problems of tourism using the coronavirus scans, especially in the case of the development of a system designed to deal with the connavirus epidemic will be stopped after the threat has passed.
The Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement that limits this type of search.
The agencies have set up nine policies in government institutions:
"Declaration should be "make, necessary and appropriate"" "
the development of the period of awareness and observation should have the conditions of eclipses;
The use of the data should be limited to the goals of COVID-19;
the preservation of the data and the knowledge of words will need to be protected and shown as a defense based on evidence;
a biopsy should avoid lowering the risk of prejudice and reducing the value of things;
or whatever sharing of business matters with other people will be required by law;
There should be caution against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
"Accumulating in a useful way is all of the "repair"" will be required, including local health experts and small groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohne Gzen) also produce survey lists."
The recommended Google/Applet program aims to correct the sequence problem by removing the Os shortcuts work in case it is no longer necessary.
Some countries that have used navigation based on the industry are more than the aps, which eliminate both the need to navigate the ap and avoid sequence.
In Israel, a network-based sequence was authorized.
Personal solutions that are based on a network that can reach the depths of the unsupervised area can have serious privacy problems.
However, not all the plants have large screens that need to get to the depths of a person’s place; the number of privates that have been built using large screens for connections (see below) alone.
In South Korea, a non-app-based cast was used for a person's tracking.
Instead of using a markedap, the plant collects the information for navigation on various sources which includes a data listing of a young package and a card purchase card, and combines this to send text messages to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this knowledge to warn people who might be infected, the government has also provided local information available to the public, which is approved for many changes in privacy following the rise of the MERS.
This knowledge is available to the public through aapp and a database. The countries involving Germany consider using both large and private physicss.
Since April 6, 2020, details have not been published.
A coded approach is a well designed method, with many research publications dating back to at least 2013. Since 7 April 2020, more than 12 teams of experts have sought solutions to privacy, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect the user with other young people.
However, the PIP-PT is an attempt to connect with both major and complex ways, and it is not a single protocol. Various protocol systems include Decentralyd Privacy-Prenessog Proxicity Trafficing (PPPPPT/DPPP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Evertte Numbers, CEN), Prostitive Protocols and Mechanisms for More Contocations for More Contacing (PAD) and others.
In these protrusions, the human body’s visible body never leaves the finish line, and all the connections are in disarray.
The Privacy Group in MIT Media Lab has been establishing the Safe Paths, platform for use privacy precautions when collecting and using a space or meta as a guide line to follow the progress of COVID-19.
"It is based on a search from the white paper "Adds Gone Rogue: Mainating Personal Privacy in an Epidemiic" published in March 2020. One similar attempt is the Hopetrace platform of the Enigma MPC, a company that established secret technology first in the MIT Media Lab."
The Safetrace uses secure technology to allow users to share the serious environmental and health of the area and other users and the law, without putting the matter in jeopardy.
On April 5, 2020, the international TCN Coalition was formed by groups associated with what had been the very different means, with the aim of reducing division, and the international use of the aps for navigation and warnings, an important factor in public acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that he had issued an invitation to the Blue Torace government government commission used by its officialap.
On 10 April 2020, Google and the Apple, the companies that control the small platforms of Andreid and OS, announced how to track people, and asserted that it will protect privacy, based on the Blueoth Low Energy and the cryptography technology.
They also print the technology used in the museum.
In accordance with the Apple and Google, the structure is intended to be removed in three categories:
to enable governments to create a legal application of coronavirus to protect privacy
Installing this feature directly into the OS and Andreid Google and Apple order to correct the problems of starting and continuing awareness by first sending the system with OS backs, and then removing it in the same way after the threat has passed.
The b'Drug repositioning (also known as the re-use of a tree, re-profing, re-tasking, or perpeulic reflectedching) is to reuse a prescribed medication to treat another disease or health condition different from that created for it.
This is the type of scientific research currently being done to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment methods.
Other methods of research include the establishment of COVID-19 and the transfusions of the system of plasma. SARS-CV-2 have about 66 proteins capable of using a tree, each with a number of crystals.
A review of those sites consists of a logical program to establish a drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important options of SARS-CV-2 is proteasse such as pope, RNA polymerase based on RNA, shelicasse, Sprotein, and ADP rophophastaase.
Hussiein A, and others have investigated a number of drugs that can be used and developed and analyzed its structure with the same high - standardized drugs in order to speed up the development of the strong SARS-CV-2 drug in this pre-medical field of treatment that may be used as a research treatment.
chloroquine is a drug for malaria that is also used for certain antibodies.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four trees that are studied as part of the combined medical research.
New York district official Andrew Cuomo announced that the research of the New York District of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
The treatment has not yet been approved by the FDA medical research process and is authorized under the EU as a research therapy that will be used for emergency conditions for hospital patients who are not able to accept treatment in medical research.
"CDC" means "to use, volume, or a period of hydroxychloroquine to prophylaxis or treatment for SARS-COV-2" is not correct."
"Doctors said they used a drug when there's no other way."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts little research on the use of chloroquine combined with magic, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
A great study is under way at Duke University and University of Oxford.
The NYU Langone Medical School conducts safety research and hydroxychloroquine to prevent disease.
"China's medical research in Wuhan and Shenzhen says that favipavir "" really works."
The 35 patients in Shenzhen have been diagnosed with a respirator during 4 days, while the height of illness was 11 days for 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 cases with pneumonia, half was given favipavir by another half given mimifinovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the evidence in support of the tree is limited and prework.
On April 2, Germany announced that he would buy a drug in Japan and put it on the market, and then he used soldiers to send the medication to university hospitals, where a drug will be used for treating COVID-19 patients.
In accordance with the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Aba has introduced himself to the Trump conference on the treatment of medicine. The drug may not be completely effective in the worst cases of illness where the virus has been repeated.
It would be unsafe to use it in pregnant women or when they attempt to become pregnant.
"One study oflopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antimicrobials and trinavir, concluded that "" no benefit has been found."
These trees were designed to prevent HIV from repeated contact with proteasse.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to alter drugs to acquire a liquid that will be associated with SARS-CV-2 prognosis. There are critics in the scientific community by directing efforts to reuse products specially designed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO includes alopinavir/ritonavir in a Global Joint Research.
The Remdesivir was built and developed by the Gilead Sciences as a treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg diseases. The Gilead Sciences found that Remdesir had a work to combat infection from thevitro against the viruses of Filo-, pneummo-, paramyxo-, and corona-.
One problem with antibacterial treatment is developing mutation therapy that can lead to a serious, infectious disease.
A previous study suggests that remdesir may have a high gene - control factor. There are a number of continuing medical studies, which include two that are conducted at Cleveland University Hospitals; one for those with moderate disease and one of the most serious cases.
There are three continuing medical research for the vitamin C in which patients are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two explosives (Chinese, Canada) and one unsupervised (Italy).
The New York District launched an azromycin research on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Center of Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) arranges for Teiwin's Alvesco medical research (Cicelsonide), a smokeed corticosteroid in the Asthsteroid, in treating patients who have no symptoms of a new colonvirus virus.
A study of angiotensin-convering enzyme 2 Section II continues with 200 patients who will be admitted from the worst conditions, declared in a hospital in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to see the effectiveness of this treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are now studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung problems in patients who are suffering from less symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, includes 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who have minor symptoms of not needing hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or who are breast - feeding or who have no effective means of preventing pregnancy are not qualified.
Several anticoalants are studied in Italy.
The low - density heparin is widely used for treating patients, also led to the Italian Medicine Agency to print guidelines for its use.
A study of a number of 300 patients who studied the use of enophaparin sodium in preventive and treatment techniques was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-COV-2 is a virus, scientists have concentrated much on reuse of antibacterial drugs developed by earlier diseases such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribabilin:ribin was proposed for the COVID-19 in accordance with the 7 Chinese instruction programmes
Umifinovir:umifernovir was proposed to treat COVID-19 in accordance with the 7 Chinese instruction programmes
Some antibiotics that have been found as alternative to treating COVID-19:
Tocicizumab (Anti-IL-6 subsequenttor): Enforced in China.
In the study also in Italy and China. See Tocicijumab#COVID-19.
The objective of the b'A COVID-19 is an estimated goal against Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no end to medical research, there are many ongoing efforts to develop such a goal.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was not expected that the objective of SARS-CV-2, the cause virus, could be found under 18 months.
Five vaccines were held in the Department of Security Research in April.
The COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
The great wave of outbreaks worldwide in 2020 led to a massive financial and research project for the development of a goal.
Many organizations use genes to establish the non-SARS-CV-2 goals.
Since April, the key elements of CEPI’s project are fast, being cut down, produced, and reached on earth.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technical platforms had been investigated and developed in early 2020 to form a practical goal against COVID-19.
The activities of large platforms that developed in class safety I include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Orderna founder I and the goal resolution: Moderna, MRNA 11273)
Vilar véctor (Character I and the goal range: Can Sino Biologiecs, adenovirus type 5 octurs)
As the CEPI scientists reported in April, 15 cents are in the first stages of the project, and 78 are confirmed as infected programs (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 are announced, but very little public knowledge is available (perhaps planned or developed).
A survey of IEI class checks the safety prior to the use and fighting of the virus, usually not planned, is controlled by explosives, and is in many places, while the more accurate, effective doses are checked.
The study of Part III usually involves more volunteers, including a control team, and the operation of a diagnosis to prevent the disease, while serious consequences are taken with proper doses.
"Of the 79-purpose journalists established (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 had not been checked by the public (who had done research" before treatment").
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced whether it was to be used for the use of a molecular program that would convert the proteins into a treatment system.

On March 12, 2020, the Health Ministry of India announced that it works for 11 persons separated from society, and even how fast it can take at least a year and a half to two years to establish a goal.
On 12 March 2020, the Medicago, a biotechnology company of Quebec City, reported that similar coronavirus was built under little support from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The objective can be studied by a library, and a review of people is scheduled for July or August 2020.
"At the beginning of that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump gave the Cure Vac's "a large sum of money' to get the aim of Covid-19", and the German government resisted it."
On the 17th of March 2020, the American drug company Pphizer announced working with the German Biottech company to build the MRNA goal together.
MRNA's MNT162 goal, currently tested before treatment and medical research is expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on the 17th of March 2020, the Takis Biotech, a biological company, announced that they would receive the results of a premedical examination in April 2020 and its final goal could begin to be studied with people in the autumn.
In France on March 19 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparationions (CEPI) announced growing $4.9 million dollars in a comprehensive study involving the Institute Pasteur, Themis Bioscienture (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, which sets the total amount of CEPI cost in the program for COVID - 19 million.
Some of CEPI’s colleagues in establishing the COVID-19 goal is Moderna, Currezac, Invio, Novacax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing animals for six different purposes.
Researchers of the Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they set the RNA goal of testing you, COVID-19.
This goal was developed within 14 days, and a goal was reached in China.
By the end of March, the Canadian government announced C $2275 million for research projects on COVID-19 methods, which include several goals for Canadian companies and universities, such as services in Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
"At about the same time, the Canadian government announced C $192 million in particular to establish the goal of COVID-19, with development programs for "the "song of the goals" of the national" goals which are to be used when another connavirus arises."
"On the 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on a survey of Pittco Vac, the potential goal of COVID-19 on rats, and "" the MNA's goals for SARS-CV-2 S1 which are to produce the effects of the major components of infection [in the mice] seen in 2 weeks after finding the goal."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a goal based on DNA, which may be an air spray.
Using antibiotics, DNA will be made to produce within a human virus to produce harmless molecules such as bacteria, which may encourage antibodies to produce antibodies against the SARS-CV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, firms, and universities of US combine operations to obtain IBM computers, combined with air computers from the Hewlett Packard Interprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some goals involve the effects of other living things, which are also called unpredictable.
That means they can have far more serious side effects of the disease they prevent.
One informal study in Australia wants to register 4,170 health workers.
Goals may not be safe or effective.
The first study of the function of the goal is used in COVID-19 animal models, such as a ram with an ACE2 installed, other laboratory animals, and human - like animals, showing the need for a third attempt to protect against the virus, and to interact with other countries to ensure safe processes that work around the environment.
The goals of the SARS and MERS have been studied in animal models.
Since 2020, no anti-SARS strategy has proved to be safe and effective.
According to the research pages published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of new goals and medicines for treating SARS was a major concern for governments and public health services worldwide. And there is no established goal for MERS.
As the MERS surged, it was believed that current SARS research can provide a useful clinic in establishing goals and treatment methods for the MERS-CV virus.
Since March 2020, there has been one goal (DNA) of MERS that completed a class of public medical research, and the other three are still being studied, and all are the goals of active-vectors, adenoviral-vectors (ChADOx1-MERS, BVRS-Gac), two MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Communication departments promote the idea that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and that the goal is already available.
The accounts quoted in various chat rooms refer to the already existing genetic codes as well as the goals of other Coronavirus relatives such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious virus caused by sere acute respiration system system system 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Symptoms of a general illness include fever, coughing, and cough.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throats, odors, and abdominal pain.
The time from the onset of symptoms is usually five days but from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in symptoms of disease, others result in an increased pneumonia - prone disease and death of many organs.
Since 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in the countries and areas 2,210, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 5686,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people in contact, usually by tiny points that come out when you cough, sneeze, or speak.
Although the droplets break down during the breathing process, they often fall to the ground or onto objects rather than into bacteria in longer distances.
People may also be infected with a virus and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive in organisms for about 72 hours.
It is most common during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it may develop before symptoms and later stages of the virus. A common form of testing is the respiration polymerase chan (rT-PCR) by the laboratory.
The use of masks is encouraged by those who suspect that they have the virus and their caregivers.
The public’s suggestions for the use of a mask vary, some authorities say that it is not used, others say that it is not used, and others require that it be used.
At present, there is no specific goal or treatment against COVID-19.
The transmission of the virus has been found in many countries in all six areas of WHO.
Those infected may have no symptoms or symptoms such as fever, colds, fatigue, and asthma.
Signs of an emergency disorder include difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty in awakening, and facial expressions; and early treatment if these symptoms appear.
Strange as it may seem, symptoms related to breathing above may appear as a cough, a cold, or a sore throat.
Signs of disease in the mouth flowing to the thighs such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed in a variety of percent.
Some incidents in China first produced only chest density and heart rate.
In some, the disease can escalate into pneumonia, kill many organs, and kill.
This is also called the age of the outbreak of symptoms of disease.
The period of symptoms for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
7.5% of people with symptoms develop during 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected symptoms are infected.
The role of these who do not have the symptoms in transmitting it to others is not yet fully understood; however, current evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The number of infected people who do not display symptoms is now unknown and studied, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected patients have had no symptoms during hospitalization.
China’s National Health Commission began to include cases of non-invasive cases in her daily numbers on April 1; of 166 infected on that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms during a test.
Both the cough and the saliva may include a virus.
Verbal expressions tend to produce a number of phrases rather than mere words.
A study in Singapore found that un-sealing can lead to 4.5 yards [4.5 m].
Although the virus is usually not transmitted into the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it can be transmitted by breathing and that air stations in the hallways outside people's rooms have produced unsupervised resalses of RNA virus.
Certain medical procedures, such as tube and cariopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the production of crystals to be airborne and result in breathing.
Although there is concern that the risk is low, this risk is considered to be low: A virus is highly contagious when people have symptoms of disease; although increase may occur before symptoms are detected, the risk is reduced.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet fully clear how easy it is to spread the virus, one person usually infects two or three people. The virus lives for hours to days in things.
In particular, the bacteria were found to live on a single day on a card, about three days in plastic (polypropylene) and iron (AISI 304), and about four hours in 99%.
This, however, varies from temperature to humidity.
So can soap also be useful if used properly; soap products reduce the protective membranes, kill them, and remove them from the skin and elsewhere.
Some soaps, such as basalconium chloride and chlorhedine Gluconate, are not effective. In a Hong Kong study, samples are taken two days after they are first admitted to the hospital.
Of five of the six patients, the first sample showed a high percentage of the virus, and the sixth patient showed a higher infection rate on the second day.
The since end of acuse respiratory system system coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is the since the end of a respiratory system system system coronavirus, first being removed from three people with pneumonia, became involved with many serious respiratory infections in Wuhan.
All aspects of a new SARS-CV-2 virus are from crononics.
While outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, which explodes its protective balloon. SARS-CV-2 is closely related to SARS-COV.
The lungs are very sensitive to COVID-19 because the virus enters the main cells through the enzymes called angiotsin-converning enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most found in the second type of alveor cells in the lungs.
"The bug uses a special glycoprotein called ""-spike" (peplomer) to contact ACE2 and enter the main cell."
The worst heart damage was found for 12% of infected persons admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China, and it is more likely to occur in serious diseases.
The symptoms of high Cardiovascular disease, caused tumors and antibodies during the spread of the disease, but serious heart attacks may also be related to ACE2 rectors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are very visible in the heart and involved in heart function.
The case of thrombosis (31%) and vanous thromboemolism (25%) is found in ICU patients infected with COVID-19 and may be related to weak prognosis. The screening of people killed by COVID-19 has shown diffuse alveololmage (DAD), and lymphocyte in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a hormone for ACE2-expressing respiratory fluid, serious COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hypertensive syndrome.
In particular, the parogenic GM-CSF-reating T-cells are apparently in line with the discovery of IL-6-reating timesocytes and the causes of bad disease in COVID-19 patients.
There have also been reports of lymphocytic infultrates during automation.
WHO has published a number of biological tests.
A common method of testing is the verb process process polymerase (rT-PCR).
A study is usually done in breathing samples obtained from a skin tube; however, an nose sputum tube or sputum sample can also be used.
The results are usually found within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two blood samples taken within two weeks and the results have little application at that time.
Chinese scientists have been able to divide part of the coronavirus and print a sequence of elements so that viruses around the world can develop a polymerase scan (PCR) for the diagnosis of disease.
Since 4 April 2020, a biopsy (which can detect active viruses and if one has already had a virus) has been developed, but it has not been widely used.
Chinese studies indicate that accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States authorized the first medical examination on March 21, 2020 used at the end of that month. Zhongnan Hospital proposed screening methods based on treatment factors and the risk of control of disease control.
Bilatal multural volume-grantities are spread by peripheral, asymmetric and posterior.
Subpletal dialance, crazy paring (depressive shock with avarable alveolalling), and consulation may develop as the disease progresses.
Small data available by microscopic ions and COVID-19thophysiology.
The main reasons found in the study were:
Microscopy: supergars, lung consoles, and pulmonary Odema
Four types of pneumonia virus can be identified:
normal hormone: pulmonary odema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, carge atypical pneumocytes, Interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infultion and multinulunicatered gas.
DAD and D-Bus alloy.
DAD is the cause of actured respiration disorder (ARDS) and respiration hypoxemia.
destroyable enzymes in alveor Caviations and pulmonary interstial fibrosis
Blood: dised invascular solution (DIC); moderythroblastic reaction
Steps to reduce the risk of infection include staying in a home, avoiding crowded areas, frequent washing hands with soap and water for about 20 seconds, getting used to clean the mouth and nose, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC encourages closing the mouth and nose with a tube when coughing or sneezeing and encourages the use of the inside of the earring when the tube is not present.
Proper handwashing after coughing or coughing is encouraged.
The CDC promotes the use of a face mask when in public, in part to reduce infection from people who do not have symptoms. Self - contact techniques are intended to reduce contact with infected people and large groups by closing schools and workplaces, preventing travel and breaking large gatherings.
Distance guidelines also include that people remain at least 6 inches (1.8 m) apart.
"There is no known drug that works in prevention of COVID-19. Since the goal is not expected until 1921 at least, the best way to control COVID-19 to try to reduce the number of those with the virus, called "" to make the line flat."
The CDC also encourages people to wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear dirty, before and after breakfast, coughing and coughing.
It also encourages the use of at least 60 per cent of alcohol-salhots, but only if soap and water are not readily available. In places where hand tires are not easily available, WHO provides two methods for producing them in the area.
In these ways, the function of antimicrobial comes from ethanol or ispropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacteria in alcohol; "It's not a virus in handwash."
Glycerol is inserted to form moisture.
People are treated by care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen treatment, and support of other vital organs involved.
The CDC recommends that those who are suspected of being infected wear a regular face mask.
ECMO has been used to solve the problem of breathing, but its benefits are still considered.
Sanitation, health, and nutrition have been promoted so that you can avoid infection.
Health - support therapies may help those who have symptoms that are not harmful to newly infected diseases. WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have published suggestions to care for patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19.
Innsovists and pulmonologs in the U.S. have combined medical procedures from various sources in a free source, IBCC.
Since April 2020, there has been no available treatment for COVID-19.
When symptoms are identified, some doctors recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibupphen.
Steps must be taken to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to another, especially in medical areas where procedures may be performed that could produce aerosols, such as intation or a limited ventilation.
For doctors who care for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping a person in the Airborne Infernal Inspection Roman (AIR) rather than taking normal measures, preventing contact and breathing infection. The CDC explains the guidelines for the use of personal proactive activity (PLE) during an epidemic.
The requirements: PPPE pencil, opticor or face masks, eye protection, and doctor gloves. When found, refrigerors (in place of facial masks) are encouraged.
N95 respilerors are authorized to be used in factories but FDA allows masks to be used under the Emergency Use Administration (EUA).
It is designed to protect against particles in the air like dust, but the protection of a particular body compound is not guaranteed in its use.
If masks are not available, the CDC suggests to use different types of cheeses or, if there is no other way, make masks.
Most cryptic conditions of COVID-19 are not too bad to require mechanical considerations or other methods, but some need them.
The form of breathing for people with respiratory trouble related to COVID-19 is still being studied for hospital patients, and there is some evidence that invariation can be avoided by high watch and sal cannnula or bi-level conditionation pressure.
Whether these two lead to the same outcome is unknown to people who are seriously ill.
Some doctors prefer to live with invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this method reduces the spread of the respiratory particles compared with the hingfrow and sal cannnula. The worst conditions are common for adults (more than 60 years, particularly over 80).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds, which reduce the number of people caused by a failure to handle the sudden increase in the number of emergency COVID-19 who need hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% were exposed to severe pain, 2.3% needed venient help, and 1.5% died.
In China, about 30 per cent of persons in a hospital with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to ICU.
Ventilation machines become more complex as acute respiration syndrome (ARDS) is built into COVID-19 and breathing becomes more difficult.
Ventilators with high pressure control methods and PEEP are required to increase oxygen supply while the risk of vetilator - related lung damage is reduced.
PEP may not be available in old ventilators.
Medical research began in January 2020, and several antimicrobial drugs were studied in medical research.
Rremsir seems to be the most effective one.
Although 2021 are still developed, several of the tested drugs have already been authorized for further use or already advanced tests.
Antiviral drugs can be tried for people with a serious virus.
WHO encourages volunteers to assist in the research on treatment and safety of drugs that can be used to treat. FDA has temporarily authorized calcium as a treatment for conditions under which man is already seriously ill.
It has not yet been in needed medical research to prove that it is safe and effective in treating disease.
In February 2020, in China a young apple was developed for handling infection.
Users are required to enter a name and ID ID.
This application is able to see 'if you are close to a person' using a navigational metastasis that could be dangerous to infection.
All users can observe the condition of the other three users.
If a situation seems to be dangerous, ap encourages not only isolation from people, but also health authorities. A thorough analysis of many tables through the youth’s tablet, face - to - face alert technology, follow - up phone and development information is used to transport infected people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agents to follow the telephone of people who are thought to have a coronavirus.
This is done to separate them from the community and to protect those who may be contacted by infected citizens.
In March 2020, the Deutsche Telelem shared a plot of land of the German state, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of infection.
Russia developed the art of face awareness in order to find out who broke the rules of social isolation.
"The Italian health officer Giulio Galera said she was told to the young workers that "40% of the people continue moving."
The German government has run a 48-hour computer strike match for 42,000 assistants.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has made a national declaration of resolutions to prevent the increase in the Coronavirus.
People may face the stress of living alone, being restricted, having poor health, or being afraid of being infected by the virus themselves.
"BBC has quoted the "Ry O'Connor" "" continued social isolation, loneliness, health concern, depression and economic breakdown is a storm that affects people's minds and their well- being."
The virus may have minor or minor side effects, including some common respiratory infections like normal colds.
Normal cases have been treated within two weeks, while those infected with a severe or serious virus can take from three to six weeks to recover.
Women who are pregnant may be at greater risk of COVID-19 based on fatigue from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but the level of COVID-19 is lacking. For some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
For those who are most affected, COVID-19 may soon develop to acute respiration disorder (ARDS) that causes damage to the respiratory system, septic shock or damage to most organs.
The problems associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal cream and heart damage, kidney and liver.
Clotting wouldalitis, especially the increase in prothrombin time, is found at 6% of those admitted to the hospital for COVID-19, while kidney damage is seen in 4% of the group.
About 20-30% of the people with COVID-19 show high levels of liver enzymes (transnaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the first symptoms of disease and death is ten days, and five are spent in the hospital.
However, patients transferred to ICU have had about seven days between hospitalization and death.
In the study of early events, the average time from the appearance of the first symptoms of the disease to death was 14 days, a total of 6 to 41 days.
In a study of the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate is 2.8% while the mortality rate is 1.7%.
Hestopathological monitors for analysis of the lungs of the dead indicate diffuse alvergarmanage and cellular fibromyxoids in both lungs.
The change of active cytopathic was seen in the pneumocytes.
The lung image showed acut respiration disorder (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart damage was noted in higher levels of nitrogen or heart condition.
According to the March data from the United States, 9% of those admitted to the hospital were already sick. The discovery of medical and economic factors affecting the community may contribute to the death of people.
Estimates of death due to infection vary because of such differences in the region, but also because of difficulties in methods used.
A few of the mild - tempered conditions can cause the death toll to be greater than expected.
However, the fact that death is the result of previous cases of infection can mean that the mortality rate is now low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to receive symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to receive care for a crisis or death compared with nonsmokers. Concern has been expressed about long - term pre - infection.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found a 20-30% reduction in lung function among other people who are exposed to infection, and the pulmonary scans indicate that it is possible to be injured.
This can also lead to postpartum stress after recovery.
In March 2020, it was not known that the previous virus can help to provide effective and long - term protection to people who are recovering from the virus.
The resistance to the virus seems to be possible, according to some coronavirus, but conditions have been reported in which recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by a subsequent tests of coronavirus.
These conditions are thought to be an epidemic rather than a new infection.
The virus is thought to be a natural and from an animal and then to humans.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the virus was almost fully led from man to man.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 at Lancet, indicated that the first day of outbreak of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official documents of WHO reported that the symptoms of the first disease were established on December 8, 2019.
Several methods are used to name the dead.
The figures vary from region to region and from time to time and depending on the level of research, the level of medical examination, treatment regimen, time from the earliest appearance and traits of people, such as age, sex, and health.
In late 1920, WHO distributed emergency documents at ICD-10, U07.1 killed by a proven SARS-COV-2 virus and U07.2 struck by COVID-19 by physicians and respiratures against the proven SARS-COV-2 virus. The mortality rate of the virus shows the number of deaths that are affected during the given period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the mortality rate of the world virus is 6.9% (153,822,240,191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies from region to region. Other methods include cares factorityrate (CFR), which show percentage of infected infected ones, and infactuality rate (IFR), which represents a percentage of people with a virus (non-infect and non-infection) dying.
These statistics are not based on time and follow the number of individuals from the infection onward to the remedy.
Although not all infected ones are infected with the virus, the presence of the disease’s elements can provide knowledge of how many people are infected.
In an area where most people are infected in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small area of 4,600, 80 (1.2%) are already dead.
In the Gingel, the virus was aggravated by Carnival conferences, and it entered the youth, causing lower mortality rates, and not all deaths from COVID-19 are officially recognized as infected.
In addition, the German health industry has not yet had huge numbers.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may be infected, as blood donors have studied.
69 (0.004% of the population) were made sure they were killed by COVID-19.
The effect of the epidemic and the mortality rate vary from men and women to women.
Death rates are higher than men in research conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest danger for men is when they are 50, and the gap between men and women is close only in 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The main reasons for the difference are unknown, but genetic and behavior factors may be the cause.
The gender - based range of those infected, the low percentage of smokers in women and men who develop certain diseases such as hypertension when women are younger than women, may contribute to a higher number of men dying.
In Europe, 57% of men are infected by men and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the US government does not follow the sex - related chart of COVID-19.
Studies show that people of both genders, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, may affect people in different ways.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have many opportunities to be exposed to the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the virus will be "COVID-19"."
The director of WHO explained that the CO represents the corona, VI stands for Virus, D represents the disese, and 19 for the year marked by the first outbreak: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen so as not to be named a particular geographic name (as China), animal or group of people, in harmony with the proposals of various countries intended to prevent discrimination. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the sere acute respiency system systemcarvirus 2 (SARS-CV-2).
"WHO also uses "COVID-19" and "COVID-19" virus which causes COVID-19" in public chats."
"Both disease and infection are usually called "" coronavirus."
"During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were often called "" coronavirus" and "Wuhan's "connavirus"."
In January 2020, WHO suggested that 2019-nCov and 2019-Ccompote respiration disease as terms to be used for infection and disease in accordance with the 2015 guidelines against the use of land in the names of disease and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 are issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of the lack of supplies in the production industry, some manufacturers have printed medical facilities such as clubs and veltilators.
For example, when the Italian hospital urgently needed an veltilator valve, and the mechanic could not send it at the time required, the local company used its machinery and recorded 100 valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, suspected news, false and misleading stories appeared regarding the origin, development, prevention, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to pass the virus on to other animals.
Research has failed to find evidence of the spread of pigs, ducks, and poultry by the virus.
There is no known cure or effective treatment for the disease.
International research on the goals and drug combinations of COVID-19 are conducted by government agencies, schools and industrial research groups.
"In March, the World Health Organization began "" to study the results of four anti-substantial treatments which are available with great hopes of working."
There is no vaccine now available, but various substances work to establish vaccines.
The past SARS-CV function is in use because SARS-COV and SARS-CV-2 both use ACE2 rector to enter human cells.
Three methods of prevention are studied.
First, researchers plan to develop a vaccine.
The objective of the use of a virus such as this, not working or dead, is to establish a body response against a new COVID-19 new virus.
The second method, the sununit vancines, aims to establish a goal that allows the immune system to respond to certain aspects of the virus.
If it is SARS-CV-2, such research focuses on S-Spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme rector.
The third option is nucleic acid goals (DNA or RNA goals, a new method for setting a goal).
The goals studied in any of these methods will be to be considered safe and effective. On March 16, 2020, the first medical study of this goal began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The goal contains an uncomplained genetic code that is attached to the disease - causing virus. Development based on the properties of the disease has been proposed as a challenge to the establishment of SARS-COV-2 goal, but this is not guaranteed.
There are more than 300 medical research since April 2020.
Seven studies have already been investigating the already authorized treatment of malaria, which involves a four - part study of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reuse drugs form much of the research in China, and nine remdessivin study of remsir III in several countries will send a report toward the end of April.
A powerful rebuttal of the medical initiative of COVID-19 and non-use drugs for treatment had begun, in April 2020. Several anti-invating drugs are studied in the treatment of COVID-19, including remidesivor, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine,lopinvir/rinavir/rinavir and gatehar are associated with interferinor.
There was physical evidence of remsirism, in March 2020.
Progress in the treatment of patients is seen in the adequate use of remsiosvir.
A medical study of Type III is conducted in US, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, formerly used in treating malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, and results were not yet approved.
However, research results are intended to be studied.
The health authorities of Korea and China encourage chloroquine to be used.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while encouraging the daily amount of one gram, notes that the amount is twice as high and can be deadly.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued permission to be used in emergency situations of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine according to physicians who treated people with COVID-19. The 7 Chinese programs included interferron, ribabilin or miferenvir in the treatment of COVID-19.
An unauthorised data indicates that high ribabin metres are required to prevent SARS-CV-2 from invitro.
Nanzamaxinide has been proposed to a continuous video research after showing the inactive ban on SARS-CV-2. Research indicates that the first rise of protein priming with the transmembrane protein protein 2 (TMPRSS2) is particularly significant in the entry of SARS-CV-2 by related to ACE2.
A chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine along with azithromycin or without it have large boundaries that prevent the medical community from receiving this treatment without continuing research. Oseltavir does not prevent SARS-COV-2 from thevitro and has an unknown role in treating COVID-19.
The Cytokine stomm may be a problem in later classes of COVID-19 very bad.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine can have anti-cytochine satellite features. Tocicicijumab has been added to medical guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a brief investigation.
A study of subsection 2 which is not scheduled in the national team in Italy was conducted after showing the adverse effects on people with a serious disease.
Associated with a blood test of serum feritin to locate cytokines storisms, it is intended to prevent the occurrence of this, which is thought to be the cause of death for certain affected persons.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was authorized by FDA on the basis of previous research in treating steroid rephery cytone syndrome caused by different factors, CAR T therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no unregulated, controlled evidence that toyzumab is effective treatment for CFS.
The transmission of the cleansed and powerful components of the immune system of those who are recovered from COVID-19 is considered to be a way that does not require less prevention.
This method was tried for SARS and the results are not known.
Aviral therapy is the expected method used when low - dose treatment can create protection against SARS-COV-2.
However, other methods, such as cellular cytotoxicity based on the properties of disease and/or phagocytosis, are possible.
Other methods of treating the elements of disease, for example, are developed.
The production of calcium serum, which contains a blood component from recovered patients and which are associated with the virus, can be removed for immediate use.
Coronavirus, group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan’s Central Hospital, who later became infected and died from COVID-19 after helping to concentrate on the spread of infection.
