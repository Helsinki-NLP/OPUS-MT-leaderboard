The case of the rapid increase of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Arena and the United Kingdom, January 1 to 15 March 2020
A growing trend of coronavirus (COVID-19) shows similar percentages in countries of the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom that, although in different parts of the country, the outbreak of COVID-19 continues rapidly throughout the country.
Based on experience in Italy, the countries, hospitals, and clinics in crisis should increase the willingness to accept the majority of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical care, and especially emergency care.
In 31 December 2019, a group of people with an unknown genetic condition were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Protection, China.
In January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the rate responsible for new coronavirus is now known as terrare respatation syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, SARS-Cov 2 has been named coronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence thus far indicates that 80 percent of COVID-19 cases are chronic, that is, bipolar disorder that is associated with or is not associated with pneumonia, and most of these people are improved.
In 14%, COVID-19 is developing into a serious condition requiring hospitalization while 6% of the remaining cases face a serious condition requiring emergency care.
Death of patients lying for COVID 19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine the increasing reports of the event of CoVID-19 in each European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them to those in Hubei Protection, China.
It also compares the current number of persons with CoVID-19 in the EU/EA and that of the UK with that of Italy during January 22,15 March 2020.
The circumstances of COVID 19 countries in EU/EA and UK
After China, the COVID-19 spread widely in areas and the change of the COVID 19 epidemic worldwide is now followed by what is happening in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the director of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is a epidemic.
The 5 March of the Eurourveillance 2020, Steereri et al. reported the first confirmed COVID-19 of Europe in accordance with WHO definition.
In EU/EA, the first convinced persons reported by France in 24 January 2020 to the people who returned from Wuhan, Hubei Protection, China.
By March 15, 2020, COVID-19 people had been found throughout the 30 countries of EU/EA and the United Kingdom (UK), that between 311 December 2019 and that day, 399,768 who had the virus and 1.727 dead people, now 17,750 infected with the virus and 1,4441 dead were only Italian.
Finding a growing and growing number of cases of COVID-19
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), statistics for persons with CoVID-19 in every country worldwide, obtained only by legal resources such as the National Health Department, national and regional health authorities as well as WHO, are returned every day by 8:00 a.m.
This date was used in surveying COVID-19 of EU/EA and UK, and compared with those in Italy.
As a silent representative of the ongoing COVID-19 cases, count the increased increase of 14 days of COVID 19, thus considering the natural continuance of the COVID-19, in each of the EU/EEA and UK, during the period of January 2215 March 2020.
It also introduces an increasing number of reported state conditions for each country at 15 March 2020 8:0 a.m. compared with Italy during the 31 January 22,15 March 2020.
COVID 19 WESTERN-19 lands in the EU/EA and UK
The increasing shift of the 14 days of COVID-19 conditions in the EU/EA and UK countries generally follow those of Hubei Provence (China) (Image 1).
Throughout EU/EA and UK, the increase in the event of COVID-19 began to rise about 21 February and greatly enjoyed on 28 February 2020 (the study aid).
This is greatly increased by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other countries in EU/EA and UK show the same high percentages of COVID-19 development (Reservation).
Image 2 shows an increasing number of conditions of CoVID-19, in countries of EU/EA and UK compared with that of Italy at the time of January 22,15 March 2020.
It is noteworthy that, on 15 March 8:0 a.m., some 15 countries of EU/EA and the UK had already listed the total equal number of Italian in 3 weeks ahead or less.
Our results show that the number of reported cases of CoVID-19 is rapidly increasing at EU/EEA and UK.
The percentages mentioned in the increased event of COVID-19 indicated that the epidemic is continuing at the same pace in all countries.
This happens despite the fact that nations are in different regions, variations in the public health response of the community, and probably different definitions of conditions in the countries and the various proteins that should be checked for patients to ensure COVID-19, which includes a follow - up examination.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected states of Italy described the situation when 10% of COVID - 19 patients needed emergency care and the media reported that hospitals and emergency units in these regions had reached their peak.
Data entry of COVID 19 in the hospital and/or emergency care unit is found in the EU/EEA section in 6% and 1%, in order (date not shown).
It should, however, be collected in an orderly manner to correspond to the current alert alert alert that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2018–11 showed great differences as to the availability of emergency beds and central European care, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in the population of 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that the countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 emergency care beds and between 100,000 people in human society).
In imitation of conditions associated with the overall overall increase of health care, which provides the average level of each EU/EEA and UK for increase in conditions that have been reported in the hospital due to COVID-19 associated risks, 90% of breaking the volume of emergency care beds, is given in the third review of the emergency CDC for COVID-19.
Since conditions are prevalent in certain regions in the EU/EA and UK, and hospitals and emergency care units are often helpful to individuals in the region, information about situations and emergency care beds should be obtained at the level of the Nonmetrial elements for dates 2 (UNTS-2).
The Italian experience and current foreign wages indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly increasing in EU/EEA and UK.
The countries, hospitals, and units of emergency care should provide a continuous link between SARS-Cov-2 and an increase in patients with COVID-19 who require medical care, and especially emergency care, such as what happened in affected territories in Italy.
As shown in a recent study of the ECDC for an emergency, a quick, urgent, and thorough approach is important to delay the circulation of SARS-COV-2, by making the change from the direction of control to a slow - down course, since the rapid increase in the number of conditions may not yet be due to the participants of decisions and hospitals sufficient time of understanding, to accept and adjust their response to the proper course if it is not used.
An emergency examination also means public health measures to control the ill effects of the epidemic.
There is little space for the nations to be able to take full control of their efforts to reduce the flow of SARS-Cov-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
Failure of this, it is possible that medical services in some EU/EA countries will be faced with a host of patients who require emergency care in the days ahead or in the weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by erre respatary syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), has currently claimed more than 3,000 lives and has affected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world.
Like its similar virus, SARS-Cov, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-Cov-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 has more serious and fatal mortality rates than SARS, but it is more passed and more people than younger than younger men and more males than women.
As a way to respond to a rapidly growing number of published material regarding a developing disease, this article tries to provide a timely and informative return visit on a subject of rapid research.
We will discuss the basic factors about epidemiology, etology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, cause, and prevention of disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this review helps us to understand and eradicate the deadly disease.
The January 25,20 Spring Festival has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who are encouraged to stay in their homes on vacation and on several weeks after the outbreak of a new virus.
The virus is much like the coronavirus (Cov) that caused the withdrawal of the ture respatary syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was called CoV Dase 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and about 50 others around the world.
On March 2, 2020, the virus led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with over 40,000 patients who were discharged from the hospital and over 3,000 patients who died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the foremost enemy of society and may be more powerful than terrorism.
According to Pub Med (https:/www.ncbi.lm.nov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 pages are printed regarding its biology, epidemology, etology, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7,20, which determined the chain of the virus isolated from many patients.
This quote tries to close up the advance research project on a new and progressive subject.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS with another disease caused by CoV, Middle East respatory syndrome (IMRS, 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and the causes of disease as well as other important questions.
CoVs generally considered to be less deadly to humans, mainly causing 15% of the common 4 flus.
In this century, however, we have twice met the Coshogenics, namely, SARS-Cov and MOS-Cov, which caused a plague that began in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to other countries that resulted in serious sickness and death.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third outbreak of CoV in written human history.
As indicated in Death. Death.1.1, bnimonies with unknown roots began to be reported at Wuhan on December 31, 2019 in China’s National Health Commission.
Seven days later a chain of CoV was released.
On January 15, 2020 the first stage of death was reported at Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly in neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, reports were reported for health workers, suggesting that human reconciliation was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was seized and all public transport equipment was set up.
On January 24 a first medical study of disease reported that, of 41 patients with established conditions, only 21 had direct contact with Wuhan sea food market that was considered to be the first place of disease from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO announced the outbreak of global health crisis.
By the time of this report, disease has spread throughout China as well as in some 50 countries around the world (Una.2.2.).
As the situation changes rapidly, the end result and the severity of the plague is not known.
On February 11, 2020, a survey of 8,866 patients which included 4,0221 cases of COVID-19 indicated a much more widely proposed picture of the epidemic next (https:/m).q.com/s/Ulbi-HHHHXXXTHatdA.
SARS-Cov-2 has infected people throughout the years, but primarily for 30-65 years.
Nearly one third (47.7%) of sick people were over 50 years old, fewer than 20, and only 14 cases were less than 10.
SARS-Cov-2 has infected more males than 0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The COVID-19 grew mainly of Hubei and near again.
The COVID-19 took an average of 5 days (2-9) from the beginning to the test.
The average dating period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from beginning to death is 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic duplicate number (I-R0) was 3.7 (95%): 3.51-4.05, and R0 changed to 2.23-4.82.
The number of persons involved rose immediately before 23 Jan.20, similar to the time of major transport before the Spring Festival in China.
The deaths of confirmed patients were 1,444% (1.4%) (95 CI: 1.101.86%), and the changed number of deaths for all patients was 3.006% (95%): 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (men), age (1.660), and serious pneumonia.
The CoVs are part of a family of large hidden bacteria containing one string of RNAs.
They can be divided into four parts, that is, the alpha, beta, gamma, anddela, which is that of the Alpha and the battery are not known to join the people.
Spike (S) of glycoprotein code adheres to the adoption of anantots-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and a floppy pepitive 4 (DPP4) of SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, after which, comes in line, and then the combination of the membrane.
The RNA gene is released from cytoplasm; after a re-servation of the gene, the RNA of the gene associated with glycoproteins and nucleocopid proteins creates molecules that contain vion, which include plasma membranes to release the virus.
The sequence of early SARS-Cov-2 genes was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-Cov-2 found that it is a new form of beta-coV containing 99.98% of the following 10 samples gathered in the first place, the Huanan Seafoot Market in Wuhan.
SARS-Cov-2 is often more like SARS-Cov than MEARS-Cov.
Using the microsopy of electron transmission, SARS-Cov-2 molecules were found in the most clear parts of the epithelitium of air pressure to humans.
The ACE2 people were found to be the SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov.
However, S SAS-Cov-2 is associated with ACE2 more rapid than that of SARS-Cov, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-Cov-2 causes less sensitive contact to patients than SARS-CV.
SARS-Cov-2 can also create a new short protein produced by aorf3b and a extracted protein produced by an orf8.
The SARS-Cov-2 may play a role in the bacterial manipulator and may hide the appearance of IFN ; however, orf8 does not contain any valid background or module known.
On February 18, 2020, the Zhou, et al., reported the ACE2-EM building of the people full of 2.9 Å connected with the Amino acid vehicle.
It was found that this link, which consisted of open and closed buildings, was combined as an admiral and connected to ACE2-BAT1 and able to combine two S proteins, which give evidence of CV vision and input.
The B0AT1 may be a set of treatment in logging to suppress SARS-Cov-2.
Its roots and central vibrations
It is known that both the SARS-Cov and the MERS-Cov were started on bats and passed on to the people by civet cats and lawyers, respectively.
In comparison with SARS-Cov-2 and other CoVs, bats are recognized as the root of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is equal to 96% and two SARS similar to SARS from the bugs called SL-COVVXX45 and the SL-CVVVX2221.
However, which an admiral helped the virus to cross the border between creatures so that it could join the unknown people, and the channel of transmission is still to be clarified.
Ji, e et al., suggested that snakes may be the carriers of the virus from bats to humans that involved a combination of the same characteristics within S protein.
According to research, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggest that thuglin - with a long nose, thugs that are commonly used as traditional Chinese medicines - may be the central plant of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% of the genes found in Covs and SARS-CV2.
However, the 1% difference that has been spread between two genes makes a big difference; therefore, the confirmed results of strong sperm are still intact (Flood.33).
SARS-Cov-2 objects on a large scale are not known at present.
SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov can live without an creature up to 48 hours in a dry area and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%.
SARS-Cov-2 may have the same features.
SARS-Cov-2 is reported to be incompatible with ultraviolet radiation and with temperatures of 56 °C 30 minutes; ether, 75% of ethaneol, chlorine, chracetic acid, chloroform, and other substances, but not chloxid, can make the virus effective.
All people generally lack the immune system against SARS-Cov-2 and therefore are in danger of contracting the new virus.
At present, no detailed research is reported on the reactions of the immune system to SARS-Cov-2.
Therefore, we can refer only to previous studies of some CoV, especially SARS-Cov and MEARS-Cov (Unifa.4.4.4).
Usually, after the virus attacks the body, it is first identified with the normal body's target signals (PRR) that include the erythropators of the type C, the target equal to the Toll (TLR), the non-NLR), and the receptor of IG (IRRR).
By different routes, the virus causes an inflammatory display, the formation of endocrinical cells, and the production of interferrons of I (IFFNs) that delay the spread of the virus and speed up the microphage pagicosis of the antibiotics.
However, the N protein of SARS-Cov may help the virus to escape the reaction of the immune system.
Soon, responsive physical reactions to the immune system join the battle against the virus.
T lymphocytes that include CD4+ cells and CD8+ play an important role in protection.
T cells of CD4+ encourage B cells to produce body defenses related to the virus, as well as CD8+ T cells directly kill cells that are infected with the virus.
The helper T cells produce proinflammary cytokines to help protect the immune cells.
However, CoV can prevent the operation of T cells by producing apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral disorders as well as treatments like C3a and C5a as well as immune systems are also vital to the fight against infection.
For example, the immune system derived from the right patient makes MERS-Cov useless.
On the other hand, overuse of the immune system creates a large number of medical centers in a place that can cause serious damage to the bones and other body parts, and, in the worst case, the failure of many body parts and even death.
SARS-Cov 2, which has the first feature as a group, we have many opportunities to get ill with older people who suffer from coorbitis and pregnant women.
It is not uncommon for people who are exposed to a large number of microbes or to those who have a immune system to attack, to have a higher chance of infection than others.
The average cause of SARS-Cov 2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days based on a survey of the first 425 persons in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1.099 people shows that the period of irrigation had been 3 days on average and had a total of 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, showed that the period of irrigation was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on the knowledge of 8,866 people.
It is particularly important for the health authorities to change the time of waiting based on the right wait, in which the immune system is restricted to infected persons but who have no symptoms to pass the virus on to others.
As is common practice, people who are exposed, or infected, need to stay in prison for 14 days.
Should the curfew be extended to 24 days?
Diabetes is usually a major and early symptoms of COVID-19, which may not be accompanied by symptoms or other symptoms such as coughing, loss of air, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, pain, nausea, chest pain, chest pains, asthma, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyssine and/or hypoxemia in one week after the onset of the disease.
In critical situations, patients rapidly improved with severe respiratory infections, saptic shock, metabolic acid, and copoopiothy.
Patients with fever as well as/or symptoms of breathing and severe fevers, even if there are no unusual symptoms seen in the lung picture, should be cleaned up by the virus for a diagnosis made at the outset.
A study of human data performed at the end of December of 2019 indicated that 98% of fevers, 76% of nonsmokers, 55% of dyspinea, and 3% of diarrhea; 8% needed to breathe with electronic aid.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of the family unit as well as in a group of people who had no symptoms.
In comparison, a study of human knowledge in 2012 showed that MERS-Cov patients also had fevers (98%), nonsmokers (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed to breathe with the aid of a machine, much more than patients with COVID-19 and that is in accordance with the highest level of MERS killings than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) as well as painful throats (21%) were also noted for MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was shown that fever (99% 100%), nonsmoking cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and painful throats (13-25%) were major symptoms and electrical breathing was needed about 14% of patients.
On February 14, the death due to COVID-19 was 2% when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 persons worldwide.
In comparison, SARS deaths caused by SARs in November 2002 for 10% of all cases were confirmed by 8,096.
By Merchans, based on a study of human knowledge in June 2012, death was 37 percent of the cases of 2,494 cases.
The first survey reported that the SARS-Cov-2 was high at 6.47 with a level of confidence (CI) for 5.7-7.23, when the RRS-Cov had a height of from 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-Cov-2 with the MERS-Cov and SARA-Cov concerning their symptoms, death, and RRH was signed as Table 1.1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-Cov-2 has the highest capacity for movement than MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov, but it has less lethal power than both.
Therefore, it is more difficult to control the SARS-Cov-2 than MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov.
The onset of the categories often takes place in the same family or at a similar gathering or on a transportation basis.
Patients usually have a history of visiting or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with people who are affected or patients in two recent weeks.
It has been reported, however, that people can carry the virus without symptoms longer than two weeks and that abandoned patients who have been discharged from the hospital may also be able to carry the virus again, which provides a warning to increase the time to stop.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the first stages.
For example, the lymphocytes containing the number of white blood cells, < 4×109/L, as well as the high levels of the aminospherespheric and viremia found in 1,099 cases of COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes in liver and muscle and meyoglobin were high in the blood of other patients, and C-reacitive protein and erythrocytes of explanation were high in the blood of many patients.
For patients with serious illness, D-dumemer's level, the product of fibrin in the blood, was high, and the amount of lymphocyte was significantly reduced.
A rare finding was found in the chest of many patients with COVID-19 and which contains two-pounders or a gill shock factor in the shoulders.
Patients are often afflicted with unusual pneumonia, serious lung damage, and acute respiestation disorder syndrome (ARDS).
When an ARDS occurs, uncontrolled diarrhea, fluid growth, and progressive fibrosis threaten gas exchange.
Incompetence of I and pneumocyte type reduces the risk of surfacant and increases the pressure of the upper area, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to improve and increase the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the worst effects of radiation are often similar to the most critical case of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first patological analysis of COVID-19 showed a lapse of pneumonics, the formation of the Hyaline gland, and the access of interstitial lymphocyte cells, as well as multined syncytactic cells in patients, which are connected with ORS's pathology as well as with ARDS.
The RNA of SARS-CV-2 is used by the government-transcriptase polymerase echo (RT-PCR) as the main subject of COVID-19.
However, in view of the high number of pneumatics, which may be faster than the epidemic, the appearance of treatment began to be used when treatment was performed (which was not limited to RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation arose when examination of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of disease, medical displays, laboratory tests, and side effects are important and crucial for effective tests.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhanng group defined a high-level exercise program based on CHERLOCK for the SARS-Cov-2, which gets non-RARS-CV-2 in 2020 x 10-18 to 200 × 10-18 × 10-18 mol/L (10-10-10-Mol/L) for each system of loading) using a container of oil in less than an hour.
It is hoped that a new approach will greatly enhance empathy and benefits if it is confirmed in medical examples.
Because of a lack of experience with new CoV, doctors are primarily able to provide support for COVID-19 patients, while trying various forms of treatment that have been used or developed previously in order to treat other patients such as SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov and other infections (Tebulba2.2).
This treatment includes current therapy and possible treatment for antiviral drugs, memunoppressant, steroids, plasma from right patients, Chinese medicine, and mental aid.
It is even made to use plasma for right patients as a treatment.
Pparmaceutical firms compete to build defenses and antiviral goals.
SARS-Cov-2 particularly attacks lungs at the start and is likely to attack, to a small degree, other body organs showing ACE2, such as a gallometric and kidney mast.
Nevertheless, poor nutrition and a lack of breathing are a major threat to patients and is a major cause of death.
Thus, breathing support is essential to improve symptoms and to save health and include general health care, higher flow of air, air installations without physical equipment, and air exposures used to damage the body to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be based on the use of external membrane exxygenation (ECMO), an improved method of cardiopulmonary surgery used to treat heart failure or life - threatening breathing failure.
In addition, keeping up - to - the - counter management of electrolyte, prevention and treatment of secondary organs, as well as safety of the body’s main organs, is also important to SARS-Cov-2.
It is known that the cytokine storm is the result of excessive reaction to SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokine storm is the response of the cytokine program with the release of the cytokines, including TNTF [TNT], IL1, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-6, FNN]..., FNN, FNN..., and MCP1.
These cytokines encourage the immune system to release a large number of free medical systems that are the main cause of ARCS and many body parts.
The stress of the immune system is vital to the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for sensitive patients.
Corticosteroids and tocizumab, an anti-IL6 ochonic, have been used to treat cytokin storms.
Another treatment for the stress of the cytokine storm includes the control of the immune response directed to T cells; the blocking of IFN-KO, IL-1, and TNNF; the departure of JARK; blinatumab; the target for the use of a cytokinine dictionary; and HDAC.
Ostoids, such as mununoppressants, are widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the risk of diarrhea.
However, ssteroids at high levels have not benefited from serious lung damage in SARS and COVID-19.
Rather, it may cause serious side effects, especially aviscular osteonecrosis, which in a remarkable way disturbs prognosis.
Nevertheless, a short list of corticosteroids in low levels to the middle has been recommended to be used carefully to patients of COVID-19 who are seriously ill.
At the time of writing, no effective treatment against infection had already been established.
However, a remdesiver, a nucleotide anallog, was found working on an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesvir is a new antibiotic that was first developed by Gilead to treat Ebola and Marlburg bacteria.
Later, the remdesiver also indicated that it could prevent the RNA virus with a single strand that connects the MIRS virus to the SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead has provided a Chinese designer to carry out research on SARS-Cov-2, and the results are considered red.
In addition, the baritinb, interferon-%02, epibinar/ritovir, and libarin have been promoted as possible treatment for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious reactions may occur after a combination of epirinar/ritovir treatment.
The treatment dealing with other medications used by patients should be carefully observed.
Plasma from right patients and body protection building
The collecting of blood from patients who are exposed to contagious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting disease rather than long history.
In fact, healthy patients often have a high level of immune systems that fight the disease in their blood.
The immune system is the immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocyte to fight diseases and other unnecessary substances and to see different cells from the disease and prevent them from operating directly.
Based on this, Plasma was collected into the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was absorbed by 10 patients in a critical way.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by reduced swellings and vibrations of the virus as well as increased oxygen levels in the blood.
However, confirmation and clarification are needed in order to establish a general application of the treatment before making any medical advances.
In addition, in view of the results of treatment, some of the advantages associated with plasma should be given careful consideration.
For example, the immune system may greatly promote immune response and cause cytokine, which may be a life - threatening risk.
The amount of antibodies in the blood are often low, and the need for Plasma is great that patients can be treated in a critical manner.
It is difficult to build and produce certain immune systems very quickly to combat a global epidemic.
As a result, it is very important and reasonable to distinguish B cells of normal patients and to be marked by genetic codes that have active genes or to be eliminated by the immune system that works to represent vital proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of immune systems.
TCM has been used to treat various kinds of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the combination of most parts in various forms to the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM vision.
Most working parts remain unknown or even obscure as they are hard to pick and confirm such parts or their efficient combinations.
In the meantime, because of a lack of effective and correct treatment for CoVID-19, TCM has turned into one of the major treatments of patients with small symptoms to middle - aged patients.
For example, the Shu Fung Jie Du pills and the Lian Hua Qing Wen tablets were found to apply to COVID-19 treatment.
The highest rates of treatment for patients with COVID-19 were noted in many Chinese states that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Nincia (50%), and Hunagen (50%), while the state of Hubei, which used TCM to be about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had a low degree of recovery (13%).
This is an incorrect comparison, however, since other factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in a diagnosis.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study of the West - drug therapy (WM) alone and a combination of WM and TCM treatment.
They found that the times needed for body temperature to improve, end symptoms, and hospital stays were shorter in the WM+TCM group than only the WM group.
Ironically, the rate of poor symptoms (from small to risk) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than the WM (7.4% compared with 46.2%) and death was much lower than the WM class of WM (8.8% compared with 39%).
Nevertheless, the operation and safety of the TCM still waits for well - controlled research on large levels and facilities.
It may also be interesting that the course of action has been marked and made clear that practical aspects of TCM treatment or its combinations are available if possible.
Patients who have complaints or are convinced that they suffer from COVID-19 are often more likely to fear a highly contagious and deadly disease, and the people who are in prison are resuscitated, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, coughing, and the serious side effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and stress in the mind.
In the first phase of SARS, a number of psychiatric disorders that include chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, cerebral palsy, bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder, mental disorder, and even suicide were reported.
A strict routine of communicating, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 revolution, may cause many people to become worried and feel guilty about the consequences of intercondition, arrests, and loss of family and friends.
As a result, mental care should be given to patients of COVID-19, people who are suspected of having them, people who communicate with them and the normal community they need.
Mental aid should include the development of a number of psychiatric fields, clear and accurate communication about SARS-Cov 2 and medical programs as well as the use of electrical appliances as well as programs to avoid close contact with others.
Practical goals are vital to breaking the bond between animals and people who are affected to associates that may be exposed and are often in line with antiviral treatment in the control of new infectious diseases.
Efforts have been made to make goals based on S for long-term and powerful body defenses as well as/or the protection of SARS-Cov.
Limited goals have been examined in animals regarding SARS.
However, the work of living things has been a goal for adults as well as a death - dealing model and their protection from infection from animals to humans before medical research can begin.
This is because SARS introduced 17 years ago and no new disease has been reported since then.
On the other hand, rare circumstances and groups of MERS continue to come from the Middle East and spread to other regions because of the persistence of biological sources from animals to humans in infected areas.
Merchants have been designed for Merers by using a non-infected virus, DNA spamids, microbiologists, nanothetics, bacteria such as the virus and subdivisions that combine them and others have been tested in animal models.
The building of a safe and effective aim against SARS-Cov-2 in the affected people is an urgent and vital task in controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to withstand the difficulties due to the longer period (an average of 18 months) needed to build a goal and changing types of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 recently began to show its full program of treatment for thousands of patients.
In many cases, patients are able to recover a little, without the effects of a previous illness.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also linked to a high rate of illness and death in patients with serious illness.
Therefore, building a disease - causing model is essential for health insurances to put first, especially in areas with little help.
Based on studies reported up to now, the following factors may be affected or linked to the cause of COVILD-19 patients (Tebula):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS cause, which is also true by COVID-19.
The COVID-19 appeared primarily at 30-65 age and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 in a survey of 8,866 patients as described above.
Patients in need of emergency care had a higher chance of dealing with other diseases and difficulties and were considerably older than those who did not have (66 compared with 56), suggesting that age is a factor contributing to the effects of COVID-19 cases.
Sex: SARS-Cov 2 has more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Already present and complex diseases: Patients with COVID-19 who need emergency care have a high chance to deal with serious heart damage as well as artythmia.
Heart - to - heart events again became a major reason for the death of SARS patients.
It is reported that SARS-Cov-2 can also adhere to the ACE2-portive lóocyte, which may lead to the risk of liver failure on patients with COVID-19.
It is good to note that age and the illness already exist are closely related and can be confusing.
The rare effects of the laboratory: C-reacitive protein level (CRP) in the blood indicates the risk of diarrhea or muscle damage and has been raised that it is a potential cause of illness, response to treatment, and complete recovery.
There is also a link between the CRP level and the cause of COVID-19.
In addition, the higher lactate dehydronase (LDH), apartate aminosphere (AT), alanine aminosphere (LT), and creatine urease (CK) may also be able to predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely shown in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during muscle injury.
As a result, they are common symptoms of heart failure or lack of confidence.
Major treatment symptoms: chest radiation and temporary continuity of symptoms of treatment should be considered along with other predictable effects and complications of COVID 19.
Ostoid usage: As mentioned above, immunosuppress proteins are often used as an alternative treatment to reduce the risk of diarrhea.
As the high number of corticosteroids has been widely used for terminal SARS patients, the majority of the survivors were affected by aviscular osonecrosis with a life defect and a poor quality of life.
As a result, if necessary, steroids should be used at a lower level and for a short time for COVID-19 patients.
Mental depression: As described above, during the outbreak of COVID-19 many patients suffered severe depression as they had to endure periods of excessive restraint and uncertainty and see the deaths of close family members and of their patients.
It is vital that mental admonition and long - term support be given to help these patients recover from depression and return to normal health.
In accordance with the studies of human knowledge up to this time, COVID-19 appears to have different aspects of epidemiological features from SARS.
In addition to a frequency in the lower respiratory system, SARS-Cov-2 is able to slow back to the upper respiratory system and cause small symptoms or not to cause them to be caught in the first stage of infection, as are the Coves that cause normal colds.
Therefore, patients involved in the first stage or period of treatment may produce a large number of bacteria during daily activities, resulting in much difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, the exposure of SARS-Cov was thought to occur when patients were very ill, while much infection did not occur in the first stage.
As a result, COVID-19 outbreaks are more serious and difficult to control than SARS.
There are a number of further efforts in China that include the ban on Wuhan and the surrounding cities and the continued blocking of the entire population with the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-Cov-2.
Although these steps have greatly damaged the economy and other parts of the world, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a decrease in the incidence of the epidemic.
The most promising measure is that outbreaks will end in March and the decrease rate will continue for 3-4 months.
Some scholars, however, are skeptical.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be more joined than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-Cov-2 may carry two thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-Cov-2 were found in both mid-turbinate tubes and patients ’ voices that recovered and left the hospital within two weeks, indicating that the newly discovered virus may have been a second half-spire.
However, promising symptoms occur in China based on a drop in the number of young people who are sick, indicating that the current strategy may be working.
At first it was predicted that Ebola would affect one million people and that half a million people would die.
However, because of strong restraints and isolation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is possible, like SARS-Cov, that SARS-Cov-2 may be weak and eventually eliminated or become a more chronic virus capable of treating people.
The comparison of the COVID-19 cases with that of SARS and MERS is given below (Unifa.5).
SARS-Cov-2 is closely connected with coughing or sneezes, and it may be possible with direct contact with germs.
The virus was also refound in the liver, giving rise to a new chance of transmission from the neck to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 patients reported that 411% of patients may have been admitted to hospitals, including 17 patients who had previously been infected with other diseases and 40 health caregivers.
Hence, great care should be exercised to protect individuals, especially health - care professionals, the well - being of family members, relatives, even people standing next to patients or affected by them.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear eye actually; both the use of a surgical simulator and the N95 respiators (in series # 1860s) help control the spread of germs.
The eye masks block fluids from a person who may have been involved in breathing and holding to the face of matters, where they can be passed on to other people.
However, N95 sisters alone (in series # 1860s) can protect you from breathing small violions at 10 to 80 mm, while only 5% of them are fully able to pass; SARS-Cov-2 has the same size as SARS-CV both about 85 mm.
Since molecules are able to pass through five surgical procedures combined, medical surgeons who work directly with patients must wear N95 dots (in series # 1860s) and not surgery masks.
In addition to the masks, health - care surgeons should wear well - suited defenders to reduce contact with germs.
Bacteria can enter a person’s eye.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor was infected with SARS-Cov-2 though he was dressed with N95 nminki; the virus may have entered his body by jumping into his eyes.
As a result, health - care providers should also wear face - to - face protections that are unable to show or look for while working with patients.
In a community in areas that are affected or may be affected, it is highly recommended that everyone wash his hands with soap that is more frequent than usual, trying to stay in the house to block and communicate quickly with people who may be involved.
A three - distance distance is considered to be the right distance between people and patients.
These measures are practical ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of infection.
Although SARS-Cov-2 arrived as a new virus in the world of mankind, its presence with the SARS-Cov as reported on 7 January 2020 was to be a warning in China because it remembered the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, until January 2020, the director of the Center of Disease Control in Wuhan reassured the citizens that the new virus has little infection and is less developed from one person to another and that it is no problem to prevent and control the disease.
This message caused the public to ignore, especially when the whole country was preparing for Spring Festival, and they missed the critical time to control the virus while still in Wuhan.
Chinese disease controlers may learn from this crucial lesson and make significant progress in the future.
For example, these refrigerators should (1) be more specific when they make public declarations as each word is important to citizens and can change their moods and decisions; (2) they feel more and respond to unfamiliar information from the clinic than they expect official reports from doctors or officials; (3) they are more likely to control what may be a disease in the first century than they try to comfort the public; and (4) they make more and more time to improve public awareness of the illness and other public reactions.
The COVID-19 outbreak has been developed by the new SARS-Cov-2 by the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China as well as some 50 other countries worldwide by the time this was written.
Since the virus is much like SARS-Cov and the symptoms are the same between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreaks created the feeling that SARS are repeated.
However, there is a significant difference between CoVID-19 and SARS, which is vital to control the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects more people than younger than younger men and more men than women, and the risks and mortality rate are higher than the young.
SARS has a mortality rate higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared with 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients pass it when they are very sick, causing an even greater problem in control of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-Cov-2 has increased faster and farther than SARS-Cov.
A regular RNA analysis of SARS-Cov-2 may be effective in some COVID-19 cases.
On the other hand, patients who have been abandoned may also be more prone to a diagnosis of a virus.
These findings greatly increase the risk of infection.
Since there is a rapid advance in the study of CoVID 19, there are a few of the serious problems that need to be solved, including:
From where does SARS-Cov-2 come?
Although it was found that there are 96% similarities between SARS-Cov-2 and two CV bats like SARS, we cannot conclude that SARS-Cov-2 are coming from the trees.
Which animal was in the middle of the path that transmitted the virus from the original wild, let alone the bats, to the people?
If we do not know the answers of#1 and 2, we are not able to escape successfully transmission, and outbreaks can be worse at any time.
Although cell models and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-Cov-2 adhere to ACE2, how does the virus actually get into respiratory cells and cause changes that result from sickness?
Is the virus again attached to the ACE2 cells in other body organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot attain a swift and accurate diagnosis and treatment.
How long will the plague continue?
How do the genes of the virus change during intersecting among humans?
Will it be a global epidemic, ending like SARS, or will it be worse from time to time than the flu?
It may take some time, but it may take time to reflect on the answers to the above questions and many other questions.
Regardless of the cost, however, we have no choice but to prevent the epidemic as soon as possible and to restore our health to normal conditions.
The roots of the virus from animals to humans of coronavirus
Changes and flexibility have encouraged the coronavirus cocovirus (CoVs) and its channel, which includes people, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two Coves (HCVs) were known to cause minor illness, such as common cold.
The explosion of the vire autate respatory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respatory syndrome (IMRS) changed the situation to indicate how much damage HCV can cause to life.
The appearance of SARS-Cov-2 in central China at the end of 2019 also put Coves in the theater and surprised us with a higher flexibility but with a lower percentage compared with her SARS-Cov.
HcoV is zoossis and understanding the origin of HCV’s ozone layer can help us.
Most HCVs appear on bats and do not cause disease to them.
The public charitys of some HCVs are also known.
Animal decorations have a direct effect on the prevention of human diseases.
Research on the interaction of the CoV channel on animals may reveal important insights about the development of CV in humans.
In this review, he introduces a description of the already existing knowledge about seven HcoVs, and it will focus on the history of its discovery and its origin of the ozone layer and the combination of various organisms.
More important, it compares and distinguishes different HCVs from the theory of evolution and genetic engineering.
The current C thereforeV epidemic of 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful recovery and the consequences of the viral changes in the severity of disease are also appreciated.
The Coronavirus (CoVs) are part of the Coronavidae family, which is made up of a group of closed bacteria, with a high sense of voziness, which has a single chain of RNAs.
These bacteria contain the largest of the 20 - to 32 kilobastos of the RNA virus called "Cov" because of their crownlike encephpe under the electron microscope.
According to the structure, CoVs with non-genomes have no parts to do the same.
Approximately three thirds of the consistently have two hundred free-read frames (ORF1a and ORFB), translated to be standard platform polyprotein forpp1a and pp1b.
The polyproteins are further twisted to build 16 more proteins without building, called unsp1 ~16.
The remaining part of the geometry contains ORS for building proteins, which include Spike (S), steam (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
The number of beneficial proteins related to this list also has a code of various Covic lists.
Based on the difference in the sequence of proteins, CoVs are listed according to four categories (alpha-Cov, beta-Cov, gamma V anddela-Cov), where the battery-Cov field contains many HCVs and divided into four rows (A, B, C and D).
A hypogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rats are the source of Alpha-Cov genes and the beta - Cov, while birds are the source of the gamma Covs anddela-Covs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have steadily passed the limits of nature and most of them have turned to the pothogens vital to humans.
To date, seven Covs (HoVs) are known.
Among them HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are alpha-CV.
Other five Beta-Covs include HCov-OCom3, HCV-HVV(HVVA1, vire resperate respatery syndrome syndrome coronvirus (SARS-Cov), Middle East despatororrolam (MERS-CoV) and SARS-Cov-2.
HcoV-229E, HCV-OCOR3, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 are often causing small symptoms, such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov, and recently discovered SARS-Cov-2 are causing a serious illness, resulting in a serious respiratory disorder in many patients resulting in a higher probability of the formation of splatorial distrome (ARDS) and other respiratory diseases without lungs.
The first type of HCV-229E, B814, was separated from the noses of common cold patients in the mid - 1960 ’ s.
Since then, additional information has been gained through the extensive research of HCV-229E and HCov-OC4, both of which cause the signs that accompany them.
In fact, it was adopted that HCV treatment was generally harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is one of the most tragic of modern history, it infected more than 8,000 people and had approximately 10% mortality rate.
Ten years later, the Middle East respatory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks resulted in an ongoing plague in the Arabian Peninsula with occasional outbreaks in other parts of the world.
The new HCov (2019-nCov), later named SARS-Cov2, is the leading cause of the 20th plague of coronavirus (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 on March 3,20.
Anam has been crying and the earth should be ready for the coming SARS-Cov-2.
All seven HcoVs have the origin of zootics from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
A lot of evidence supports the origin of all HCVs from bats, where bacteria are perfectly compatible with the situation and do not cause disease but show a variety of genes.
The COVID-19 has presented major medical, scientific, social, and social challenges in China and on earth.
Following the roots of the HCV ecliptics provides a framework for understanding the natural history, motivational power, and vibration factors.
This can also guide or help to determine the cause, the middle and development of the SARS-Cov-2, which will have important effects on future transmission.
In this definition it reveals a trace of the origin of the ozone layer, a combination of different organisms and HCV pathogeniss.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the same unit that the HCV virus of the parent often causes not sickness in their natural environment but causes sickness after it involves different creatures and new species.
It also restores the percentage of HCV conversions when the increase in inter-supervication often reaches and decreases.
The consequences of ongoing SARS-Cov-2 are discussed again in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the initial division of HCV-229E type B814 from the noses of patients who had contracted the common cold, different CoVs were separated from the most affected animals, including garlic, glove, cattle, pigs, cats, cats, and dogs.
Over the last decades, seven HCVs have been found.
A brief summary of the history of the HCV in sequence (Tebulage 1) may benefit and teach.
The first type of HCV-229E was separated from the respiratory system of patients with respiratory conditions above the year 1966, and was adopted to develop in the stages of XI 38 lung cells.
HCV-229E patients had symptoms of normal cold, including painful headaches, dizziness, and pain, and fever and coughs were seen in 1020 percent.
Later, in 1967, HCov-OC4 divided the muscle organ and the next series of movements in the digestive brain.
HcoV-OC43 treatment factors appear to be similar to those caused by HcoV-229E, which could not be classified according to symptoms of other respiratory infections such as bacterial A and hinovviruses.
Both HcoV-229E and HCV-OC43 have spread around the globe, and it is often associated during the winter season in good weather.
Usually, the timing of these two bacteria is less than a week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy people with HcoV-229E experienced a mild fever.
Only a few patients with clinical depression showed serious respiratory problems below.
SARS, also known as "a rare pneumonia, has become the first epidemic of HcoV recorded in human history and is the cause of SARS-Cov, the third HCV identified.
The first illness caused by SARS can be traced to the end of 2002 at China’s Guangdodong Protection.
The SARS epidemic led to a report of 8,096 cases of disease and 774 dead, scattered throughout many countries and continents.
Apart from the main subscribers, it was estimated that each case could cause about two other conditions, during the adoption of 4 to 7 days and that the height of the virus appeared on the 10th day of illness.
SARS-Cov patients initially seemed to be suffering from vilgia, headaches, fever, malaria and flu, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory pressure as the latter symptoms.
Demphonia, a faulty liver analysis, and a higher creat urease are among the rare substances of the soap operas due to SARS.
The spread of alvel damage, the explosion of an epithelitical cell, and the increase in macrophages are noted for SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients need emergency care and air installation.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, many parts of the body that involve the immune system, the liver, and the kidneys can also be absorbed into these critical conditions, often accompanied by the cytokine storm, which may be especially lethal to those with antibodies.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung surgery of a relative of the first patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, major efforts have been made in connection with HCV research have been made.
HCV-NL63 was separated from the 7 - month - old child of the Netherlands by late 2004.
It was first discovered that it had increased to young children, to older people, and to patients with antibodies that were placed in place with respiratory infections.
The discovery of coryza, conjincivitis, fever, and bronchitis is common to HCV-NL63.
One independent study described the division of the same virus from the breast of a 8 - month - old boy who suffers from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Though discovered in the Netherlands, it is actually scattered throughout the world.
It has been estimated that HCV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of normal respiratory infections, and its high peak occurred at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HcoV-NL63 is linked to obstractive larygiitis, also known as macroup.
In the same year, HcoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71 - year - old male who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
Apart from the hormones found in public and bronchiolitis, HCV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute athmatic division.
Like HCov-NL63, HcoV-229E and HCV-OCC43, HCov-HU1 was found worldwide, causing small respiratory infections.
All these HCVs found in society are well adapted to people and often have little chance of change to become more pthetogenic diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons as in the rare nature of the HCV-NL63 type that is most fatal, reportedly causing a serious respiratory disorder in China.
Often, when these HCVs acquire easy links and keep them in constant condition within the population, they kill or are less active.
The MERS-Cov was first isolated in 2012 from a 60 - year - old patient's lung with severe pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the cases guaranteed by the bomb are from the Middle East, the conditions introduced are spread to close victims who have been reported in various European and Tunisia countries.
Another second outbreak took place in South Korea in 2015 with 86 cases confirmed.
The symptoms of MORS treatment are similar to that of SARS, marked by a growing number of serious pneumonia.
In contrast with SARS, many MerRS patients suffered severe kidney failure, which is now different from Merers among HCV diseases.
More than 30% of patients have chestroinstanal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Since February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 cases of land mines were reported to have high mortality rates by 34.4%, making MERS-Cov one of the most dangerous microbes in humans.
From mid-December 2019 to its end, many pneumonia cases known as SARS-Cov-2 were found in Wuhan, Hubei Protection, China.
The World Health Organization called the outbreak of respiratory disease caused by SARS-CV-2 as the Public Health Emergency That Should Concern the World and develop a disease called COVID-19.
On March 3, 2020, there were an estimated 90,053 cases of illness worldwide, and 3.4% of deaths.
Significantly, the death toll in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, whereas one outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-Cov-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CV and MEARS-Cov, which have been introduced as fever, coughing and dyssine.
Patients are also infected with diarrhea.
Minimism is one of the most serious symptoms and can develop rapidly into acoustic acidity syndrome.
Although SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov 2 are almost identical because of the same high - level nucleotide sequence of 82%, there are different groups in the branches of the microgenic tree.
SARS-Cov-2 appears to be short but relatively close to SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov.
It is reported that there are people who do not have symptoms with SARS-Cov-2 and may have a side effect of its rapid growth worldwide.
Comparisons and division of SARS-Cov-2 with six other HCovs produce a much more interesting variety.
First of all, the duration and length of HcoV is very similar.
In this regard, SARS-Cov-2 follow the standard percentage of six other HCVs.
Second, the care for the symptoms of COV-19 is between SARS-Cov and four HCovs received in the community (that is HCV-229E, HCov-OCOC43, HCV-HV-HVI1 and HCV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-Cov-2 shows the symptoms often seen during the public exposure to HCVs, which involves a lack of clear symptoms, small symptoms or no symptoms.
On the other hand, the lower set of emergency conditions for COVID-19 can also be seen as in the condition of SARS-Cov, although the average is low.
Third, SARS-Cov-2 has also shown some interesting charts with both the HCov features found in public and the SARS-Cov.
On the other hand, the transmission of SARS-Cov-2 is as high as that of the HCVs found in society.
On the other hand, it will still be confirmed whether the transmission of SARS-Cov-2 is reduced to people as in the condition of SARS-Cov and MEARS-Cov.
Finally, like other HCVs, SARS-Cov-2 can be found in samples in the wild.
Whether oral transmission of SARS-Cov-2 plays an important role when it comes to SARS-Cov under certain conditions is still to be explained by future research.
It is also very interesting to see whether SARS-Cov-2 will show up at certain seasons of the year, as is true of the HCVs found in public.
Nevertheless, the features of SARS-Cov-2 which involve its involvement, tetogenicity and the saving movement after passing through the people will have a bearing on the final outcome of the COVID- 19..
All the HCVs found in the public cause small symptoms to fit well with people.
According to one opinion, it may also be true that people are perfectly compatible with these four HcoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCV plague.
HCVs cause serious diseases in humans and people with chronic HCV are still present.
For this to happen, HCVs have to repeat to the people to a sufficient degree to allow the growth of changes that are in harmony with circumstances that contradict the aspects of the collapse of the system.
In this way, if SARS-Cov 2 outbreaks persist and joins many people, there will be a greater possibility that it will become more cooperative.
If they are highly compatible, contacting people can be difficult to prevent by restricting them or by other means of control of infection.
Over the years, four Movies have been found in the public community, resulting in the general flu in people who have the right response to the immune system.
These bacteria do not need an animal source.
On the contrary, SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov in Papogenics are far from compatible with people and their internal contact cannot be maintained.
They need to keep themselves in a condition and grow up in their nuclear source and seek the opportunity to pass on to the victims who can be identified, probably through a single or more egg and raise the unsupervised.
SARS-Cov-2 have the same features as both SARS-Cov/MEERS-Cov and four HCovs found in society.
It is deeply involved as the HCVs found in society, at least in the first being.
However, Pathgenics are much higher than the HCVs found in society and have a low percentage of pathogen in SARS-Cov or MEARS-CV.
It is still to be seen whether it will bring in complete harmony with humans and spins without the source or the bark of the middle animal.
Before discussing the origin of HCV animals, it will help us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of lovers of change, nature, the source, the middle and the development of HCVs.
The animal becomes a shadow of the HCV change if it holds a closely related ancestor connected with the high hemoglobin level of nucleotide.
The father’s disease is often highly compatible and does not cause disease.
Similarly, the source of a water source supports HCov further and longer.
In both cases, the unsupervised are naturally infected and are natural HCV or its parental virus.
On the contrary, if HCov is retroverted to the central ocean or to the introduction of humans, it is not perfectly compatible with the new wave and often leads to illness.
The central nervous system may be a source of contact and play a role in ingesting the environment that allows the virus to multiply temporarily and is passed over to humans to increase the rate of infection.
HcoV can cope with the final infection if it is not possible to maintain its attachment within the central channel.
On the contrary, HCVs are able to adapt to the middle wave and even develop a long-term metamortic.
In this case, the middle ant becomes a natural spring.
The pidemiological data showed that when viewed back that the SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting animals.
The subsequent studies of reroprevalence showed that game traders had an IgG against high SARS-Cov compared with the number of ordinary people.
Masked palm civet (pale marta) and a racoon dog in the animal market was found to carry bacteria such as SARS-Cov similar to SARS-Cov.
This was wrongly supported by the fact that no more SARS were reported after all the civets were killed.
However, it has been reported that the wild parvets or farms that have never been abandoned on the animal market were active when it comes to SARS-Cov, suggesting that salm civets may be a middle - class site but not a natural source of SARS-Cov.
It is noteworthy, that 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have immune against SARS-Cov, we cannot afford to ignore the possibility that many mammals are the most attractive predators of the SARS-Cov.
All of these seem to be the last SARS-Cov lovers.
A subsequent study of the natural SARS-Cov animal revealed the CoV closely associated with the snake, called SARS-red Rinolophus baV HKI3 (SARSR-Rh-BatCov HV HV), which is found in the Chinese horse race.
These bats are sensitive when it comes to the immune system against SARS-Cov and the sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCV HU3.
This as well as other bats combined in 88-92% of the nucleotide series and SARS-Cov.
These studies have led to the development of a new theory that bats are favoring new pathogens for people.
Coves such as SARS (SL-Cov) are listed on bats, but none except those called WIV1 can be separated as living virus.
Angiotsin conversation in 4 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CV response.
The WIV1 taken from this sample of bats was shown to use a stick, civet and ACE2 people as a reaction to entering the cell.
Interestingly, the tail of SARS patients was able to kill XIV1.
Thus far, XIV1 represents the closely related SARS-Cov ancestor on bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide series.
Although there is a high hormone among these two bacteria, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the nearest SARS-Cov virus and that bats had a nearby SARS-Cov virus.
A hypogenetic analysis includes the MERS-Cov group with the same group as the CoV-HXU4 stick and the CoV-HXULA5.
The CoV-HV-HV of the bats and the MERS-Cov use the same branch response, platformial pepitable 4 (DPP4), in vibration of the virus.
The sequence of the RNA depends on the MERS-Cov-CV is closely related to their non-Covial fellows who have been identified in Europe and Africa.
Thus far, no living MERC-CV is found in wild bats.
The MERS-Cov and its close relatives of the CoV-HPU25 bat is only about 87% of the nucleotide series.
As a result, bats may not be the nearest source of MERS-Cov.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have shown that the hydromedary camels of the seropostitives are directly against the MERS-Cov, similar to the camel from the Middle East in many African countries.
A living MERS-Covlike virus found in humans was isolated from a gas station pipe, which further showed that camels are the real source of MERS-Cov.
It is also noteworthy that small symptoms were often seen but the major removal of the virus from infected camels by MERS-Cov according to research.
Significantly, it is that the infected camels not only transmit bacteria through the respiratory system but also through the mouth muscles, which are also the main channel for transmitting the virus from mosquitoes.
The questions remain, however, since most Merers cases do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, it may be that links from one person to another or to the unknown channels that involve the unknown animals that carry the MERS-Cov.
SARS-Cov-2 shared nucleotide's hormone 996.2% and the CV RaTG13 bats separated from the Rhinolobus anfinis.
As with SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, the sequence between SARS-Cov-2 and RaTG13 is too large to be assigned parental relations.
That means, the bats may have been the nearest source of SARS-Cov-2 unless they were found about the same in the future.
It is estimated that, sARS-Cov 2 must be among wild animals that are sold and killed at Huanan Seafoot Wholelese Market, most of them were related to the outbreak of COVID-19, indicating that there may have been an event of contact from animals to humans.
A few recent studies based on metagenmic sequences have suggested that a group of small mammals known as mongulins (Manis javanica) may be responsible for older ones associated with SARS-Cov-2.
These are new Ndolalin CoV links in 85-92% of the nucleotide series of nucleotides and SARS-Cov-2.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 by about 90% in the nucleotide sequence.
They come together into two list of bacteria that resemble the SARS-Cov-2 in a phylogenic tree, one of them shared with the same background of the same host (RBD) and SARS-Cov-2, the same sequence of amino acid.4%.
In sharp contrast, SARBDs-Cov-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although there is a high level of overall genome for hormone sequence.
An earlier study of sick ngunliins reported the discovery of corntigs from lung samples, which appears to be similar to SARS-Cov-2.
The study used various methods of construction and automation to build a series of genomes formed by about 86.3% of the full length of the genome.
We cannot set aside the possibility that the n'liin is one of the closest animals of SARS-Cov-2.
In the meantime, however, there is no evidence that ngunlin is the direct source of SARS-Cov-2 because of the chain differences between SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov-2 of the anti-smolin related anticoV.
In addition, the distance between SARS-Cov-2 and RaTG13 is much shorter between SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov-2 of the anti-coV-dullets associated with CV.
SARS-Cov-2 for bats, mangolins and other mammals are still to be found.
Although high - sequence biology is found in RBD between SARS-Cov-2 and n'tgalin, SARS-Cov-2 related anti-CV, SARS-Cov-2 and RTG13 have a high array of non-genome biology.
There are high speculations that a high degree of similarities between RBDs-Cov-2 of the anti-Covs associated with Covs and SARS-Cov-2 are conducted by the transition of connections with selection.
Another proposal recommends the reunion between SARS-Cov-2 of the anti-coV-ductures associated with the beta-Cov and RaTG13 in the third wild beast.
As a force behind self - conversion, reuniting has spread among the Covs.
The conclusion is not yet reached regarding the nearby nuclear origin of SARS-Cov-2.
In addition to the most patogenics, the origin of HCV-229E, HCov-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HU1 are also searched.
A hypogenetic evidence has shown that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E may have originated with the subdivided CoV, while HCV-OCOC43 virus and HCV-HCU1 were found in rats.
It is reported that ARCV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CV) from the three - color North American plant showed close contact with HCov-NL63.
On the other hand, HcoV-229E was linked in genes with another catalyph, called Hippoderos/Ghana Kwam/19/2098, discovered in Ghana, while the cammerideds have been accused of being its close association.
To explain, current knowledge about the origin of the known HCV animals is achieved in Part 1 and Table 2.
A hypogenetic analysis has given evidence of the link factors of HCVs in history.
When HCov-OC4 was introduced from another animal to be transmitted to humans from domesticated animals about 1890, the respiratory disease was diagnosed.
The history of the contact of HcoV-229E unique organisms is not so clear.
A related HCV-229E is found.
Among them is the alpha-Coval of the alpha.
A few evidences support the transmission of the virus from bats to people directly.
First of all, people, not the Alpacas, may have contact with bats in the same environment.
Rather, people are closely related to the Alpacas.
Secondly, analpha-coV related to HCV-229E differs and does not cause disease to be caused by bats, while an alpha-coV of the Alpha caused respiratory infections in infected animals.
Finally, the Alpa-coV of the alpha are not yet found in wild animals.
As a result, we will not ignore the possibility that the alpha-Coves receive an alpha-coV related HCV-229E from people.
In fact, bats are a direct source of bacteria that cause human sickness that includes a rabbi virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats may have passed HCov-229E directly to people.
On the other hand, when the alpha - Cov virus is used as a group of HCV-229E genes, the alphacas and hydrogen camels may be the middle layer that transmit the virus to humans, as is the MERS-Cov.
MERS-Cov is a good example of the intersecting of different organisms from bats to hydrogen cameras to humans.
The origin of the MERS-Cov evolution from bats is known for its first search and confirmed by the following findings.
Apparently, the bats provide an opportunity for a variety of bacteria to develop a variety of genes between different animals and the intersecting of different animals.
Long - term health, crowded colonization, intimate social closeness, and a strong flying skill are all ideal conditions for the bats to become a ‘ safe virus belt. ’
On the other hand, MERS-Cov has been installed for several hundred years in the hydromedary cameras.
It is well adjusted to these camels that turn into the center of the chimpanzee and a natural spring.
MERS-Cov causes very little sickness and has a lower rate of change in these animals.
Its involvement in people is a mistake and people remain the last MERS-Cov host since its transmission can be saved.
In contrast with the role of camels in the MERS-Cov transfer, the role of the ngolins, if available, for the transmission of SARS-Cov-2.
In particular, botulin beta-coVs cause more sickness in the ngunolin.
It may be the last version of the Comata-Cov related to SARS-Cov-2, such as civets in the condition of SARS-Cov.
A few possibilities of contact between different species with SARS-Cov-2 from animals to humans should be considered or considered by future research.
First of all, bats may be the source of a virus related to SARS-Cov-2 similar to SARS-Cov-2.
People may play a similar role with bats by doing animal surgery or coal drills.
Secondly, ngunlins may be a middle-spire in which a virus related to SARS-Cov-2 has recently been developed.
People get infected with the virus through surgery and eating threatened meat.
It is possible that many mammals that include domestic animals may be exposed to SARS-Cov-2.
A look is needed for the immune system of domestic animals and wild animals.
Third, as mentioned above, the re-uniting and flexibility of SARS-Cov-2 may occur in the third animal connected with both the bats and the peanuts.
The reflection of the SARS-Cov-2 animals remains.
Apart from the various types of animal predators, there are three major factors on the side of the virus that are vital to making the Coves cross the border of creatures.
First, their high number of changes in RNA frequency.
Compared with other RNAs with one strand, the ratio of the number of CoV changes may be considered "less" to "high" on the average of ~10-4 changes each year for each unit of 2, depending on the level of CoV to new associates.
The CoVs that have an endorbunclese to seek errors, its removal results in an extremely high and less vigorous change in power or ability to develop properly.
Interestingly, the nucleotide has alopegue Remdevir is known to suppress the frequency of CoV by the blocking of this carbon monoxide and the RNA polymerase dependent on the RNA.
The Remdevir is one of the most promising projects against SARS-Cov-2 which will be examined in medical research.
Nevertheless, the number of CV changes is about one million more than those that are useless.
In addition, the number of changes is often high if the CVs are not perfectly compatible.
Compared with SARS-Cov with a high number of changes, the number of changes of SARS-Cov-2 appears to be low, suggesting a high level of flexibility with people.
It is thought, it may already have been in agreement with one of the partners.
In addition to SARS-Cov-2, this also applies to MEARS-Cov, which is perfectly compatible with the hydrogen camel.
It is estimated that genetic mutations can probably cause goals and pathogens against SARS-Cov-2 to act quickly.
Second, the RNA large RNA in CoV uses more flexibility in the change in the configuration and renewal, thus increasing the risk of co-evolution of different organisms, which is beneficial for the development of new CVs when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by many different frames for the open reading and use of protein produced by 37 endome conclusion.
Third, permanent CoVs change captains unordered during RNA repetitions in a different way as "to select copy".
For a mixer who serves as a mixer, a change of type occurs regularly during the CoV RNA circuit.
The RNAs of the homologouss have full height and subgenics that may meet again to form new CVs.
The oxygen evidence for natural recombination has been found in both HCV-HV-HKU1, HCV-OC43, and animal CoVs such as SL-CoV of bats and BAtCV-HU9.
Bacterial connection with the liver on connection with infection
Apart from the three features mentioned above, the connection between the virus and the ant’s host is another major factor affecting the link between different species.
Here, the reunion of SARS-Cov is seen as a common example, which showed evidence of the pressing selection between the stages of the interlocking organisms.
Based on a contrasting analysis between separated people and SARS-Covs in civet, it is thought that SARS-Cov copes with a quick response to the situation of different visitors, especially with changes in SBD for S.
Usually, RBD in the CV S protocol cooperates with the server and is specially chosen for the protection of the ship's immune system.
In SARS-Cov, RBD is 318 Amino acids to 510 in the S1 section, which adheres to the ACE2 person and its coceprators to enter the virus.
The SARS-CV RBD can detect ACE2 responses for various animals, including the bats, the civet, the mouse with the raccoon dog, which allows a virus to combine.
In fact, only 6 of the remains of amino acids that were noted to be different from the division of the human virus and the civet in RBD 4 are found in a motif attached to the channel to deal with the AC2 response.
SARS-Cov on Civet has the change of K479N and S487T in its RBT, which may increase the level of contact for Spike protocol and the person's ACE2 response.
In other words, this change of two amino acids may be vital to the transmission of the virus to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-Cov-2 has the same portion of li and SARS-Cov.
The 30% difference between SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov in the S1 unit of SY is that the level of S and ACE2 people may have changed.
In fact, the study of cryloo-EM shows a high rate of 10- to 20 of this curve than between the ACE2 people and the SARS-CV protein of SARS-CV.
It will also be interesting to decide whether another corecation is required for SARS-Cov-2.
Interestingly, HcoV-NL63 is again attached to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are other HCV responses, such as the Aminopathic N HCV-229E, and 9-O-Acetytyleted sec acid of HCV-OC43.
They may also be viewed as reason to adapt successfully to people after the combination of different creatures from their animal counterparts.
In addition to the cells, the effect of the inter-division of different HCVs is also controlled by dependence on another creature and terminal features.
The difference between these polynomous proteins between people and visitors who are a natural source of HCV as bats, hydrogen camels, and rats may result in a link between different species.
The HCVs should take the factors of confidence in the owner and interfere with the aspects of the vibration in order to create a successful biological link.
In this regard, cell decisions in this important area of contact with the virus are still to be seen and identified.
Intensity of non-genomestion and SARS-CV-2 by using current CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCV Developments: to return to
The variety of broken CVs provides many opportunities for new HCVs.
In this sense, the tiny Coves serve as a collection of HCV genes.
In addition, rapid changes as well as genetic replacements also promote HCV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, the discovery or loss of genes that make up a new protein unit has the power to drastically change the virus’s phenotypes.
Among the proteins that help her in SARS-Cov, OLF8 is thought to be essential for human relations, since insect - related microbes associated with SARS-Cov are separated but found that produce different ORF8 proteins.
A feature of the removal of 29-nucleotides of the SARS-Cov have been found in various forms separated at the beginning of the epidemic.
This removes ORF8 from ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a cooperative change that encourages the conversion of strangers.
Besides, SARS-Cov may have a history of re-inclusion with an alpha and gamma, where a large number of small recombinations were found in the RNA polymerase dependent RNA.
Reunited areas were also found in 159, in large portions of sp10, and in sections of sp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-Cov epidemic has also experienced the events of reuniting between separate lists, which took place in Saudi Arabia’s hydrogen camels.
Besides SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, recombination events have been observed in some HCVs, where HCVs are reunited with other animals in their genes without building.
It should also be noted that the choice of making may contribute to changes that are not intended in the genes of the virus, which may result in the release of germs from the pressure of choice, such as those of the nuclear immune system.
An example of this is the loss of ORF4 full height in the HCV-229E type, due to the removal of both nucleotides.
Although the full ORF4 is seen in the anti-species associated with HCV-229E, the alpha-CV of the alpha indicates the installation of one nucleotide, which leads to the change of the frame.
Finally, but more important, new HCV turns are also driven by pressure to be selected from its friends who are the source.
There were no symptoms or only small symptoms found when the bats were caught in the CoVs, indicating the same harmony between the CoVs and the bats.
It seems that bats are perfectly compatible with the CoV according to the structure and operational methods.
For example, disturbances in the use of a response that stimulates diarrhea on bats are easily reduced by the pathology introduced by the CoVs.
Besides, the work of a natural killer to bats is stressed because of the rise in the response of the admiral response of the natural NTG2/CD94 server and the low level of an display of the complex histocoptactic cells of the I class.
In addition, a high level of creatures that respond to oxygen (ROS) built on the high diet of bats may affect both the repetition of the CoV and the testing of errors with obobobincies, thus giving the pressure to the choice of the design of the most pategenic species when introduced to a new plant.
Too many Pacific types may also be modified and re-divisioned, leading to new proteins or protein components of the combination.
As a result, it is not surprising that three new HCVs appeared two decades ago.
CoVs do not get sick or cause small symptoms to their main companions like bats and camels.
They responded quickly without encouraging a firm reaction by the immune system.
Here are the secrets of why sufferers are not marked and what is behind the critical conditions in people’s illness.
The most serious symptoms are caused by the workings of the immune system and the cytokine storm when there is a strong reaction of the immune system, the damage of the lungs is greatly increased.
In contrast, for those who do not show signs of illness, the immune response has twice been divided into CV rates.
The same approach to dissimilar reactions of the immune system may have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-Cov-2.
The interferon response is particularly difficult for the bats.
As a result, the use of the interferon type I at least for the first classes of SARS-Cov-2 to people should be beneficial.
In addition, the use of NLPR3 inflammary on bats does not work.
According to this opinion, the NLRP3 prevention inflammary with MC950 may be helpful in the treatment of CoVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-Cov-2 is followed by a general unit of SARS-Cov and MEARS-Cov.
Although there has been a 95% of the nucleotide hormone hormone and SARS-Cov, there is also an alkape virus that shared 96% of nucleotide'mology and SARSCV-2.
Although civets and other market animals have been found to contain bacteria such as SARS-Cov, they are not yet found in nearby SARS-Cov-2.
There have been found bebata-Cov in nambalins with the same structure as SARS-Cov-2, indicating that the thugolins may be one of the middle or Covta-Covs may have a share in the genes in the final version of SARS-Cov-2.
Although the questions are still standing, there is no evidence that SARS-Cov 2 is deliberately created by man or by mistake.
The CoV returns to the theater because of the recent outbreaks of SARS-Cov-2.
Coves research on bats and other animals has greatly changed our view of the origin of the ozone and animal sources of the HCV in contact with humans.
The widespread evidence shows that SARS-Cov, MEARS-Cov, and SARS-Cov-2 have a dollic origins and is passed on to people by middle - class associates.
Since exposure to SARS-Cov from human contact with markets in the market, closing live markets and killing civets could have ended the SARS epidemic.
In a similar vein, peanuts have to be removed from the market to prevent the ozone layer, considering the discovery of most of the non-coV levels of the botulin closely linked to SARS-Cov-2.
However, whether it is transmitted and how SARS-Cov-2 is transmitted to humans by thuglin and other mammals are still to be explained in future services.
On the other hand, MERS-Cov has always been present on dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, honey, skin, and fuel for the local people.
It is widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
So it is unlikely that all camels will be killed to control the MIRS, as happened in the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2.
To prevent the multiplication of the MERS, a detailed method should be used to build working goals against camel -Cov, which is accompanied by other steps to control the disease.
Unable to eradicate these bacteria, new genotypes may appear to cause a revolution.
The various types of zootic Covics rotate in the desert.
Significantly, the obobobtains have a wide variety of nuclear strength.
There are many opportunities for these zoototics to change and reunite, resulting in new CoVs capable of inter-ining and/or killing people in the future.
The tradition of feeding wild animals in some parts of China should be left to minimize unnecessary contact with humans and animals.
With the SARS environment, the MIRS and COVID-19, there should be a better preparation and response.
In fact, most bacteria have long existed on earth.
They live in their natural habitat until they have the opportunity to leave.
Although bats have many characteristics that promote the spread of germs, the possibility of humans contact with bats and other wild animals can be reduced if people are taught that they are from them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand CoV physics and its natural counterparts, which will help prevent contact from affecting humans and future outbreaks.
In the final analysis, the best way to prevent the ozone layer is to be isolated from the natural environment of the ozone layer.
SARS-Cov-2 are no longer available.
First, if the bats transmit the shell of SARS-Cov-2 to nongolin, it will be beneficial to see what conditions the bats and the peanuts can share in the same environment.
Second, if bats play a key role in human contact, it should be noted how people communicate with bats.
Third, if the mammals act like a real middle - class animal, how we deal with various creatures involving humans, bats, and peanuts should be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals as well as domestic animals may be exposed to SARS-Cov-2, both watch and research intervention should be made.
If it is an alkalin or other mammals, it is expected that either SARS-Cov2 or its similar parental bacteria will be found in their natural environment in the future.
An ongoing study of this area will explain the course of SARS-Cov2 to animals, with significant consequences for the prevention and control of COVID-19 people.
A review of the case of the case of those who are considered "indicted" and "unfirmed" that they are treated with COVID-19 is required.
By 6 February 2020, our team had published a program of emergency advice for the new Cronavirus therapy of 2019 (nCov), and this cycle provided our experience and a proper introduction to the global epidemic.
However, the 2019 Coronavirus syndrome (COVID-19) is a new disease, our care and understanding is increased by ongoing research and medical experience; hence, tests and treatments continue to continue to be tolerated.
In this book, we answered one comment about our surgeon and presented the subject of a new investigation of those "repredicted" and "confirmed" that they are sick according to Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Cronaravirus of 2019 (2019-nCov) had caused a revolution, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named as the vire respatroromy coronvirus II (SS-CoV-2).
In March 2020, WHO referred to COVID-19 as a epidemic.
To combat the SARS-Cov-2, our team has developed a quick response strategy and is printed on the Internet at the Military Medical Research in 06 February 2020.
It has received much attention since it was printed.
Be aware, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, caution and knowledge of it are increasing on the basis of research and medical experience; that is why, tests and treatment continue to be reversed.
For example, Diagnosis and Treatment Guides for CoVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http:/ww.j.g.v.c.c/), between 16 January 2020 to 3, March 2020, it released seven volumes when other things have been changed significantly.
Our guide received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple resolution based on their experience.
Their work added fresh evidence of our spy and made a significant reference to this global epidemic.
We commend their vital work and express our gratitude.
However, the DO needs to be compensated according to the Diagnosis and Model Guidelines for CEVID-19 (The seventh study program) with recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to ensure the diagnosis of the illness, it is necessary to review any of the aspects of epidemiological history and the two aspects of the display of credit to make extensive analysis, or to meet the three aspects of treatment that have no specific history of epidemical history:
The history of epidemiological: (1) the history of visiting or staying in the city of Wuhan with the surrounding areas, or other communities where COVIAL 19 was reported in the 14 days before the beginning of the symptoms; (2) the history of contact with people affected by SARS-CoV-2 (inucic acid tests); (3) the history of contact with patients who are dying or breathing in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding area, or other communities where there is reported in which the OCVIVIII 19 days before the first 14 days; (4) the history of contact between many patients and several clinics, as well as many clinics and patients, including patients, including patients, including patients who are located in the same places as well as well as large places.
The appearance of treatment: (1) fever and/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) with the properties of COVID-19; (3) the total number of white blood cells that indicate the normal, lower, or lower level of lymphocyte.
A diagnosis of illness should be based on a specific diagnosis of the following evidence of pathogeneic or serological evidence: (1) a rapid evaluation of the PSS-CV-2; (2) a complete chain of the virus that shows high hormone levels in the new covirus virus; (3) a high level of IgM as well as a self - SAR-VV-VV2.
We see that the real timing of the PCR for nucleic acid is in the respiratory system or blood samples in the second ranges (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
The pategenic tests of blood are in the world of the fourth (27 January20) and 5 (8 February 2020); and serological evidence is added in the seventh order.
These changes based on the continued work of researchers to consider the high - speed nucleic cycle acids, along with tests of the respiratory system involving blood test, increased the availability of different organs, and supported the development of the effect of the body’s immune system on a confirmed subject.
Besides, there is more evidence that reminds us that we are careful about patients with unusual symptoms and those with no symptoms.
That is why, the Zhou et al chart should be returned, as it refers to a person who does not have any medical symptoms "like a low risk."
The application of points also requires reassurance in the workplace and in the ongoing medical field.
In conclusion, we hope that more evidence will come and we ask that the disciples be marked.
For a test of the "prediction sickness" and "confirmed illness, we recommend that there be followed and heard new international routes in their home.
Our luggage will again return to our path to render help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths for COVID-19, the highest number of the day
Last night, Bangladesh guaranteed five new deaths for COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of infected days.
Since yesterday, the Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, the Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the reported number of people who are sick is 114 and 33 righteous residents at home.
A total of 17 dead persons have been recorded.
In an Internet news agency, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the victims include four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were over 60, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41-50.
He also said that two of them had come from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is the plague on March 11.
The hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news source, that one of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, which is cared for by the Kuwait Maitre Hospital.
On Saturday, in an Internet video announcement, the minister of the Bangladesh Street Transportation Officer Obaidul Quaarder said that public transport is kept longer than planned, until the next Saturday.
The closing of the public transport system had begun on March 26 and was scheduled to close on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of important goods -- treatment, fuel, and food - is still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were on March 8, for two people who returned from Italy with the wife of one of them.
By March 19, the three are already right.
The number of SARS-Cov2 cases exceed 1 million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of people infected with SARS-Cov2 coronavirus passed one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths were associated with COVID-19, diseases caused by coronavirus.
This happened on the same day when Malawi confirmed her first coronavirus infection and Zambia had her first death related to coronavirus.
North Korea has said, since Thursday, it has been one of the few countries that do not have coronavirus.
Last year, the World Health Organization reported a diagnosis report of 1,051,635 cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty - four hours before a.m., according to the Central European European (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand cases of coronavirus are recorded, associated with about 5,,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting the Johns Hopkins University data, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S on Wednesday for the contact of coronavirus.
Around the world, nations have declared firm measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sovyan, head of the city of Moscow, extended the city wall until May 1.
Throughout the world, President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians will continue to be paid without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament has recommended an increase in the national emergency in 15 days; the vote is interrupted by 2215 votes, 10 votes, and one has an opposing vote.
Saudi Arabia has the time to return from the house of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to continue the whole day; before, it was between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to use time to return home between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had declared its order to stay at home until May 1.
Shops in Australia reduce the cost of purchase for a small housepaper on each purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian store range Woolworths and Colles reduces its costs of the purchase of toilet paper so that one person can buy two and one pack for each shop in the country, according to one.
ALDI also introduces one set of packages, on Monday.
These limits have been transmitted as messages on exit, and on the Percebook pages of the store.
The buyers kept on buying their vast quantities for fear of CoVID-19 if they had to separate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths rerated the purchase of toilet paper from those who were brought home to be one pack for each orders.
These changes follow the fore-and-endment of the four-pounders on each of the Worldworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"Coles, in its March 8, news edition, reported that at the end of the four-loaded decks, "Many stores still lose goods after about the hour of their delivery", and called for "unreal" "unlimited", while ALSI, in its Facebook's second, said ""."
"The sale" has gone up" for the previous week, according to the Wolworths spokesman.
The Cosco store at Canberra also loses the number allowed to be two packs a week ago.
To cope with the shortage, Collese's biggest pieces to the surgeons and also announced the increase in the distribution, Woolworths' ode has been added, while ALDI made a Wednesday's precipices to be found immediately.
Russell Zimmerman, director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that merchants are trying to raise the gun, but the local borderings of the truck distribution time make things difficult.
He expects the cost of production to increase, as surgeons try to meet the need, and a few pencils.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of the early release of the lock, some stores are unable to continue with a Wednesday helicopter.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a sales expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill the stove every night.
The note noted that a small room paper is a weight - weight item, leading to a low number of loops in numbers, and, when it is finished, it leaves a large space open, strengthening the feeling that it is worshiped.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea [that] if there were so many things in the drawers, if the product like the furniture of a small house paper and the tire can be [buried] and there is more, you can probably reduce fear by Russell Zimmerman, according to ABC News.
The duplicating web page produced by the WHO Gives a Cratep said on Wednesday and then lost their lock.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleeke Toilit Tisue, and Sorper who made the Sorbent, emphasized that they worked 24/7 to keep the product there, according to a report from News.com.
The Domain.com, a housing license, reported that some house vendors offer free paper to the first person in the Melbourne Act, when a few arguments are conducted because consumers have time to rest because of the lengthy Labour Day.
The fourth edition of the NNT News, a daily printed newspaper of Darwin, included a nine - page index designed to be cut and used as a toilet.
Stores were at first reluctant to set limits, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3, when they said that they did not have a budget.
Russell Zimmerman added that some products also have a high need, which includes cookies, sweets, dried food, detergents, and flour.
Similarly, except in Australia, on Sunday night the Supermarket sold to the British Internet Ocado was seen running the purchase of the Annes secret paper so that there were two packs of 12 trucks.
The World Health Organization calls COVID 19 of the epidemic
Third, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called the ongoing COVID-19 — a disease caused by the microvirus SARS-Cov-2 — epidemic.
"Just as the word "hick" refers to the extent to which the disease is affected, not how specific examples are dangerous, WHO has shown attention to the need to drive governments into action:"
All countries are still unable to reverse the epidemic process.
If the nations investigate, examine, and analyze, then divide, follow, and respond by controlling the human destiny, says Tedros Adhanmu Ghebesus, the director-over of WHO.
We are deeply concerned about both the frightening and heavy expansion and the alarming lack of movement.
"By Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is the plague "anunification."
"He said, according to CNN comment on February, "Unless the flu, no other respiratory virus has been followed from its appearance until it is spread around the world."
"Ghebreyesus has presented a similar view, "We have never seen the plague removed from the coronavirus."
"He has gone on," and "and he has never before seen a plague out of control at the same time."
A new epidemic situation follows the WHO's January decision to call evolution as a worldwide concern of the public health crisis.
"The director of the United States's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's's, Dr. Anthony Faucci, said, "What remains, it will be worse."
Since Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there have been at least 126,000 examples of CoVID-19 of the world, leading to over 4,600 dead.
The plague of20 coronavirus is an ongoing plague of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the vire respatation of sspatrome coronvirus II (SARS-CoV-2).
The explosions in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was confirmed as the Public Health Emergency Emergency Center in All Nations on 30 January 2020, and was considered to be a plague on 11 March 2020.
Since October 2020, 1,61 million accurate examples of COVID-19 have been reported in 102 countries and borders, leading to 97,000 dead ones.
About 36,000 persons were correct.
The number of cases of destruction has been estimated at 4% in China, at the same time from 13,04% in Algeria to 08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and defies.
Problems may include pneumonia and acute effect diarrhoesis syndrome.
A time of exposure to the symptoms usually lasts five days, but it can draw from two to 14 days.
There is no known cure or treatment that can cure the virus.
The most effective treatment available to the patient is the effective approach to symptoms and care: Upkeeping your hands, covering your mouth while coughing, keeping distance between you and others, and being careful and isolating yourself from people who suspect that they may be involved.
The authorities around the world have responded to restrictions on travel, division, travel time, safety measures in the workplace, and parking lots.
The epidemic has led to serious economic and social upheavals worldwide, the loss or enlightenment of sports, religion, politics, and cultural events, as well as a lack of access to fast - food products.
Schools as well as universities are closed throughout the country or in 193 countries, which affects 99.4 percent of the students worldwide.
False knowledge about the virus has spread to the Internet, and there have also been cases of prejudice against Chinese people, other peoples from the East and the birth and appearance of the North Asian countries, and others from the elderly with many examples of the virus.
Because of reduction in travel rates and the number of major industries, there is a decrease in air pollution and carbon monoxide.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital city of Hubei) have reported a collection of examples of pneumonia with unknown roots in 31 December 2019, and a survey was opened early in January 2020.
Many examples have been associated with the Huanan Seafoot Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is responsible for having a genetic origin from an animal.
The virus that caused the eruption was known as SARS-Cov-2, the virus that begins to appear closely related to the cataraviruss, the coronaviruss of ngunin, and the SARS-Cov. The first known person who showed symptoms was later diagnosed as an illness in December 2019, and that person did not have any visible contact with the suitet.
In the first collection of examples reported in December 2019, three sections were found connecting to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an uncertain report from the South China Morning Post raised that the example followed back to 17 November 2019, of the 55 - year - old of the Hubei state, may be the first one. On the 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new examples are reported to be reduced in China but are growing in Italian, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new examples outside China and are still beyond the number of new Chinese.
There may be reports under examples, especially among those with cold symptoms.
By 26 February, small examples had been reported among young people, those 19 and below make up 2,4% of the world model. The chief science counselor of the United Kingdom's, Patrick Vallance, told 60% of the British community that it would require access to effective herd.
Examples refer to a number of people tested by CoVID-19, and their tests confirm the authenticity of the legal process.
Since 23 March, no country has examined more than 3% of its population, and many countries had laws to avoid testing for those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, until 23 January, 86% of coVID-19 links had not yet been found, and this unwritten link is the source of 79% of cases written under disease.
A mathematical analysis published on 30 March estimated that Italian index numbers are much higher than reported examples.
The first average birth rate ($0) of COVID-19 of 1.4 to 2.4.4.4.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are improved.
Those who are not saved, the time from the formation of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, which are so common for 14 days.
Since April 10,20, at least 97,000 deaths were placed as a reason for the COVID-19.
In China, since 5 February nearly 80% of the dead were more than 60, and 75% already have health problems that already include heart disease and diabetes. Legal mortality statistics with COVID-19 normally refer to people who have been tested and confirmed by COVID by the law.
The true number of the dead of COVID-19 may be very large, since it can include anyone who dies without checking -ib. At home, in the home of elders, etc.
A plate from Italy found that the number of deaths in the middle of the epidemic exceeds the legal deaths due to CoVID in 4- 5x.
"A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that "We know that [the value of death] is less than that", a term consistent with the reports of annecdotal study under the U.S..A. is usually associated with a virus, such as the H1N1N1 epidemic in 2009. The first deaths confirmed at Wuhan by 9 January 2020."
The first death occurred outside China itself on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death that occurred outside Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China itself, the deaths of more than a dozen were registered in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths, in all continents except Antarctica. There are a number of steps often used to calculate the rate of death.
These numbers vary from place to place, and are influenced by the size of the study, the state of medical care, the type of treatment, time from the beginning of puberty, and social factors such as age, sex, and general health. Death-to-casio shows the number of dead and divide them by the number of examples tested during a specific period.
Based on the Johns Hopkins University statistics, glogal death-to-catio is 6.0% (1997,039/1,617,204) since October 2020.
The number varies from place to place.
In China, an estimate of adeath-to-casio decreases from 17.3% (of those with symptoms appearing in 1,110 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms appearing on 1 February 2020). Some steps include acality rate (CFR), which shows a percentage of the deaths tested due to disease, and non-disputation factor factor factor (FR), which indicates the risk (IR).
These figures are not up to time, and they follow the number of people from involvement with a model solution.
A large number of scholars tried to calculate the numbers of certain people.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Education-Based Medicine measures that the general infertality of the epidemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.39%.
The highest degree of this measure is consistent with the results from the random study of CFR in Germany, and a study of statistics that review the results of CFR estimates.
WHO guarantees that the epidemic can be controlled.
The true height and length of perspiration are not guaranteed and may vary from place to place.
"Maciej Bonni of the Penn State University said, "If left unchecked, a convoluted rise decreases creation and begins to decrease when the disease disappears."
"But it is almost impossible to make a straight line as to when that will happen."
"Chang Nanshan's public health counselor said that "" may have ended in June" if all nations can make a worldwide attempt to follow WHO measures to prevent the spread of the virus."
"In 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said that SARS-Cov-2" would travel around, with force for one or two years."
"According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other measures will be required "until the solution is available (by cleaning 18 months or more)."
"Wilam Schaffner of the Vanderbilt University said, "I think it’s impossible that this coronavirus", because it is easy to pass through "that it will disappear forever" may also "turn into the seasons of the year, turning it back every year."
The storm of return will depend on the strong protection of the flock and the rate of change
The symptoms of COVID-19 may not be correct in another case and the affected persons may have no symptoms.
The most common symptoms are heat (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, flegm shape, loss of breath, muscle and joint pain, muscle pain, headaches, headaches, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cynosis. The WHO has said one of six people with severe respiratory infections and respiratory problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list that shows signs of emergency symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, chronic pain in the chest or depression, stroke in the chest, weight in the chest, and face of green or soreness; medical care is encouraged when these symptoms exist. The development of the disease in this case can lead to severe pneumonia, acupuncture of divispheres syndrome, epsis, and death.
Some of those involved may have no symptoms, no medical symptoms, but their tests ensure access, so researchers have suggested that those who have close contact with those who are assured must be near and cut off to ensure the absence of disease.
China's average for those who do not have ratio symptoms was from a few to 44%.
The general temperature period (the period between contact and development of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; usually it is five days. Setting an example of uncertainty, measuring half of the people with COVID-19 who lost their smell at first was 30% and then down to 15%.
Some details of how disease spreads are still being discussed.
The disease is believed to spread primarily between close contact and small steps formed when coughing, yawning, or speaking; when contact is about 1 to 2 feet (1 to 3 to 6 m).
Studies have found that uncovered coughs can lead the joints to a distance of up to 15 feet [4.5 m] (15 steps) to a height of 8.2 metres (27 knots).
Others point out that the virus may be transmitted by tiny particles that stay longer in the air, which can be found during speech sessions. Breathers may also be formed during breathing release, including when you speak, though the virus is usually not airborne.
Chaffeches can sit in the mouth or noses of people nearby or in case bees into the lungs.
Other methods of treatment such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory dehydratement to become heated and the result is air loss.
It may also disappear when someone touches the infected area, which includes the skin, and then touches the eyes, the nose, or the mouth.
Or there is concern that it may increase rapidly, and the danger is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of the transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 by striking the mouth after contact with the field. The virus has a risk of contact within the first three days when symptoms appear even before symptoms appear and in the final stages of the disease.
Tests were discovered three days before signals of transmission could occur before major symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of examples that do not have the confirmed marks of the body shows, but unmarkably one another has been picked up during the survey of the contact process.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reports that although it is not clear how easy the disease is, one person usually infects two or three others. The virus continues to live for hours more than days.
Initially, the virus is found up to three days in plastics (polypropylene) and 304 in stairs, a day on board cards, pumps up to four hours in the tank.
This, however, differs from the temperature and temperature level. Home animals and other animals have believed to have actually been found with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, even though British rats order that man wash his hands after touching animals, just as after contacting areas that infected people may have touched them.
SARS-Cov2 (SARS-CV-2) is the Severe acute respatery systemrovirus 2 (SARS-CV-2), which began to be separated from the three persons who had pneumonia associated with a chain of symptoms for breathing in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the new SARS-Cov-2 virus occur in a manner associated with the coronaviruss. Without the human body, the virus dies with a household nail, since it breaks its external defense. I SARS-Cov-2 is closely related to the first SARS-Cov virus.
It is because of the root of the vibration from the animal.
Genetic research has revealed that the coronavirus inherits together with the Betaconararavirus type, both subdivirus species (elineage B) and small pieces from bats.
It is the same in 96% of the overall rate of some bats. (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is a single amino acid in some parts of the chemical structure between bacteria from ngunolins and humans.
All the testing of the elements up to this day found that it may be 92% of the actual elements between the bronaravirus of ngungalin and SARS-Cov-2, enough to prove that tholils can be kept in the middle.
A viral infection may be obtained by seeing signs, even though assurance eventually comes by converting the transcripation voltase reaction (rRT-PCR) of injections or by CT photo.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan has raised that CT is far more sensitive than PCR, although its visibility is low, since most of its photographs of the group are of other pneumonia and disease processes.
"Since March 2020, the American College of Radioology recommends that "CT should not be used for investigation or for the first test of COVID-19"."
The WHO has published a series of RNA rules for testing SARS-Cov-2, first published on 17 January.
The test uses the re-time verb verbose echo echo echo echo action (rRT-PCR).
Tests may be performed by injections of breathing or blood.
The results are usually obtained within a few hours of the day.
This test is usually performed with the nasoparingal sasopingal as well as with the speechb is not in use. A number of clubs and companies promote natural leaks, capable of detecting antibodies.
Since April 6, 2020, not one of these has gone forward as sufficient to be authorized to be used everywhere.
In the US a natural test of a process developed by Clelex is authorized to be used for emergency conditions only with certificates.
The characteristics of the image of values in the radar and incompetent tomography (CT) for people who display symptoms include aisymmet peripheral color color color slides and abstenal phphrosses.
The Italian Radioological Society combines the world's international base databases to be found with images of confirmed examples.
As a result of some diseases such as adenovirus, taking photos without confirmation of PCR is limited to pointing COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the effects of CT and PCR chests and showed that although the image has little to explain infection, it is very sensitive and sensitive, which elevates considerations as an instrument for testing in areas of the epidemic.
Provolural and temporary services based on endocrinology have been developed to evaluate the properties of the virus with both radar and CT.
Antiviral measures include keeping one’s personal hygiene fully clean, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unsupervised hands, and coughing or coughing using a dry paper and inserting paper directly into the trash.
Those who may already have found it are encouraged to wear the face - to - face garment of public opinion.
Steps to physical isolation have also been encouraged to protect communication. Many governments have set limits or warned of the unnecessary travel that is coming or that comes from countries affected by the epidemic.
Yet, the virus has reached the point where it is spread to public communities in parts of the world.
This means that the virus is still spreading within communities, and other public members do not know where or how it is affected. Medical surgeons who care for someone who may be involved are encouraged to use a fixed method of monitoring, monitoring, and safeguarding the eyes. Following those affected by an important method of health authorities, they see a source of contact and preventing continuous transmission.
Using a local address card from the pocket of the government for this purpose has removed concern over privacy, Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations that produce a license that draws restrictions on this view.
There have already been a wide variety of phalhals installed or set up for volunteer service, and since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen professional teams are working with related solutions and privacy, such as using Bluetooth to insert the log of the user's attachment to others.
Users can now get the message when they have happened and get close to someone surveyed and confirmed to have COVID-19. There are round theories about how to prevent infection; for example, cleaning the nose and greedy behavior with moutwash does not work.
There is no COVID-19 solution, even though many organizations work in building it.
Hand washing is encouraged to protect the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least two seconds, especially when coming out of the toilet or stomachs are exposed to dirt; before eating; and after breakfast, cough, or sneeze.
The reason for this is that apart from the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, for it burns its protective tumor.
The CDC also encouraged the use of a hand-based to have at least 60% of alcohol in the volume if soap and water are not available at the time.
WHO encourages people to avoid touching eyes, noses, or mouth with unsupervised hands.
Areas that can be controlled by a few solutions (between one minute of radiation to kill bacteria instead of a metain cells, include 62–71% of eshanol, 50–100% of sobponol, 0.1% of sodium hypochlote, 0.5% of hydrogen peroxide, and 0.5.2.5.5-2.5% of polidone-iidine.
Some solutions, such as balelsonium chloride and chrohexide glucote, work to a low degree.
The CDC recommends that if the example of COVID is criticized or verified in such places as office or office, all places such as offices, private rooms, public places, equipment used by all the general users, lockers, keyboards, remote controls, and electronic devices used by sick people, should be killed by germs.
Health agencies recommend that people turn off their mouth and nose with a cough or a cough while coughing, or sneezing, and throwing out any diapers quickly.
Surgeons are attracted to those who may be involved, since wearing a mariki puts a limit on the amount of air - conditioning rate that slips out when you speak, yawn, and bend down.
The WHO has provided guidelines about when and how to use a mask.
"By Stephen Griffin, the virologist at the University of Leeds, "Leging can reduce the tendency [to] people to touch the face, which is the main source of contact without proper washing of hands. "Masks are also encouraged to be used by those who care for someone who may be ill."
WHO recommends that sufferers can wear skirts only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of a person with COVID-19, even though they also admit that wearing skirts can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have begun to encourage public opinion on the use of masks.
In the U.S., the CDC encourages wearing cloth instead of using health care. China directly encourages non-patient public members to use discarded medical markets, especially when you are very close to one another at three metres (3 ft) or less).
Hong Kong encourages wear surgeons ’ skirts when taking public transportation or sitting in crowded places.
Health workers in Thailand's encouraged people to make silks in homes and clean them all.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia granted legal access to the public without a mask or masking the voice and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a skirt when going to public places to protect himself and others.
The government of Austria insisted that everyone entering the food store should wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all the inhabitants to wear a crown when in public.
Taiwan, as it was producing ten million skirts a day since the middle of March, has asked the train and buses from the city to wear eye glasses in April 1.
Panama has made it difficult for you to wear a face mask whenever you go out, at the same time encouraging yourself to build a face mask at home for those who cannot afford to buy a mask.
The local masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Isolating oneself (also known as physical isolation) includes steps to control the link aimed at reducing the spread of disease by reducing contact with people.
Roads include division; travel limits; closing schools, places of work, stadiums, taxis, and shopping centers.
Individuals can take advantage of ways of isolating themselves by staying at home, dating, avoiding crowded places, greeting without contact, and physical isolation from others.
Many governments are now forcing or promoting social ditancing in those areas that are affected by the epidemic.
The high number of conferences promoted by the US government and health agencies was quickly reduced to 250 persons (if there was no circulation of COVIID-19 in the area), and later it reached up to 10 people.
On March 2220, Germany officially closed a public gathering for more than two people. Older adults and those with present health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and soldiers who are affected are faced with the risk of serious illness and problems and the CDC warned them to stay at home as far as possible in infected communities. At the end of March20, WHO and other health branches began to use the term ‘ physical isolation ’ instead of which is ‘ separating themselves from one another, so as to make it clear that it is possible to reduce the same amount of contact by means of the body contact, or contact.
"The use of the stamp" to separate itself from living together" and lead to the conclusion that people should be fully involved in the separation of the rest, it may encourage them to continue contact with others in different ways. Some authorities have published guidelines for sexual health that are not in use while the plague continues. "
These include the admonition to have sex with only a roommate, who does not have the virus or the symptoms of the virus.
The isolation of home is what has been encouraged for those who have been found with CoVID-19 and those who suspect that they may be involved.
The health - care providers have issued elaborate orders to keep themselves out of the home properly; many governments have forced or promoted arrests for everyone who lives in the affected areas.
The most difficult instructions for keeping the house are passed on to those in high - risk groups.
Those who may be exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently visited the country or the vast distribution region are encouraged to wait 14 days from the time it may be the final exposure.
Attempts to control the epidemic are to block or suppress, and to reduce it.
Arrest is followed in the first stages of the epidemic and the intent is to gather and divide those involved and to set up other anticommunicable programs to prevent the disease from spreading to others.
If it is not possible to close the spread of disease, attempts are being taken to reduce the number: steps are taken to limit the spread and reduce the effects of health care and society.
Both steps can be taken at the same time.
Pressure requires more firm measures to reduce the epidemic by reducing the simplest birth rate to less than 1. The role of monitoring the outbreak of an infectious disease in an attempt to reduce the top point of the storm, known as a shock in the line.
This reduces the risk that health services are found to be frustrated and provides more time for medicine and herbs to be developed.
Efficient interventions that can control diarrhea include precautions, such as physical hygiene, wearing face masks, restraints, steps of society that aim to separate physically from schools such as blocking schools and flashing events of public gatherings; sharing in urging the community to accept and participate in such movements as cleaning; and so on the more complex steps of preventing diarrhea were taken in China when the size of turning out, such as a wide - open - air, and the rules of dissing out of towns.
Other countries have also found various steps aimed at setting a limit to the spread of the virus.
South Korea opened a public view and made a public arrest, and it issued warnings about the movement of those affected.
Singapore has operated on the financial support of those affected and imposed a high salary on those who have failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of the local masks and has imposed a measure of a medical disability. A comparison of Great Britain and the United States shows that reducing (slightness but not stoping the increase in crime) and pressure (repairing the increase) presents major challenges.
The principal downsizing laws may reduce the desperate need for health care by 2.3 and death in part, however, the conclusion may be the death of hundreds of thousands and the frustration of health programs.
Pressure may be better but needs to be stored as long as the virus continues to surround human society (or until the solution is available, if that occurs first), as exchanges burst quickly when steps are released.
Long - term intervention to suppress the epidemic has created a social and economic toll.
No drugs are specifically authorized to fight COVID-19, but efforts to build them are on the way, including testing existing medicines.
Taking medicine, drinking liquids, and rest may help ease the symptoms.
Depending on difficulty, breathing, fluid gain, and support may be necessary.
Using steroids may deny results.

A study of the perpirototry coranavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 and the SARS-CV-2 virus related to it includes methods of detecting the presence of viruses and those that see antibodies develop as a result of infection.
ART-PCR that sees a Cronavirus's existence is supported by a RT-PCR virus.
This study was specially designed to test the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
It is used to ensure the discovery of a disease that has recently passed or continues to exist.
An antibodies, serology, can be used for both the diagnosis of a person’s illness or for company employment.
An antiboy tests indicate how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too small to be prescribed or without any symptoms at all.
An accurate count of the deaths of this disease as well as the incompetence of the majority in society can be found on the outcome of the test.
In view of the average number of tests, by March 2020, there are no countries that can be trusted about the number of virus distributions in their community.
By 23 March, no country has studied more than 3 % people in its own countries and there is a significant difference in the number of tests that have been done in various countries.
These differences may have a profound effect on the reported death rates that may have been exaggerated in some lands.
With the use of the re-iformal-time system system block blocking the process, the rR-PCR, this test can be done in various ways, including the nasperarylingeal tube or sputum.
The results are usually within two hours to 2 days.
A test called RT-PCR by vocals may have the confidence only in the first church of the first state of infection.
In the future, the virus may disappear from the throat but continues to increase in lungs.
For people who have the virus tested for the second week, the other bottle starial can be removed from the bottom of the respiratory cycle by the setter or by holding a meterial, sputum, not used.
Some of the first PCR tests developed at the Coharate in Berlin in January 2020 for the use of the re-time antireformation voltage voltration , ERT-PCR, which provides the basis for the distribution of 250,000 wets by the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom has also developed a method of survey in 23 January 2020. The South Korean Kogenabinet Company promoted the PCR-based SARCov-2 to test the level of the clinic on 28 January 2020.
"Suputa "Egen"" similar to all the battery coranaviruss and RdRRP genes found only in SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI Group was one of the most critical organizations who obtained access to the National Products Administration by using the MPR-SAV-CV-2. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CCCCCCCC, the Non-CCC, the Non-CRPROPROPration-CR, the Non-CCCCCROs for the International Health Programme, the Non-CCCCCCC, use the Non-CN for the International Health Health Health Programme.
Three of the genes testic tests in the old checkways resulted in an uncertain outcome because of the ineffective classes and the minimum testing of the CDC in Atlanta, which resulted in less than 100 sabys a day that passed through the rest of February 2020.
The survey used in two sections was not found to be reliable until 28 February 2020 and until then when the district and local testing centers were allowed to begin.
This method of testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Administration. Private tests began to test at the beginning of March 2020.
5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the worldwide availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR
The Qest Diagnostics likewise made COVID-19 testing available as far as 9 March 2020
No calculation limits were announced, collection and specin analysis should be made according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 survey was improved and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VERCTOR
On 11 February 2020 this test was registered by the Federal Service for Survey in Health Care. On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic reportedly improves the type of diagnosis of COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained a FDA request for a test that could be done within 3 hours.5 hours by thus allowing a single machine to have done a test of 412 hours in 24 hours.
In March 19,20, FDA issued the Abbot Laboratories approval of critical times, EUA, to check with Abbot m2,000 policy, FDA had already given the Holocaust, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific confirmation.
On 21-March 2020, Cepheid likewise received EUA with FDA type of test for less than 45 minutes.
FDA allows a test mode to use isothermal nuclei analytic complication ochnology instead of PCR.
Because this does not require a series of cold and hot cycles, this type may provide postulates in five minutes and nagative in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 machines in the U.S. and Abbot expect to increase its diagnosis for 50,000 tests per day. A study using the hormone antibody particularly attached to the nucleopopopid protein, N protein, of ovavirus is developed in Taiwan with the hope that it can offer up to 15 to 20 minutes such results as studying in fluenza.
"A review of the March 2020 texts concluded that "CT, computer tomography is of little help in the first stages and that the CT, computer tomography, may be available before the symptoms of the disease begin to appear."
Common features of the CT include bipolar disorder.
Subpléral dominence, grazy parving, and codolation increase as the disease changes itself.
A survey comparing PCR with CT at Wuhan’s beginning point suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR but does not have details, most of which are related to other pneumonia and disease procedures.
"As for March 2020, the American College of Radioology recommends that "CT should be used for the analysis or examination of COVID-19 for the first time" as March 2020, the CDC encourages PCR to die for the first time."
Part of the ammusse in the treatment of disease is the production of antibodies as well as Igm and IgG.
These can be used to test the presence of the disease since 7 days or more began symptoms of disease, so that it can appear to be a lack of community involvement and occupational occupation. The Assays can be made up of the main tests, CLT, or pre-of-care test, PoCT.
A high level of automated systems in many medical laboratorys will be able to work with essays but their discovery will depend on the vines for their individual production.
By means of CLT, only one square of the normal peripheral bod is used, even if specimens serials are not used for immune reactions.
With PoCT, one blood specin is usually obtained by brushing the skin.
In contrast with the PCR methods, the drill action is not required before essay. On 26 March 2020, FDA introduced the 29 string names that presented this ageny as necessary and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
According to April 2020, only one method of testing permitted by FDA under the authorization of critical circumstances. At the end of March 2020, the Euromiamum Medical Laboratory Diagnostices and Epitome Diagnosis found permission for her European anti-IgG and IgA antivirus on the radar.
The testing rate is a few hundred seconds per hour, so it is much faster than the VIR RNA protocol.
The presence of antibodies is usually examined after 14 days of infection. In April, the UK found that none of the antibody disks she bought would be useful.
"Hong Kong has been given a program in which patients are suspected of living in homes," "the risk of emergency conditions to give the patient specin tube", to turn them back, and get results after a while. The British NHS has announced that it is beginning a house examination program that reduces the threat that the patient is involved if the patient is on health or the need to clean up the patient’s infection if there is available. Concerning the patient's medical condition in the treatment of OCVIFI-19, the health service, which has taken the appropriate treatment.
The facilities for driving have helped South Korea to make a very quick, focus on any country. In Germany, the National Association of Static Health Insitorence Physicians spoke on 2 March, said that it contained about 12,000 tests a day on the counter and a survey of 10,700 were conducted last week.
The cost is due to health insurance when examination is called by a doctor.
According to president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to include 160,000 checks per week.
Beginning in March 19 a driving test was given in many large cities.
Since 26 March 2020 the total of German survey statistics was unknown, for only the correct results are reported.
"The first check of the tablet indicated that from 12/20 calendar checkpoints, the total of at least 483,295 samples were tested and included 12/20 samples and 3391 samples (6.9%) when they confirmed SARS-CoV-2. IIrael, researchers at the Techin and Rambam Hospital and tested the method of testing of at least 4 fathoms and once, with the same degree of testing when a further analysis indicated by the implementation of the X1/20. The study of the SARSS-COV is known as "GI," or "GI", "GI").
Since the building was still under construction by the BGI founder Wang Jian and it took 5 days, the model indicates that the examples of Hubei would have been high by 47% and the proper cost of joining the detention would be doubled if the force of testing was not available at the time.
The Wuhan Leb is immediately followed by the albums of Huo- Yan at Shezhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 cite cities throughout China.
From 4, March 2020 the total passing of the day to a total of 50,000 tests per day. The open source, complex drawings released by the Origami Assays are opened so that they can test the symptoms of many patients up to 122 of COVILT are used only 93. These technical drawings can operate on small holes without the need for water - bearing robots.
Since March, not having enough regeant number has become a small factor in testing the majority between the EU and the UK and the US.
This led to the fact that some writers examined the procedures for testing that involved burning samples in 98 ° C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free the RNAs of more research elements. On March 31 it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now examining the number of its people looking on each Coronavirus head over any other country, and they were going well to take the test rate to reach a large part of the people.
"This has been a combination of automation power, and the purchase of poulation-scane mass-throughput laratotry from Group 42 and BGI (based on "Huo-Yan") egency function in China."
It is built in 14 days, the bridge is capable of directing tens of thousands of tests with RT-PCR on a day and the first one in the world of this working level outside China.
Various methods of testing for different coronavirus elements were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization chose a German policy of building tanks sent to poor countries without the aid of their own construction services.
The German policy was published in 17 January 2020; a policy initiated by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not found until 28 January, delayed the investigations found in the U.S.
On the contrary, experts say that the extensive discovery of research in South Korea has helped to reduce the distribution of new coronavirus.
The ability to include the tests, especially on private valves, was developed over the years by the South Korean government.
On the 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the power of tests as the best way to regulate the infection of the COVID-19. The high demand for screening in the spread of the virus caused the flow of hundreds of thousands of workers in the U.S. clubs alone, and the removal of soaps and automical categories was oppressive.
In March 2020 the China reported problems with the accuracy of its testing tanks.
"In the United States, CDC checkouts found "obses", the government removed the legal walls that had prevented the investigation. Spain purchased tickets from the Chinese Shezhen Bioesy Biotechnology Cotd, but found that the results were not correct."
The company explained that the wrong results may be due to judicial hearings to collect samples or to the proper use of tanks.
The Spanish minister said that it will produce the boats that produce the wrong results, and it will put in their nose the different packs that have been operated on by the Shezhen Bioeasy. 80% of the Czech Republic checkouts which they have purchased in China produced the wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million checkers in China were found to be suitable.
"The Prime Minister Minister raised that he should be rejected by immersion in Danube. Ateş Kara of Turkish Health Ministry said Tuwewewawake have been found in China with "the highest degree of errors" and never used." "UK bought 3.5 million checkers in China but at the beginning of April 2020 announced that they did not use it."
The survey, followed by the arrests of those found to ensure and followed by those who had contact with people who indicated their confidence in the SARS-Cov-2, the results are also valid.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, manage the two cycles of a total survey of 3,400 people, at least ten days apart.
At least half of the suspects had no symptoms, and all the examples found were imprisoned.
As the visit is delayed, this removes the new strain completely.
By a series of zealous arrests, incoming visits, investigations, and delays, the 2020 Coronavirus epidemic in Singapore is continuing more efficiently than in other developed countries, but without such heavy restrictions as forcing food shops and other sales.
Most of the events were advertised, and Singapore began to counsel residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools opened in time after vacation at 23 March.
Several countries have also been able to care for the epidemic with the enthusiasm of following one another, to embark on internal travel, to investigate, and to be closed, but to a small degree, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistics have found that countries have more research, compared with the number of the dead, have lower levels of death, which may be due to a better degree to search out those who are deprived or who have none at all.
WHO recommends that countries without the capacity to include research and with national records of limited experience with CoVID-19 send out a sure sample of the first five and ten active estimates of the COVID-19 of one of the 16 trust books of WHO will confirm the investigation.
Among the 16 trusted documents, 7 Asians, 5 Europeans, 2 African, 1 North America, and 1 Australians.
In the following chart, the column "Absolution % of Test" is influenced by a national survey program.
A world dealing with hospitals only will have more patients confirmed with % of test than a country that examines all its citizens, whether they show signs or not, other things are equal.
Washing (or washing hands), also known as handwashing, is the act of washing your hands with the purpose of removing dirt, glass, small objects, or outboards.
Cleaning your hands with soap without forgetting those ‘ critical times during the day ’ prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which combine with the process of wild [of mouth].
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as colds or colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, the underlying factors).
Five critical periods during the day when hand washing with soap are important: before and after the delivery, after washing the baby’s nose or changing the nails, before feeding the baby, and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or domestic birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child using a toilet.
In the latter case, a cough or a sneeze.
After touching an animal, animal feed, or pollution.
Medical hygiene refers to hygienic procedures connected with medical procedures.
Washing the hands before administering medication or treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands by cleaning the hands (bathogens, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially important for people who carry food or work in the medical field, but it is an important procedure even in the common community.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of colds, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; protecting the common causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing may lead to little improvement during the development of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the death rate of young people associated with respiratory and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple moral changes, such as the washing of hands with soap.
A simple action can reduce the mortality rate by about 50%.
Inflammatory methods that promote the use of soap by hand can reduce diapers in three parts, and this can be compared to using clean water in poorer areas.
The reduction of the shups in 48% can be linked to the washing of hands with soap. Self - cleaning is the only effective and inexpensive means to protect diarrhea and acute respiestation signals (ARI), as a regular process of behavior in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Minia, the main ARI, leads alone as a cause of infant mortality under five years of age, wastes about 1.8 million children a year.
The diarrhea and pneumonia are both handy in the deaths of about three.5 million babies a year.
According to UNICEF, turning hands into soap before meals and after using the toilet to become a strict routine can save more health than any single cure or medical intervention, deciding death on the cause of diarrhea by about half and death by respiratory infections.
Hand washing is often associated with other importation of waste as part of water, waste - disposal programs and sanitation (WAH).
Hand washing is also a protection from pneumonia transmitted by direct contact.
A small accident results as a result of regular washing the hands on the skin caused by the dryness of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that overheating the hands can have a side effect, with a badly damaged skin condition known as the white chezema or trodititis, which is a common factor in health - care workers.
Hand washing is also seen again as one of Obsefve-computive discor (OCD) signals.
There are five critical times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of the disease through an oral procedure: after using the toilet (dressing, setting it off), after cleaning the baby’s diapers (the changing of the nail), before feeding the baby, or after preparing food or after handling raw meat, fish, or domestic birds.
Sometimes when proper washing of hands should be followed in order to avoid transmission of the disease includes before and after care for the wound or injury; after wetting, coughing, or blowing; after touching an animal’s prey or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of washing hands with soap.
A survey of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that 38.7% of families follow the soap - washing process. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had a high level of 97 percent; the United States near 7 percent; and China at the lowest rate of 23 percent. A few of the procedures are now available to take up the practice of hand washing in emergency times. To clean hands as a group of children in other countries to improve child - care.
The "Escial Health Care Program" introduced by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the number of children’s health and education.
To remove the braces twice a year, along with regular washing of hands with soap, daily dipping with fluoride, is a national pillar.
It is started successfully again in Indonesia.
Removing the microorganism from the hide is better by taking soap into the water.
The main function of soap and cleaning is to reduce the factors that prevent the solution, and to increase sociality.
Water alone is not enough to clean the skin because oil and protein, which are soil structures, do not easily melt away.
But cleaning is done to the extent of the water flowing.
A cyst, since it is capable of reusing itself again, may keep the virus left in the first place.
A small number of studies dealing with the transmission of the virus from the infected lungs conclude that it is impossible as bacteria are cleaned up with pollen.
The CDC continues that "soil and control without hands is better."
Antibiotics are especially attractive to members of the health - care community.
To this day, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or predisposed antibiotic-restants chooses natural antigens.
However, antibacteral soaps have common symbols of antibiotics such as trilosan, a long list of desist strains of orgianisms.
Thus, even if antibiotics do not choose soap in antibiotics, they may be capable of operating in the way they are sold.
Besides the surfactant and the skin protection agent, complex structures may have acids (acceticic acid, ascoric acid, lactic acid) as the control of PH, antiprobial antibial acid, and other skin acids (alobes, vira, vialsals, orxurals). A thorough analysis of the content of the Universal of Orgon School of Public Health showed that they do not work as well as in the same way to protect the immune system.
The hot water in which hands can wash their hands does not burn to the right extent for the virus to die.
Bacteria increase when the heat of the pit is (37 ° C).
Yet, warm, soapy water works better than cold water, with soap to remove natural fat that captures soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that using warm water does not contribute to reducing microbial feeding in the hands.
Hand sanitize or antiseptic is a symbol of water - clean hands.
At the end of the 1990 ’ s and early part of the 21st century, the representatives of the hands that are made of the melting water of alcohol (also known as alcohol-bool-bad habs, antipsetic habs, or antinizers) began to gain popularity.
Many of the bases based on elopyl alcohol or athanol that was raised was combined with a hot signal such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) made it a killer, or huntant as a glycerin as a fluid, or sugar so as to make it easier to use and reduce alcohol cooling.
Hydrogen- peroxide increases the antibial function. Haninitizers have 60 to 95% killed bacteria successfully.
Alcohol rub sanizers kill bacteria, multi-drunut antisistant bacteria (MRSA and VREE), Tuberculosis, and other bacteria (including HIV, HebV, RV, nynovirus, virus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepitis).
Alcohol rubs with 70 percent of alcohol kills 99.97% (3.5 leg) by decrease, as do 35 decibels in 30 seconds after they are anointed with 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 lig less) of bacteria in the hands within 1 minute after anointing. The Handizers function well with certain bacteria.
Aninitirs made of alcohol are almost entirely useless for anorovirus (or Nowaralk) type of bacteria, the main cause of inter-alitrithitis. A sufficient antiseptic or alcoholub must be used to soften both hands.
The front and back of both hands and inside and to the back of the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or rice is dried.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention is encouraged to wash the hands instead of rubbing the thumbs of the castter, the main when it is clear that the hands are clean.
The rise in using these represent is due to their simple and quick effort to kill micro-organisms; however, they should be used to take the proper position of washing the right hands except where soap and water are not available.
Using hanks based on alcohol regularly can cause dry skin unless amollines are inserted and/or skin tissues in combination.
The process of alcohol cooling can be reduced or eliminated by inserting glycerin and/or amolients in combination.
In a medical study, hanks based on alcohol containing imollinites make a better fit of skin and dryer than soap or anti - microbial fish.
Allergic contact dermatitis, conntactial syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcool or antivisives that are available in alcohol-indol dankbs are rare.
The low condition of causeing the irritant conntact dermatitis is a fascinating sight when compared with the washing of hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless representatives are unable to wash their hands from natural objects, but they do not kill germs.
For this reason the Hands are not effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens continue to be in hand.
The success of the binitirs without alcohol depends largely on ingredients and combinations, and according to history, they are more extreme than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, the combination of nabalconium chloridide has shown the persistence and increase in anti-combinal work after anointing, in contrast with alcohol, shown to lower working level after repeated operations, may be due to the continuing reaction of the skin.
Many people in poor economic societies cannot afford soap and instead use ash or dust.
The ash or soil may work better than water, but it is less active than soap.
One of the concerns is that if soil or ash detects the pollution of micro-organisms may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, the ash is also an agent that eliminates the virus because when combined with water, it creates a mixture of alkaline.
WHO encourages ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
The proper method of washing hands encouraged by the US Centers for Disease Control for Development of Transition of antiprocession of disease includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm, cold water.
Traveling water is encouraged because standing water may be contaminated, while the cold or hot weather does not indicate the difference.
Wash your hands with adequate soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under the nails.
Syphilis bacteria in the skin, and studies show that people often clean their hands when there is soap rather than water only.
Skip down at least 20 seconds.
Breathing causes heat, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and long - term exposure removes more bacteria.
Prepare well under moving water.
Cleaning your hands in a clean environment may defile your hands
You stop with a clean towel or allow it to dry in the air.
The hands of water and mosquitoes are sensitive to pollution. The areas that are easily forgotten are six, an experience, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Immunsions and rusted nail polish can carry microorganism.
Ringer is usually encouraged to keep your hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can raise the risk of infection.
Various inexpensive programs can be made to meet the washing of hands when running water and/or soap are not available. To bring water by handing a container or drum containing a suitable opening and / or use it if needed in developing countries. In cases of limited water (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are practical procedures for handling water, such as "tippy-taps" and other types of saving money.
The Zippy-tap is a simple technique to use a rope-laid drum, and a foot-maker which gives little water into the hands and spear blades.
Hand washing is an important part of the washing process of hands, but there is a disagreement about how effective it is to dry in public toilets.
A growing number of studies suggest that the quality of paper is better with cleanliness than the electrical outlets found in the baths.
In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Westminster, London, supported by the European Tissue Smposium paper firm, compared with the quality of cleanliness found in paper, warm hands, and the latest high - pressure hands.
After washing and drying hands with hot air gas, the total number of bacteria was found to be rising at a rate of fingers in 1944 and 254% at hand pressure in 254%.
Fast air boilers succeeded in raising the total number of bacteria in their fingers by 42% and in hand pressure by 15%.
After washing and drying the hands with a sheet of paper, the total number of the virus drops by 76% and on the fingers by 77%. Scientists also take up tests that may indicate if there is a chance of contact between cleaning and cleaning facilities as a result of each dry procedure.
A fast - air buoy, which absorbs air from it at a fixed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), succeeded in pumping micro-organisms into the hand and almost involving other users and cleaning space about 15 feet [2 m].
The use of hot air is still putting micro-organisms to a depth of 0.25 feet [0.25 m] from the gas.
The paper tablets did not show any more significant sleep of micro-organisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TüV Produkt und Ult, methods of laying different hands were studied.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after the dryness of the hands were observed:
There are many designers, and hand mills have been compared to wewels.
Washing the hands with the dehydrateds is another way when you are on a journey with soap and water.
An alcohol - based Handazir must have alcohol at least 60%.
Medical cleanup was enforced long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its function (in 1846) in the hospital ward.
There are electrical appliances that operate with a signal reminding hospital personnel to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a reduction in the rate of disease by their use of it.
Medical cleanup takes about 15 seconds, using a large quantity of soap and water or a glass so that you can anoint or clean up every part of your hands.
The hands must be bandaged together by holding the fingers together.
If there is pollution under nails, a bristish can be used to remove it.
Since bacteria can live in the water in the hands, it is important to wash them thoroughly and then dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the sheet should be used to hold water shutting (and then open any exit door if possible).
This avoids further defiling your hands at those places.
The aim of washing hands in a condition to take care to remove microorganisms ("germs") and avoid passing them on.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that slacking the hands continues to be unacceptable in many medical centers, a large number of doctors and nurses continue to forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus passing microorganisms.
One study showed that washing hands in a way and other simple procedure can reduce the rate of credited blood pressure in 6 percent. The World Health Organization has published a set that shows the practice of washing hands and handwashing in the field of health care.
The instructions for the organization to clean hands can be found on its computer so that the public can see.
The return due was guided by the Whitby et al.
Shopsters can measure and ensure the washing of hands, if it is required to show and comply with the law.
The World Health Organization "have five times the washing of hands":
after blood exposure to blood/servation.
prior to the effect of aseptic, at least once
and after taking care of the patient. Applying diuretics ("en trees" or soaps "to prevent microbes") gives the power to kill in such washing hands.
That potential to kill may be needed before surgery or in cases where antibiotic-resistant operations are common. 'Packing hands for someone for the purpose of the operation, it is necessary to have a pump that can be opened and closed without hand touching, chloroxidedine or iodine wash, stile towels to dry the hands behind the washing, and other sterlee in the toilet.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and arms to the bottom, usually 2-6 minutes.
Long periods of steaming (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When moving, the water in the arm’s arms must be firmly held back from running back into the hands.
After the completion of washing the hands, the hands are stopped by a cloth or the surgical garment are worn.
To reduce the spread of infection, it is best to wash the hands or use the handbulge before and after the patient’s care.
In order to control saphylocal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from clean hands comes from the first 20% of cleaning, and that it is very small is the more available when hand washing by repeated washing is extended over 35%.
Syphilising has a three - degree effect on the rate of bacterial infection when compared to cleaning with anti-subbing. Comparing Hand-bing with alcohol-basel solution with Hashing anti-bolic anti-unsup for a man's 30 metaid time for the arcadet of the axhead containing the alcohol-d anti-sorbulbing of the non-supleid bacteria 26% higher than the anti-projectial antivial.
But soap and water work better than alcohol-bool-bad habs in reducing H1N1 influenza A Vyluenza and Closium diclicile spores in the hands. Engaging to improve hand hygiene in health - care conditions may include teaching workers by washing hands, raising the availability of alcohol-bod hadb, and the recorded reminders to the staff.
There is a need for further research to determine which methods of intervention works best in different health - care situations.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a convenient means, an important tool for achieving good health, even physical food.
Yet, lack of reliable water, soap, or washrooms in people’s homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to reach the world’s cleaning practices.
In many African villages, for example, handwashing pumps near private or public toilets are lacking, even though there are no shortcuts for building washrooms.
Yet, low washing limits may be a factor in habits that are stronger than those of lack of soap or water.
Advertising and the use of soap by hand can contribute to the development of legislation, boosting caution against the benefits of washing hands, and lead to changing society’s habits.
For this to work properly, caution and correction are essential.
A list of 70 studies has found that the methods that rely on society are effective in raising hand washing in LMICs, while social advertising campaigns are less effective. One example of advertising handwashing in schools of the UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, simple steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while other requirements for cleaning.
When relatively small measures are achieved, schools can move from one to the other and eventually to three stars.
Construction can become part of the relief effort to reduce disease and death.
Earth’s Hand Washing Day is one of the examples of projects that raise awareness in an attempt to achieve changes in habits. As a result of the plague of 2019 - 20 coronavirus, UNICEF announced the widespread use of a hand cleaner.
A few studies have considered the cost of washing hands in developing countries and the prevention of DALYs.
One review, however, elevates that the advertising of hand washing with soap cost far more than the expense of running through water and washing.
The importance of washing one’s hands in health - care care care – especially for people under less sensitive conditions like newly brought or injured soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid - 19th century by two hand cleaners: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, I've established modern nursing.
At that time many people still believed that disease was caused by bad odors called measmas.
In the 1980 ’ s, an outbreak from diet and medical - related diseases led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand washing as an important means of preventing the spread of disease.
The outbreak of the flu in 2009 and the COVID 19 in 2020 led to high caution in many countries regarding the importance of washing hands with soap in order to protect oneself from this type of infectious disease.
For example, the prelates with the text "the proper washing of hands" are placed on top of the public washrooms and private rooms in the billions of offices and airports in Germany.
The expression ‘ Cleaning your hands ’ in something, means explaining someone’s refusal to take responsibility for something or to get involved in it.
Its origin is part of the Bible in Matthew’s account when Pontius Pilate washed their hands in making a decision to beat Jesus Christ, but it has become a common expression in some English communities.
In Macbeth of Shakespeare, Mrs. Macbeth is first forced by washing his hands, trying to clear yourself of the uncleanness of thought, which represents a guilty conscience regarding the crimes he had committed and persuaded her husband to do.
Once again it was found that people, after remembering or thinking about wrong actions, often washed their hands more often than others, often appreciate the importance of washing their hands more thoroughly.
Moreover, when they are not allowed to wash their hands after that they are less likely to share in acts of the ‘ clean ’ activity, such as evolution.
Religion encourages the washing of hands for both the purpose of cleanness and the figurative. It is a symbol of the washing of hands, using water but without soap to wash the hands, is part of the ritual cleansing process that exists in many religions, including the Baka'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and the anti-talamism in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. The churches also promote the washing of hands, especially behind certain practices.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam force the washing of hands after using the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam force to wash their hands before and after food.
COVID-19 Risk Operations Controls
Risk controls instead of the COVID-19 service procedures for handling risk risk risk factors and health in preventing coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper risk management in the workplace depends on the workplace and the type of work, by contributing to the risk of exposure sources, the risk of disease in the community, and the risk to the individual workers who may be weak in preventing COVID- 19.
According to the U.S. Regional Safety and Health Administration (WHO), low - risk activities have a degree of social contact with other employees, which simple protective measures are encouraged, including washing the hands, encouraging the staff to stay at home when they are sick, breathing habits, and maintaining cleaning and bacterial procedures in the workplace.
Work that can be exposed to an inner danger includes those that require regular touch and near people who are not known or who are suspected of having CoVID-19, but they may be infected because of constant social contact or foreign visits.
This includes workers who are able to contact the public like schools, crowded farms, and market conditions.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to simple measures, include high -finciency antivirals, sneezing guards, and preprocessive environments available in cases where COVID-19 can be found.
WHO views health - care workers who are exposed to prominent people or suspected of having COVID-19 as a higher risk of exposure, which rises to a higher risk of exposure if the staff creates aerool-generation procedures, or spreads or carries spicines from prominent or suspected persons.
Proper risk control in these operations includes building systems such as nagative entoms, and the personal protactive function.
The development of the*COVID-19 may have serious side effects within the service area.
Employees may be absent from work because of sickness, the need to care for others, or because of fear of being exposed to it.
Business practices may change, with both the kind of equipment needed, with the means to obtain these goods (such as free time - consuming shopping or transportation or the services of driving).
Finally, the transfer of items from the affected areas of COVID-19 may be interrupted. Preparing for a related disease and an respond program can be used to regulate the protective actions.
Programs focus on the risks involved in different workplaces and the type of work, including exposure to the kind of enlightenment, risks to the home or the social environment, and the hazards of individual workers as advanced age or chronic illnesses.
They also explain the proper control in order to meet those dangers, and the following scenarios of situations may arise as a result of an eruption.
The preparation of a related disease and emergency programs may depend on the promotion of national or regional law.
The purposes of responding to an emergency include reducing staff pressure, protecting people from higher risk of serious health problems, keeping business activities, and reducing serious effects on other businesses and consumers.
The impact of the disease on the community affects the response steps taken.
Risk-control ladders are the general public-based safety and health to combine risk control with the results.
When the dangers of COVID-19 are not removed, the best control is the building control, followed by control, and finally the self - defense equipment.
Construction management involves separating workers from work - related risks without relying on a worker’s habit, and it can be a step that can save much money when put into it.
Commands to handle changes in the operational or procedures required by the employee or employer
Personal protensive development (PPPE) consider it to be more efficient than building and controlling control, but it can help to avoid exposure to something.
All forms of PPP should be chosen based on the worker's risk, appropriately worn as proper (e.g., lookpers), always and in a manner, checked, maintained, and modified, according to the need, and properly cleaned, and kept or discarded.
According to the U.S. Orological Safety and Health Administration (WHO), low - risk jobs have little contact with society and other peers.
The simple measures to protect the bacteria that are encouraged in all workplaces include many washing hands and diligently, encouraging workers to stay at home when they are sick, good breathing habits that include coughing and diapers, salvesing, preparing for work or running errands in the workplace, encouraging workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and to keep up the routine cleaning and killing germs in the workplace.
Early detection and the possible isolation of people with a virus play an important role in protecting employees, customers, watches, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with acute respirotry in the home should stay home until they are no longer warm, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of heat - reducing medications or changing symptoms, and that the rules of the days of illness are frightening, allow the staff to stay at home to care for the sick family member, and that the personnel know the rules.
According to WHO, among other activities include such activities that require constant contact or close to six stages (1.8 m) with unknown or imagined cases of COVID-19 cases, with SARS-Cov2 because of ongoing social unrest near the workplace, or for the reason that someone has just returned from a foreign land where there is a wide distribution by COVID-19.
These include staff members associated with public services such as schools, high public - level centers, high - level trade rates, high - risk communications systems. To create high - level security systems include installing ladders, raising platforms, installations as platforms, and installations for application systems, and operating systems. The control control over this vast group includes promoting operating systems, including operating systems, operating systems, operating systems, operating systems, and operating systems, operating systems, operating systems, and operating systems that include operating systems, operating systems, and operating systems that include operating systems, operating systems, operating systems, and operating systems that include operating systems that require operating systems, and operating systems that require operating systems, and operating systems that require operating systems, and operating systems that require that require operating systems, and using advanced limits.
Employees in the rescue team rarely need to use helicopters.
If a person begins to get sick in a plane, proper control programs to turn off workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by a distance of six steps, putting one member of the row to take care of the sick, and giving a face mask to the patient or asking the sick person to put his mouth and nose off when he or her nose.
The kitchen bed should wear gloves when caring for a sick passenger or affects the body’s fluids or areas that may be contaminated, and it may be that more things are needed for protection if the patient is hot, chronic coughs, and breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other losses should be discarded by a biozard, and areas that have found pollution should be cleaned and killed by bacteria later. As for merchant ships, including travel ships and other passengers, control can include slowing travel when you get sick, and disassembling the center immediately if someone begins to warm or other symptoms while riding.
If possible, the follow - up must be affected by a separated student. In schools and day - care facilities, the CDC recommends temporarily closing for the purpose of cleaning and killing germs if the infected person has ever been inside the school building at any cost.
If there is little in contact with society, social isolation techniques may be started as fueling the fields trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as natural education, classrooms or meals, increasing space between desks, half - and - times flights, calling out to strangers, and using a different health office with symptoms like a cold.
When the virus is spreading in a significant way in the community, in spite of human isolation efforts, it may be suggested that closed schools are closed. For lawmakers who perform daily duties, health risks are then considered lower by the CDC.
Legal workers who have to contact with people who are confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 are encouraged to follow similar guidelines with health - care workers, including the proper safety measures of a person.
If there happens to be a close relationship when one is found, workers should clean up and remove germs from their work belts and clothes before reuse them with a spray or household washcloth, and follow the usual methods to prevent the spread of the virus and the disposal of PPPE and to keep and washing clothes.
WHO estimates that some medical and cold workers are at greater or greater risk of infection.
The activities of the most vulnerable include those who send medical supplies, relief supplies, mines, and medical personnel that are exposed to known patients or that are suspected of having COVID-19.
These become the greatest risk of exposure to disease when workers perform procedures that produce aerosol, or collect or treat samples, from well - known patients or have doubts that they have COVID-19.
The mechanisms that form aerosol include the implanting of the tube, the process that causes coughing, bronchcopies, procedures and tests of teeth, or the gathering of body tests.
Inflammatory operations include workers involved in preparing bodies for people with known or suspected deaths; these become extremely dangerous when testing bodies. More and more of these dangerous groups include private rooms known as COVID-19, which include the development of aerosol.
Special airwayways with a pressure pressure may be appropriate in some medical and inflammatory satellites.
The samples should be weighed by the safety guidelines of Biosafer Livel 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that new patients be separated into different waiting positions depending on whether there are doubts as to whether they have COVIL-19. In addition to PPE, OCA encourages epiators from those who work around 6 degrees and well - known patients, or who have fears, that they have SARS-Cov-2, and those who develop procedures that produce aerosol.
In the United States, N95 or better convincing face masks are authorized by NIOSH must be used as a complete written defense system, which includes a diagnosis of health, exercise, and medical testing.
Some types of epipirators may be more likely to protect and improve the worker’s mood. WHO does not encourage coveralsies, since COVID-19 is a disease that comes from breathing rather than through fluid transmission.
The WHO recommends only the operational staff in the operating areas.
To those who collect chrophylling, caring, or transport COVID-19 patients apart from aerosol development techniques, WHO promotes surgery, port, or fce oxids, gear, and gloves.
In the case of aerosol development process, N95 or FFP2 is replaced by a surgical procedure.
Because PPPE is not available enough in the world, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE by telephone contact with patients, special prohibitions such as windows, allowing only those who are directly involved in the treatment to enter the hospital with COVID-19, use only the necessary PPPPE for a particular job, continue to use the same virus without removing it while caring for many patients who have the same disease, under control and control the availability of PPE, and prohibiting the use of the treatment to persons who have no symptoms.

DEPARTMENT: [Covid-19] To reduce the burden and prepare for the future
THIRD/ATC: 14 March, 2020, 00: 24.
BRANCH OFFICE: CC0: No privileges specified
We find ourselves in a momentous situation in this month.
The disease of COVID-19 is a factor that makes clear how people in the world are related to the burden we have on each other.
We have never faced similar challenges, but we know that our reaction is closely related to the kind of fellow feeling on earth, good cooperation, and the building of society.
Cooperating and caring for one another in all our employees through mail, telephones, and chat rooms is a remarkable guarantee that we have good people with whom we work.
I am really happy and proud to work with you.
Last week, someone told me how much he appreciated our work.
He reminded me how reasonable it is for the earth to be able to open Wikipedia right now, and this is a powerful symbol of this vital source to be found regularly on the Internet and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep the network open or our workers paid for or protected our communities.
The world needs knowledge from Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is the time when not only what we do but also how we do it will affect the earth greatly.
In view of the importance of this work and your role in it, we will make significant changes in our relationships, starting with the preceding night.
Changes in our work and expenses
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the bar - c has assembled that evening to discuss how we will work with our days and months to come.
In that discussion, we have considered what we felt would be a good response to our situation and how the best way to keep the organization going during this period.
We should not expect them to remove the pressure and support our long - term goal.
If you need to drive the car again, that’s OK.
Of all the workers, the companies of the treasury, and the service:
Our expected daily work will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until the change is announced.
We do not announce holidays if you can work longer hours, if you can use a company.
However, things are uncertain in the world now, and whether you need to care for your loved ones, buy food, or go to a doctor, your health comes first.
We cannot follow a time that is in full swing.
If you are sick, do not become inactive.
There is no need to say this, but we will.
You don’t have to put sick days or PTO - you will simply tell your manager and help your work crew to edit calendars and checkouts to ensure that the main parts of the work are being accomplished.
(If it is found that you have a COVID-19 virus, please tell Bryan between T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure that your condition is properly cared for by the management).
Workaholics will be fully paid.
We already say it, and we plan to fulfill our obligations to our employer and to those that work hour after hour.
Everyone will be paid according to his normal working hours.
This includes your being sick and able to work.
If you want to work, we have support.
Many people use work as a means to bring their stress into line with the things around us.
What we do can have a unique reward, especially at times like this.
Again, it is important to take care of yourself.
We invite you to contact your manager, so that we can know what to expect and plan accordingly.
Some work is considered important.
There are things we must continue doing.
SRE packets, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundrasing (in some others) perform sensitive tasks that may need additional support.
We will begin the process with every door to explore current goals and minimize the importance of supporting what is important in our goal.
There is much that all of us need to do, and we will only concentrate on the more important products.
Keeping the pace now will not hurt us later.
We don't sit to "work double to hold the shijuli" after the epidemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to complete the work at an extraordinary time right now.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work on setting new goals and new times when they are convenient.
What happens with the APP (Annual Planning)?
To adjust to our new circumstances and the hours of work that we are awaiting each day, we are determined to change the time of our yeartextal Plan for 20-2021.
Our goal is to suggest the introduction of our 2019-20s program that allows more time to make a budget allowing workers to take the initiative, care for themselves, and take care of their loved ones while assisting those who need or wish to work less cheese in the next few weeks.
This downsizing of the working age greatly reduces the present job schedule and the pressures in the entire organization.
We will introduce what we are considering to Bhodi about the next week and will repay representatives and arrests on the next steps as soon as we have the assurance.
Thank you for taking the lead in this respect.
Office status, exposure, and cleanup
Last week, we learned that one of our SS personnel may be exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
Out of great concern, however, we sent a clean - up group by removing germs from all parts of the San Francisco office.
Use antiviral soap to remove germs everywhere, as well as from the tourist and elevator compartments that penetrate our area.
The building uses its own nursery to provide care by using products that support the safety of its owners.
We feel free to do the same when we decide to go back to the office.
Our DC office is in Werk, which had its COVID-19 and all the staff in DC.
Since last week, our DC office has moved to a remote area that has been completely cut away according to direction given by San Francisco.
As our other deserveC staff knew, we had been talking about renting property in Brooklyn.
These discussions persist but may take some time.
Some of our workers worked far away for the first time.
Our long - time servants know that it can be a big change, and they want to give you some advice:
Cut back on the number of meetings by at least one or two hours.
If you need extended meetings, consider how you can divide them in several days.
Make clear what the meeting is about, go with it, and send out the information that has to be read in advance.
Do this with video, such as Google Docs and Zoom, so that you can work and communicate directly.
Take the lead in arranging all the meetings, someone who will look up questions and follow up on the list of speakers, and someone who will help write notes (or write notes in all of you).
Send e-mail to assist them with technologies if you need a better message.

The HR Operation Group requires guidance from the Internet network in effective methods to support the increase in the work which is sent to the rest of the Society.
In the past week we have asked all those who receive high wages from society to highlight the social events supported by Wikimedia, such as Tedthans, WHO, to announce that the epidemic is over.
We will tell them that we have understood that our appeal for lights and other restrictions would make it impossible to complete their rental tasks and that no one would be rewarded by drinking or changing those goals.
In the coming week we will follow another direction to the Wikimania and other regional and regional public records.
The general feeling of the world’s population seems to be confused but to be relieved by explanation and opportunities to focus on their communities, Wikimedia, and so forth.
In time, the CRT works to map the page to Meta-Wiki to give the public space to check the existing input and follow up our discussions with them.
Keeping in contact with issues related to CoVID 19
We'll send an invitation to your calendar next Thursday, at 14 UTC/07:00 for a special meeting of workers.
We will use the time to share some comments, to answer your questions, and to spend some time together.
We work together and will help you wherever we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive information for this mail, and for all the other underlying information of CoVID-19 related information, to the Office Wiki.
The CRT will save these loose pages and all information stored in one location.
We also work to keep regular contact with workers who live in countries now seriously affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, the highway of a large activity, the challenge of the jury, and anything else you might need to help, please tell and work with the CRT.
We are here to help support and communicate when needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive subject, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judaan - Prince of the HR International Global Policy Operations.
None of these changes should be viewed as giving up work and our obligations.
Rather, they are aware that in this time, our work and obligations will likely need to be adjusted in a way that never has been done before.
These steps, they believe, are needed to support one another in order to carry on the work, to give our group support that they need, and to give the world a reliable service.
The work we do will be ready when the time comes.
In the meantime, it is time to support one another and to build up a space of vital work that may be available in the weeks and months to come.
We need all of you to make that happen, so we need to care for yourself and your family in order to be fully prepared when the need arises.
Now, please -- Wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Maanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime L, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), as well as the entire Laabaoli Guard (Grant I, Heather W, Jaine V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The b'Antisin-convering initente 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme sitting out (in the cell) of cells in the lungs, muscles, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
The ACE2 works against the use of angiotsin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the number of angiotinin-III and raising Ang(1-7) to make it a promising medicine for heart disease and blood. ACE2 also serves as a place to enter cells into certain corvrus cells.
A person’s type of enzyme is usually referred to as hACE2.
Angiotsin-concentring 2 is a metantallomyme that is found in the faces of an endolial and other cells.
The ACE2 protocol contains the N-terminal index M2 and the C-terminal key should not be a specific antialiasing machine.
The ACE2 is a type of synapses, with its enzymes that are exposed to the face of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer layer of the ACE2 cell is separated from the castmbrane by the enzyme known as shedhes, and the elastic protein that occurs is released from the blood and eventually results in the urine.
ACE2 is present in many body components: ACE2 is linked to a component of the cell's primary type 2 cells in alvelar, entrocytes in small tubes, solar cells and venous endocrinous cells in many body cells.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in cerbal cortde, stritum, hypothamus, and brainstein.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE Secretary.
The ACE divides angiotsin I to vasostricting iotsin II.
ACE2 divides carbon-parxyl-paramino acid phenylone from angiotsin II (Arsg-Arg-Tal-Hil-Hil-Hil-Hil-Hip) and then splits it into vassorial sooten (1-7), (H-H-Arg-Arg-Val-Tr-H).
ACE2 can also divide several other Paptides involving[des-Arg9]-bradykin, apelin, neurutensin, dysorphin A, and ghrelin.
The ACE2 also regulates the movement of the nautral amino acidser SLC6A19 and is linked to Hartnup syndrome.
As a trombrane protein, ACE2 works as the main entrance to certain coronavirus cells, including HCov-NL63; SARS-Cov (SARS virus); and SARS-Cov-2 (COV-19).
Significantly, the combination of SARS-Cov proteins and SARS-CV2 in the erythrome of ACE2 cells in the face of cells results in endostoosis and in the course of both the virus and the enzyme to the endorsome cells.
This process of entering also requires that the S protein worked with the proteasse TMPRS2, a barrier under current test as a cure for disease. This has led some to conclude that reducing the right cells of ACE2, to cells, can help fight the virus.
However, many prominent organizations and working bodies encourage continuing with the general ACE prevention and treatment by ARB.
"The review and analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "to use ACE vaccines was associated with a significant 34% reduction in pneumonia risk compared with Controls."
"On the other hand, "Pinemonia risk has been reduced to patients treated with ACE's vaccines that have been in high risk for pneumonia, especially those of both side and heart disease."
"The use of ACE vaccines has also been associated with a reduction in patients dying from pneumonia, although the results were less serious than the damage pneumonia can cause."
The combination factor for man ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a new treatment for serious lung damage, and it seems to improve the pulmonary hemodymics ’ release of oxygen from the polysaccharide-incid antis syndrome.
One half of the rhACE2 people spend 10 hours working and begin working 30 minutes more than 24 hours.
One study shows that rhACE2 can be the right medication for those who cannot drink anti-renantiots inhibitors (RAS inhinators) are not common or in cases when angiotin II scans. ArhACE2 has been examined in medical research for treating an antistrocents syndrome.
"BOVID-19" is a youth software program designed to help you identify numbers regarding the 2019-20 coronavirus epidemic, such as the process of finding people ("" which are infected ") that may have been associated with an infected person."
Several programs have been developed or contemplated, with government legislation in other places.
It has been developed for the construction of the portable ladders.
Secret anxiety has been expressed, especially with regard to trains based on the location of the applet users.
Other ways that do not require confidential knowledge include using the coins in Bluetooth to replace user user in other youths.
On April 10, 2020, the Google and the applet announced that they would build a way to support such accesss in Bluetooth directly on the OS on Android and IOS.
In China, the Chinese government, dealing with Ailipay, has developed an App that allows citizens to check whether they have contacted people with CoVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an App is used by TraceTwether.
"This is established by local IT servants, released as an open spring and will be given to the government. In North Macedonia it was released "Stop Korona!", the applet working with Bluetooth to follow exposure to people who may have an infection and to be given immediate response to health resources."
The App was established by the Association of Technology and the Medical Department.
Since April 14, 2020, this applet was expected to be authorized by the Google Place and the Applet Appetee.
"By April 12, the government stated that the pelvicip was in a advanced stage of development, and it would be possible to get out of a few weeks. For the same applet in Ireland, and in France ("StopCoved ").
Both Australia and New Zealand consider the App based on the Singapore A.TraceTwether and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia has intended to establish an Ap when crossing the limits set for patients who have CoVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they are not out of their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, lists a number of factors that may be a problem with the apples, including misleading warnings and opportunities to ignore warnings if an applet is limited to a small number of people.
"To solve problems associated with the oversquarters' running "Coronavirus" is misleading or dangerous, the Applet sets limits on the types of organizations that can enter the Cornovirus desktops into its Applets, he said it will be only those "authorized" or trusted organizations.
The Google and the Amazon have established similar boundaries.
Secret - seeking partners have expressed their concern about the problems of transporting a multitude of people using corranaviruss, especially in regard to that the transportation program established to deal with the coronavirus epidemic will be launched after the crisis has passed.
The Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a stamp that sets limits on this type of search.
These organizations set out nine conditions for government projects:
"Gamilation should be "lical, required and suitable"
the timing of the watch and movement should have aspects of eclipses;
the use of the radar should be limited to the purposes of CoVID 19;
the protection of sand and unknown names will have to be protected and displayed as a protection based on evidence;
The study of it should avoid reducing the evils of prejudice and reducing the value of things;
any sharing of land with other people will be required by law;
must be careful against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
"A practical contribution to all "Snivers" will be required, including public health experts and small groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter orhne Gang) (RSF) also produce tests.
The Google/Appled program aims to correct the problem of regular tracking by launching an OS processing operation when no longer required.
Some countries that used space travel based on a network rather than on an applet, thus eliminating both the need for an application and the avoidance of access.
In Israel, a network-based sequence was authorized.
The solutions based on the network that can reach the gap of the undivided land can have serious private problems.
Not all industries, however, have large clinics to get to the bottom of the human environment; the number of private - defense mills has been built using large bridges to connect only (see paragraph below).
In South Korea, a mast not based on the App was used to follow the person.
Instead of using a fixedapp, the mill collects information to various sources that involve a track of a small diagonal and a credit card, and combines this to send messages with text messages to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this knowledge to warn people that they may be infected, the government has also made community knowledge available to the public, which is allowed because of many changes in private laws after the outbreak of the MerRS in the country.
This information has a public advantage over the Apps and satellites. Germany's countries have considered the use of both the giant masts and those that protect privacy.
Since April 6, 2020, details have not yet been published.
A search for privacy is a well designed method, which contains many research books from as early as April 2020. Since July 7, 2020, more than 12 professional groups are looking for solutions that accept privacy, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to contact the user with other young people.
However, PAPP-PT is an attempt to connect between both major and various ways, and it is not one protocol. Various protocols include Dentralized Privacy-Priving Promoty Trafficing (DPPT/DP-3T), Temory Contactmens (TCN, FCKA Contactant Eve Numbers,EN), Privismistive Protocols and Meration for Contactos and Other.
In these proteins, the visible human star never leaves the garbage, and all contact takes place.
The Prevacy Group at MIT Media Lab has always developed Safpaths, a platform for the use of privacy protection platforms when collecting and using the location or stairway to follow the development of the COVID-19.
"It is based on a study from the white page "Apps Gone Rogue: Mathining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another attempt is the SafeTrace Board of Enigma MPC, a company that developed a code of privacy that was first developed in MIT Media Lab."
The SafeTrace uses safety radio technology to allow users to exchange for a critical environment and health and other users and lawmakers, without endangering the data.
On April 5, 2020, the worldwide TCN Coalition was developed by groups connected with what has been the same pattern as the most diverse, with the goal of reducing divisions, and allowing the worldwide use of transverse and warning guides, an important feature in the general reception.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that he had issued an invitation to the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government.
On April 10, 2020, the Google and Apple, the young Android and IOS firms, announced the way to attract people, and asserted that they would protect privacy, based on the combination of the Bluetooth Low Energy and cy cannotptoography technology.
They also publish technical features used on the mill.
In line with the Applet and the Google, the mast is intended to be removed in three stages:
To allow governments to build legal access access to a corranavirus protection system
A direct application of this item to the IOS and Android Google and Applet to correct problems of starting and monitoring by sending the mast first with OS returns, and then to remove it similarly after the threat has passed.
The b'Drug reposition (also known as reuse, re-profiling, re-suscitation or vitching) is to reuse the known medicine for treating another disease or a different health condition from which it was built.
This is the type of scientific research that is currently known to develop for the development of safe and effective forms of COVID-19.
Other research guidelines include the development of the COVID-19 goal and the transfusions of the Compution Plasma. SARS-Cov-2 are about 66 proteins that are able to use the medicine, each of which has a number of connections in the molecules.
The analysis of the data in which they are combined creates a rational protein to develop an antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
In the most important proteins in SARS-Cov-2 are protease such as the ppain, RNA polymerase based on RNA, herecese, S protein, and ADP ibphosphatase.
Hussein A, and others research several medicines that can be used and improved by the equivalent of their building with the same high - tech drugs to speed up the development of a powerful drug called SARS-Cov-2 in this research research that can be used as a research tool.
chloroquine is a treatment for malaria that has also been used for certain physical ailments.
On March 18, WHO announced that the chloroquine and the related hydroxychloquine will be among the four trees studied as part of the mixed medical research.
New York district president Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York district study of chloroquine and hydroxychloquine will begin on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydroxyxylologone sulfate and chloquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
The treatment has not yet been authorized by the FDA medical research and is adopted only under EUA as a medical method that will be used for emergency conditions for hospital patients but who are unable to accept treatment in medical research.
"CDC" has said "to use, volume, or hyperoxyxyloloquine in Prophylaxis or SARS-Cov-2" is not correct.
"Doctors have used medicine where "no alternative" is."
The Turkish research team in Istanbul does little research on the use of chloroquine combined with zic, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Much research continues at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
YYYgone Medical School does research on the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloquine to prevent disease.
"China medical research in Wuhan and Shenzheen says that the favivivivir "are really practical."
Thirty - five patients in Shenzhen were found to be very active in a test during 4 days, while the length of the illness was 11 days for 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study carried out at Wuhan for 240 pneumonia patients, the half was given a favipavir and the other half to memifenovir.

In accordance with the South China Morning Post, Shinzo A has introduced himself to the Trump party on the purchase of medicine. A medicine may not be completely effective in the most severe cases of infection where the virus has been repeated.
It may not be safe to use it in pregnant women or when they try to get pregnant.
"A further study of loginar/ritoravir (Kaletra), a combination of antiviral drugs, and lopibinar and ritovir, concluded that "no profit has been found"."
These trees were designed to prevent HIV from multiplication by contact with proteas.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado tries to change drugs to get the fluid that will meet the SARS-Cov-2. There are critics in the scientific community by directing efforts to reuse the drugs specially designed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO is involved in the loginar/ritovir in a combined study of the world.
The Remdesibir was built and developed by the Gilead Sciences as a cure for Ebola virus and Marburg disease. The Gilead Sciences found that Remdesiver had work to fight the virus against the virus - epilo-, pneummo-, paramyxo-famy, and corona-f.
One problem with antiviral treatment is to develop a metastasis that can lead to a serious and infectious disease.
The first study suggested that remdesivur may have a high genetic barrier to the use of medicine. There are several ongoing medical researchs, including two of which are carried out at Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with moderately ill health and one for the worst.
There are three ongoing medical studies of vitamin C for hospital patients with COVID-19; two vaccines (in China, Canada) and one under control (Italy).

The low - weighted hepan is widely used for treating patients, and it also led the Italian Medicine Agency to print guidelines for its use.
A study of a number of 300 patients who studied the use of enoxapar sodium in preventive measures was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-Cov-2 is a virus, scientists have concentrated on re-use antiviral drugs that were developed by previous infections such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribabilin: libababirin was referred to for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with 7 Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: imifennovir referred to COVID-19 in accordance with 7 Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been found to be reuse in COVID-19:
Tocizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Courtesy in China.
In Italian and Chinese studies, and look at Tolikizumab#COVID-19.
The goal of the b - A COVID-19 is the supposed goal against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no end to medical research, there are many ongoing efforts to establish such a goal.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect that the goal of SARS-Cov-2, the cause virus, should be achieved within 18 months.
Five vaccines were held in the Department of Safety Research in April.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
The great explosion spread around the world in 2020, leading to a huge project of finance and research to establish a goal.
Most organizations use genes to establish goals that can be made for SARS-Cov-2.
Since April, the basic elements of the CAPI project are fast, broken, produced, and accessible on earth.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technical platforms have been studied and developed at the beginning of 2020 to build a practical goal against CoVID-19.
The functions of large platforms that advanced in the public security survey I include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Orderna's author I and goal code: Moderna, mRNA 1273)
viral vctor (the founder of Article I and base of the object: CanSino Bilogics, adenvirus type 5 ctor)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 elements are in the first phase of the goal development, and 78 are confirmed as non-projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 were announced, but there is very little public knowledge available (perhaps or developed).
The II II study safety before the use and fight against the virus, usually not planned, is controlled by a bullet, and is in many centers, while more accurate, active amounts are considered.
A study of Volume III usually involves more participants, including a group of control group, and the application of the goal tests to prevent disease, while serious results are being made with the right amount.
"To the 79 objectives established (as early as April 2020), 74 have not yet been examined in the public (who are still in the study "before" treatment").
On the 24th day of January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is studying whether it is possible to be used for a molecular structure that will alter the genes that have the virus to be treated.

In March 2020, the government, industry, and three US universities combined the equipment to obtain large IBM computers, combined with computer software from Hewlett Packerer, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some goals have the effect of other forms of life, which are also called vague results.
That means it can have a long - range effect on the disease they are fighting.
One unpredictably survey in Australia seeks to register 4,170 health workers.
Goals may not be running out of fuel.
The first study of design testing is used by animal models of CoVID-19, such as the erythropic mouse, other animal species, and similar to humans, showing the need for protection against the virus 3 in handling bacteria, and working with other countries to ensure the safe processes that operate everywhere.
SARS and MERS goals have been examined in animal models.
Since 2020, no solution or SARS safety goal has proved safe and effective for people.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and introduction of new goals and medicines in SARS was a major concern of government and public health insurance worldwide. And no goal has been achieved by the MERS.
As the MERS advanced, it was believed that current SARS research could provide a useful system for developing goals and treatments for the MERS-Cov virus.
Since March 2020, there has been one goal (DNA) of the IMARS medical research team, and the other three are still being studied, and all are the goals of theviral-vector, adnoviral-vector (CADO1-MARS, BVS-GamVVVAc), and one MVA-vector (MVA-SSS).
The communications stations promote the idea that the virus causing COVID-19 is known and that the goal is already achieved.
The ends quoted from the various communications centers refer to the already existing genetic bases and the goals of other coronavirus relatives like SARS coronavirus.
The b b'Conavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a related virus caused by erre respatery syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and denial.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, painful throat, breathlessness, and stomach pain.
The time from the early exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually five days but from two to 14 days.
While most of these cases result in the symptoms of disease, others result in the rising pneumonia and death of many organs.
Since April 17, 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 5686,000 people have recovered. This virus is mostly spread among people who communicate, usually with tiny droplets that slip from your coughing, coughing, or speaking.
Although these droplets occur when you breathe, they usually fall on the ground or items instead of being bacteria in long distances.
People may also be infected and touch the infected environment and touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live in objects about 72 hours.
It is more frequent during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, though it may rise before symptoms of disease and later strains of the virus. The usual method of testing is the transversation plyrase cin verb (rT-PCR) through the pit.
The use of masks is encouraged for those suspected of being infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Tips for society’s use of a mask vary, some authorities say that they are not used, others say they are not, and still others force it to be used.
At present, there is no specific goal or treatment against the COVID-19 virus.
The transmission of the virus has been found in many countries throughout the six domains of WHO.
Those infected with the virus may have no symptoms or symptoms such as fever, flu, fever, fatigue, and denial.
Symptoms of an emergency include breathing difficulties, chronic chest pain or stress, confusion, difficulty in getting up, and face - to - face, and misdiagnosis; a doctor’s help is encouraged as soon as the symptoms appear.
Strange as it may be, the signs that affect breathing above the surface are like a nose, noses, or sore throat may be visible.
Signs of disease from mouth to mouth, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been seen in different percentages.
Other conditions in China first created only chest firmness and heart rate.
In others, disease can develop into pneumonia, kill most of the organs, and kill.
This is also called the age of symptoms.
The period of symptoms of COVID 19 usually lasts from five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
The 97.5% of cases of disease develop during 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of those who do not have symptoms in passing on to others is not fully recognized; however, current evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The number of infected people who do not display symptoms of disease is currently unknown and studied, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected have been without symptoms while lying in the hospital.
China’s National Health Commission began to include symptoms of the disease in its daily numbers on April 1; of the 166 who were infected that day, 130 per cent (78%) had no symptoms for the diagnosis.
Both the heel and the chest can contain the virus.
A comment above brings out a number of notes rather than the usual tone.
A study in Singapore found that a flattening without a cover can lead to up to 15 feet [4.5 m] of steps.
Although the virus is usually not passed through the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it can be transmitted by a breath and that the air packs outside the public rooms released samples of the RNA virus.
Certain medical procedures, such as the introduction of the tube and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the production of particles to be removed from the air and resulting in the swelling of the breath.
While there is concern that it can be spread, this danger is thought to be minimal. The virus is highly contagious when people have symptoms; although an outbreak may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is minimal.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easy it is for a virus to develop, one person usually involves two or three persons. The virus lives for hours to days in things.
In particular, it was found that the virus lives for one day on a board, about three days on plastics (pollypropylene) and iron (Asi 304), and about four hours in a room of 99%.
This, however, varies from humidity to temperature.
The soap can also be useful if used properly; soap products reduce the protective membranes of the virus, kill it, and remove it from the skin and elsewhere.
Some soaps, such as balelsonium chloride and chloroxine glucote (the bacterial virus of the surgical area), do not work well. In Hong Kong research, samples were taken two days after the first hospital stay.
Of the 5 out of 6 patients, the first test showed the number of high virus, and the sixth of the patients showed the number of high virus on the second day was tested.
SARS-Covilitation syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most severe form of terratomy syndrome coronavirus, which is first released from three persons infected with pneumonia who contracted most of the most serious respiratory infections in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-Cov-2 virus are derived from the coronavirus virus.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, producing its protective membrane. SARS-Cov-2 is closely linked to SARS-CV.
The lungs are the most affected to COVID-19 because the virus enters the main cells by the enzyme antuitin-consing enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is largely found in the type II of alvelar in the lungs.
"A virus uses a special glycoprotein called "sipke" (ppllomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the primary cell.
A severe heart injury was found among 12% of infected persons who are hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and are more likely to occur in serious diseases.
The levels of the symptoms of high carbohydrates, resulting in a stroke and immune infection during an attack, but a heart attack may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are very evident in the heart and are involved in the operation of the heart.
The thrombosis factor (31%) and venous sthromboelism (25%) is found in the ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be related to weak prognosis. COVID-19 people killed by COVID-19 have shown difuse alevener mite (DAD), and an outbreak of lymphoccytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a stroke of the ACE2-pressing respiratory system, patients with COVID-19 have the most critical symptoms of synthesis hypoperflammation.
In particular, PCCS-CSF-secting T-cells appear to be in line with the finding of IL-6-secreting monocytes and the causes of serious disease in patients with COVID-19.
Cymphocycies have also been reported during autopsy.
WHO has published a number of proteins to test the virus.
The normal method of monitoring is transversation polymerase action (rRT-PCR).
Studies are usually made in the breathing samples found by the beetle; however, the nose tube or the sputum sample can also be used.
The results are usually within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two tests of blood taken within two weeks and the results have little value at the time.
Chinese scientists have been able to distinguish part of the coronavirus and to produce a chain of elements so that the laboratorys around the world can develop for themselves a study of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify the virus with the disease.
Since April 4, 2020, a genetic study of disease (which can detect active bacteria and if a person has already been infected) has been developed, but it has not been widely used.
Chinese findings indicate that accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first medical test on March 21 2020 used at the end of that month. The guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods of identifying the virus based on the medical and risk of control of disease.
Bilarrals multibar grill-glass spread with pherpheral, asymmetric, and polysterirs are common in infection.
Subpléral dominence, grazy spving (lobular hotsopal density with alevenar filling), and codolation may appear as the disease progresses.
Small diamonds are available through microscopic visions and COVID-19 physiology.
Here are some of the basic causes found in surveying:
Macroscopy: plurisy, perciarditis, lung cosolidation, and pulmonary odema
Four types of pneumonia can be observed:
common hormone: pulmonary oedema, pneumaticte hyperpllastia, typical pneucytes, interstitial inflammation lycmation intactation, and mutantantant cell
grave hormone: dioffuse alvelarite (DD) and di mouse alvelar edudaes.
DAD is the cause of acoustic respiestation disorder syndrome (ARDs) and chere hypoxemia.
cooked hormone: a mixture of ididates in alveolar vitisies and pulmonary interstinual fibrosis
Blood: dissimilarized automation (DIC); lénoerythrobaltic reaction
Steps to reduce the risk of infection include staying in the house, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for about 20 seconds, adjusting to oral hygiene and nose and avoiding eye contact, crying or mouth with unsupervised hands.
The CDC encourages closing the mouth and nose when coughing or coughing and encourages the use of the center of the fly if there is no toilet.
A good wash of hands after coughing or sneeze is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of a face mask while in society, in part to reduce the infection from people who do not have the virus. Self - contact techniques are designed to reduce contact with infected people and large groups by closing schools and workplaces, preventing movement and fueling large gatherings.
The guidelines for separation include that people stay apart at least 6 fathoms (1.8 m).
"No known medicine is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since the goal is not expected to be at least 202, the best way to control COVID-19 to try to reduce the number of those who are infected, called "to make the line flat."
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty, before and after meals, and after coughing and wetting.
It also encourages the use of at least 60 percent alcohol - containing handbags, but only if soap and water are not readily available. In places where hand plays are not readily available, WHO provides two ways to produce them.
In these ways, antibial work comes from ethol or ipropanol.
"Hy hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacteria from alcohol; "It is not a killer of hand washing."
Glycerol is inserted to create moisture.
People are treated with care, which may include fluid therapy, health care, and support of other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those who are suspicious of being infected wear a common face mask.
Extracorpole membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to solve the respiratory problem, but its benefits are still considered.
Cleanliness, life, and nutrition have been encouraged to avoid infection.
Physical therapy can help those with non-communicable symptoms that have recently been infected. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published suggestions for caring for hospital patients with COVID-19.
Intensivists and U.S. Polologists combined treatment methods from various channels from free source, IBSC.
Since April 2020, there is no cure for CoVID-19.
When symptoms of disease appear, some doctors promote paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen.
Steps must be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to another person, especially in clinics when procedures are developed that may produce aerosols, such as intubation or handition.
For COVID-19 physicians, the CDC encourages man’s maintenance at the Airborn Inference Information Rome (AIIR) more than using normal measures, preventing contact and detection of the virus. The CDC describes instructions for the use of ersonal protactive technology (PPPPE) during the epidemic.
Requirements needed: PPE scan, faced or face mask, eye protection, and medical glasps. When available, there is encouragement for espiators (in place of the face mask).
N95 respirators are authorized to be used in industry but FDA lets the characters be used under Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
He is not designed to protect air particles like dust, but protection from certain body clocks is not guaranteed in its use.
If not found, the CDC suggests using floats or, if there is no other way, automatic masks.
Most instances of COVID-19 are not so bad that they may need mechanical vintilation or other methods, but some require it.
A form of breathing support for people with respiratory problems associated with CoVID-19 is still being studied by hospital patients, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided by the Chief flag nosal canal cannlula or bi-vel autoitive stress.
Whether these two points lead to the same benefit for the terminally ill.
Some doctors prefer to live with invivive mechanical ecliptics when available because this method reduces the spread of crystals when compared with the basis of the white flash and sal cannula. The worst conditions are common to adults (over 60 years, especially over 80 years).
Most developing countries do not have enough hospital beds, which reduce the number of victims that cause an unexpected rise in the number of people with COVID-19 require hospitalization.
One study in China found 5% being replaced in a place of quadrupled, 2,3% needed to be helped with ventiation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the hospital with COVID-19 ended up in ICU.
Ventilation machines become more complex as an acoustic effect dilates syndrome (ARDS) developed from COVID-19 and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.
The high - level PEP anti-aircientators are needed to increase the availability of oxygen while reducing the risk of lung damage associated with venerators and pneumorosis.
PEP may not be available in oldeventators.
Medical research began in January 2020, and a number of antibiotics were in medical research.
The hangdesvir appears to be the most effective.
Although 2021 is still developing new medicines, several of the tests are already authorized to use some or have already advanced in tests.
Antibiotics can be tried by people with a dangerous virus.
WHO encourages volunteers to take part in the medical research and safety of drugs that can be used to treat them. FDA temporarily endorses the Convalescent plasma as a treatment method studied in cases where a person is exposed to evil.
They do not engage in any medical research needed to prove that they are safe and effective in treating disease.
In February 2020, a young app was developed in China for treating the virus.
Users are required to enter a name and a number of ID.
App is able to see 'if you are close to a person' using a magnetic needle that can be dangerous to infection.
All users can check the condition of three other users.
If the situation appears to be dangerous, the App is not only encouraging isolation, but it also warns health authorities. A great deal of data analysis with a young person’s throwing away from the face, face - to - face technology, phone tracking, and invented knowledge is used to transport infected people to South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the government of Israel granted protection insurances to follow the case of a human cell phone that is thought to have coronavirus.
This is done to keep them separate from the community and to protect those who may have contact with infected residents.
In March 2020, the Deutsche Tecom shared the site of a telephone area with the German government, the Robert Koch Institute, to evaluate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia developed facial awareness technology to locate anti-security laws.
"The Italian public health officer Giulio Galra said to young workers that "40% of the people are still moving."
The German government has pursued a 48 - hour - a - week computer match for 42,000 participants.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a national declaration of solutions to the development of coronavirus.
People may experience the stress of living alone, being restricted to walking, negative side effects of treatment, or fear of being infected by the virus itself.
"BBC quotes Roy O'Connor as saying, "The continued isolation, loneliness, anxiety about health, depression and economic collapse is a storm that affects people’s minds and their well - being."
The virus may have few or no symptoms, comparable to other common respiratory infections like normal cold.
Common cases have been cured within two weeks, while those infected with a bad or critical virus can take from three to six minutes to heal.
Women who are pregnant may be at greater risk of the risk of COVID-19 of the disease - related microbes, such as SARS and MERS, but the disease of COVID-19 is poor. For some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
For those most affected, COVID-19 may soon develop acoustic effect of dilates syndrome (ARDS) and cause damage to the respiratory glands, sepic shock shock or death of many organs.
Problems associated with COVID-19 include sseps, abnormal logting, and heart injury, kidneys and liver.
The clotting anormartis, particularly the increase in prothrobinisms, are found in 6% of those who are hospitalized because of CoVID-19, while kidney failure appears to be 4% of the group.
About 20-30% of persons with COVID-19 show high livers (transinases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, and five are discharged from the hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have about seven days between hospitalization and death.
In the study of early conditions, the average time from the appearance of early symptoms of the disease to the death was 14 days, a total of 6 to 41 days.
In a study of the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate is 2.8% while the rate of women dying is 1.7%.7%.
Bistoptological tests for automation of dead lungs indicate dioffuse alver endage and celgir fibroyxoids in both lungs.
The change of the cytopathic alphabet was seen in the pneumonics.
The lung image showed an acoustic effect of dilates syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart damage was noted for higher levels of stroke or heart shape.
According to the March epidemic from the United States, 89 percent of those who were hospitalized already had disease. The discovery of medical and financial factors and community factors may contribute to the death of people.
The death toll from the virus varies as a result of such differences in provinces, but also because of difficulties in methods used.
A few less adverse circumstances can make the death toll more than expected.
However, the fact that death is the result of the instances of previous HIV cases can mean that the mortality rate is now low.
Smokers have 1.4 opportunities to receive serious symptoms of COVID-19 and are about 2.4 times more likely to receive emergency care or death in comparison with nonsmokers. Concern for long - term previral diseases has been expressed.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has received a 20 - to 30% reduction in the operation of some people who are infected, and the lungs indicate that it may be damaged.
This can also lead to the after - intensive care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was not known that the previous virus could help to provide effective and long - term protection for people recovering from the virus.
The immune system seems to be possible, based on other coronaviruss, but it has been reported in cases where recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by a rapid scan of cornavirus later.
These conditions are thought to be an increase in the virus, not a second - rate infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and from animal sources, and it reaches people.
The exact origin is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the virus was almost entirely directed by the transfer from man to man.
A study of the initial 41st guaranteed conditions of the COVID-19, published in January 2020 in Lancet, showed that the first day of the outbreak of disease was December 1, 2019.
WHO's legal documents reported that early symptoms of the disease occurred on December 8, 2019.
A number of methods are widely used.
These statistics vary from country to country and time and depend on the degree of tests, medical clocks, treatments, time from the initial revolution, and such factors as age, sex, and health.
By the end of 2019, WHO distributed emergency emergency levels of ICD-10, U97.1 killed by a guaranteed SARS-Cov-2 virus, and the U07.2 killed by COVIID-19 were searched by medical practitioners without the confirmed SARS-CV-2 virus. The mortality rate of deaths is indicated by the number of deaths diagnosed during the given period.
According to figures by Johns Hopkins University, the mortality rate worldwide is 6.9% (153,822/2.40,191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies from one region to another. Some methods include the factor factor factor factor (CFR), which shows the percentage of infected people killed by the virus, and infertality rate (IFR), which shows the percentage of infected persons (infR) who are killed by the virus.
These statistics are not based on time and are followed by a number of people from infection to the solution of the situation.
Although not all infected people have a genetic component, the presence of the disease can provide information on how many people are infected.
In an area where most people are infected in Italy, in Castigione d'Adda, a small area of 4600, 80 (1.7%) are already dead.
In Gangelt, the virus was promoted by Carnival gatherings, and it entered the young, leading to low mortality rates, and not all of the victims of COVID-19 were officially recognized as pathogens.
In addition, the German health industry has not yet had great numbers.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have some form of disease, as blood donors have studied.
The 69 (0.04% of the population) were confirmed that they were killed by CoVID-19.
The spread of the disease and the mortality rate vary between men and women.
The number of deaths is higher than men in surveys conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is when they are 50, and the gap between men and women is only close to 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The underlying reasons for this difference are not known, but the genetic and moral aspects of it can be a factor.
The distinction of sexually transmitted germs, the low number of women and men who experience other conditions such as hypertension at younger age than women can contribute to the higher mortality rate.
In Europe, 57 percent of men infected, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were males.
In April 2020, the U.S. government does not follow the sex - related AIDS epidemic.
Studies indicate that increasing diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A high number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have many opportunities for exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the virus would be "COVID-19".
WHO’s prime minister Tedros Adhanno Ghebreyes explained that CO represents corona, VI representing thevirus, D stands for diasse, and 19 for the year marked by the first explosion: December 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen not to be given the name of a specific place (such as China), species of animals or group of people, according to the proposals of various countries in the design intended to prevent discrimination. The virus that causes COVIID-19 is called the vire respatrotry syndrome syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
"WHO also uses "CO" COVID-19" and "A virus that causes COVID-19" in public conversations.
" Both disease and virus are often called "coronavirus"."
"After the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "Coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan."
In January 2020, WHO suggested 2019-nCov and 2019-CV respirotry as names for the virus and disease in accordance with 2015 guidelines against using the names of disease and pathogens.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-Cov-2 are published on February 11, 2020.
Because of the shortage of products in the industry, some manufacturers have sprayed medical materials such as tubes and pieces of fiberherators.
For example, when the Italian hospital urgently needed aventator valve, and the surgeon could send it at the time it was needed, the local company used its equipment and sprayed 100 valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of the COVID-19, imaginary news, false and misleading news arose as to the origin, development, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of disease and spread rapidly to the Internet.
Humans seem capable of transmitting the virus to other animals.
Research has failed to find evidence of the contact of pigs, ducks, and chickens through the virus.
There is no known cure or cure for this disease.
International investigations of the objectives and medicines of COVID-19 are conducted by government agencies, schools, and industrial researchers.
"According to March, the World Health Organization began "De diligent research" to test the effects of four anti-inflammatory drugs that have high hopes of working."
There is no vaccine available, but various injections work to develop vaccines.
The previous work SARS-Cov is used because SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2 both use ACE2 rector to enter the human cells.
Three preventive measures are studied.
First, researchers are planning to develop a vaccine against infection.
The purpose of the use of such germs as this, inactive or dead, is to develop body reactions against the new COVID-19 virus.
The second method, subunit vaccines, aims to establish a goal that enables the immune system to respond to certain features of the virus.
If in SARS-Cov-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme.
The third option is nucleic acid goals (DNA or RNA goals, a new method of setting goals).
The goals examined in any of these ways should be examined for safety and function. On March 16, 2020, the first medical study of this goal began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The goal contains a code of harmless genes that is copied from a disease - causing virus. The improvement based on the genes has been suggested as the challenge of the formation of SARS-COV-2, but this is uncertain.
There are more than 300 medical studies that have continued since April 2020.
Seven studies have been studying the treatment already authorized for malaria, including four hydrogenchloquine, or chloroquine.
Antibiotics make up much of the research in China, and a nine - fold study of the III class in several countries will send a report toward the end of April.
A strong review of the medical establishment of CoVID-19 and alternative drugs has begun, in April 2020. A number of antiviral drugs are studied in the treatment of COVID-19, including Comddevir, chrophyxyloloquine and hypervir and vibrar.
There have been physical evidence of the remdesiver performance, in March 2020.
The progress in treatment of patients has been seen to be seen in the proper use of amdessivir.
A medical study of Article III is conducted in the US, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used in the treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with unauthorized results.
However, the results of research are proposed.
Korean and China Health authorities promote the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although encouraging a single - pound [1 kg] daily dose, notes that twice that amount is too high and can kill.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued permission to use in emergency conditions for hydroxylologone and chloroquine in the sight of doctors who treat patients with COVID-19. Seven Chinese procedures included interferon, riban or vibration in the treatment of COVILD-19.
An unauthorized factor indicates that high doses of libabin are needed in preventing SARS-Cov-2 from in vitro.
A Kaziyxaniide has been suggested in an ongoing study of vio-Cov-2. Research shows that the first rise of the protein primin priming by Trambraone constituency 2 (TMPRSSS2) is crucial to the joining of SARS-CV-2 with ACE2.
The chloroquine study and hydroxyloquine together with azithromycin or without it has large limits that protect the medical community from receiving this treatment without further research. Oseltavir does not prevent SARS-Cov-2 from viro and has an unknown role in the treatment of CoVID-19.
The Cytokin sstorm may be a problem in the later stages of COVID-19 is very bad.
There is evidence that hydroxychloquine may have anti-cytokin syndrome factors. Tolizumab has been added to medical guidelines by China’s National Health Commission after a small study has been completed.
A 2 - grade study is not planned in an Italian national paragraph after showing serious consequences to people with a serious illness.
It is combined with serum fertitin tests to find cytokines, designed to prevent the occurrence of this, which is thought to be the cause of certain deaths.
Interleukin-6 receptor antigogonist was authorized by FDA based on previous research in treating multiple substances, CAR T cells, in 2017.
So far, there is no random, controlled evidence that tocizimab is effective treatment for the CRS.
The transfer of clean and powerful chemical elements produced by the body's immune systems to patients in COVID-19 is considered a way that does not require less protection.
This method was tried with SARS and the results were unknown.
Vilal and utralization is a expected method in which less - than - effective treatment of a disease may result in protection against SARS-Cov-2.
However, other methods, such as enceblár cytotoxicity based on the properties of the disease and/or phagocytos, are possible.
Other therapies, for example, are developed by the use of similar cells.
The production of the Convalescent serum, which contains part of the blood fluid from healthy patients and containing the antibodies related to the virus, can be removed for quick use.
Coronavirus Diseases, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, a doctor in the Central Hospital of Wuhan, who later contracted the virus and died as a result of CoVID-19 after helping to alert the spread of the virus.
