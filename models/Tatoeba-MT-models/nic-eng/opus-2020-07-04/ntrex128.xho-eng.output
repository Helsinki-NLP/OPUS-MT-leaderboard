Members of the Welsh convention (AMs) are afraid to appear foolish
There are the AMs who are concerned because it is raised to change the way they are called MWPs (A member of the Wales Parliament).
This has been highlighted because plans are being made to change the name of the convention into Parliament of Wales.
The AMs in all politics are concerned that this will cause them to sink.
One AM of Labour says that his team is concerned that the new style of the name is closer to how it is called "Twp" and Pwp."
To a student who does not live in Wales: In Welsh hewp he speaks a fool and a pppp.
The AM of the Society of Wales said that the whole organization does not like this, and it has recommended other names.
A member of the Conservative Committee in Wales says that his team has no problem with the change of a name, but they have found that it is not easy to call MWP as a fool.
In this case the form of the letter y is called in Welsh is similar to the way it is called the letteru in English.
The Assembly Commission, which is concerned with creating a policy of changing the name into this new one, said: "The decision of how to call the Convention Members will be adopted by the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave approval for the Welsh convention to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public’s responses and found that the majority supported the change of the convention into what has been called the Palamante of Wales.
In the case of calling AMs, the Commission prefers what is called Members of the Parliament of Wales or the WMPs, but people support the MWP.
II - AMs is said to recommend otherwise, but that it is difficult to agree on this, it must be a problem for Elyn, the Executive Officer, who is expected to lay the law on reform in the weeks to come.
This will include other changes that will be adjusted as the convention is carried out, including the regulations against AMs and the procedures of the committee.
The AMs votes that will end up when discussing this rule in the question of how to be referred.
Macedonians will vote to change their country’s name
The voters will vote on Sunday whether they have changed the name of their country to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
The vote was intended to resolve the dispute over decades with the neighboring Greece of the province of Macedonia.
The Athenians have long argued that the name of their neighbors in the north seems to have an appeal in their area, and they have long disagreed with their application to become members of the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjore Ivanov, opposed the election’s introduction, said that he would not ignore it.
However, the people who support this ruling, including the Federal Zar Zaev, say that this change of name is the price they need to pay to join EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s Handmaiden as the Churches Draw Closer to Harlem
Mr. Adams said: "The old people I talked to said that there was a beer and a church everywhere."
"Today, none of them."
He could see why there was no such thing.
He said: "People are having fun in another way" today.
"Bibri is no longer a living area where people go every day."
He is concerned about the churches because he feels that the money he earned from selling his possessions will not last as long as the leaders think, "if they will soon return to their original situation."
The churches, he said, could be replaced by flagships that would not help preserve the remaining local shrines.
He said: "Many people who buy these flags are white people. So the day will come when the church will be closed, since these special ones do not appear to be members of these churches."
Both of these churches were white congregations before Harlem became a black community, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregation came out in the 1930 ’ s.
The black congregation he served was built up.
St. Martin became a black congregation under the Dead Sea. John Howard Johnson, who led the sales equipment at 125th Street, the main street being purchased at Harlem, opposed to unemployment and lack of support from black people.
In 199 the building was severely damaged by fire, but as the Tet's followers were preparing to rebuild it, it was ordered that the steel be struck.
The sheep. David Johnson, the son and successor of Tat's successor, Johnson in St. Martin's, enthusiastically called the beating of iron as "the bells of the afflicted people."
A skilled metal beater, who had beaten himself, called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and also "a piece of history that will never be replaced."
This artist, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first time in the world that this instrument was played by a black musician, Diosio A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merweather said St. Martin's did not replace another person.
The main thing here in St. Martin's in the past few months has been the queen of the plans for the architects and builders, some of whom have been recruited by church leaders who are not teachers, some of the Presbyterian Church.
The governing body, composed of nonprofit leaders, in July concerned that a criminal would not blame the congregation, although it did not have a role in the use of architects and architects sent by the agency.
Some adherents complain that the tunnels are not to count things.

‘ I’ve got it!'
The lower bone on the chest had all appeared," Hammel said that he had noticed this when he came to the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'" and said Hammel.
The boy is taken by plane to the Rady Children's Hospital at San Diego where he is in a critical situation.
What kind of shark remains to be known.

Sainsbury's plan to bring its products to the UK oil market
Sainsbury's competes with Yubets, Suprugs, and Debenhams for stores with makeup and professional people to help people.
As an important way to get into the UK cooking market that makes up about £2.8bn, which continues to grow while fashion and household goods are falling down, these supersurging mains will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country, and there will be more stores for the next year.
There is an increased demand for fuel products because these items need to use empty shelves after the TV, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's will increase the production of cosmetics with twice as many as 3,000, including such names as Revlon, Essie, Tzezerman and Dr. Paw for the first time.
Those who already have such things as L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt' Bees will have more space to put in places with similar names in stores like Wets.
The package will also inform you of the Boutique repair products so that many will be better prepared for the food - so - called new customers.
On the other hand, the good - naturer Florence Shop will test the requirements of two Sanisbury stores, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, this week, and the second will be opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, a year later.
To buy on the Internet and even now people buy little food every day at a nearby shopping mall, this requires that large stores do more to encourage people to go to them.
Mike Coupe, head of the Sainsbury's chief minister, will look like big stores with a variety of products, as they try to fight stores with stores with such cost as Aldi and Lidl for more services and other food items.
Sainsbury's list of places where you can buy Argos in many stores and started with Havitats because they bought them both two years ago. This increased the purchase of food and the purchase of them for profit.
Efforts to improve the oil - supply and medical facilities have failed.
Her Sainsbury's sister tried to meet the Boots in the early 2000s, but they broke up after fighting on the way to divide the medical incomes in her stores.
This new scheme came into existence after the Sanisbury's trade with Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, its 281 drug-battery package, by £125m, three years ago.
He says Lloyds will also share in this plan, by increasing the high - quality products that include La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial ruler of the Salinbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance of the channels with our makeup to improve our customers.
We have put money in the hands of trained employers so that they can offer suggestions.
Various products are designed to be prepared for each item, making it easy for anyone to find a place where we can find it, and now it is a fascinating field of cosmetics, and it does not look like an old - fashioned method.
Peter Jones's ‘ sound ’ because Holly Willoughby stopped the industry £1111million
Peter Jones, known in the Dragons Den, went away with a “critic ” after the policy driver Holly Willoughby gave up the industry of the production of life - style to face up to his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their production of household products and jewelry like Truly.
This couple’s trade was compared to the Gwyneth Palrow's Goop product.
The pilot of the Third Morning Program, which is 77, put it in Instagram if you are moving.

The sources say that Jones has been "slow" when an important TV girl agrees at a hot Tuesday meeting at his headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshishire, if her new agreements reach £1.5 mlillion - make her not enough time to take care of household products and jewelry such as Truly.
This trade is compared to the Gwyneth Patrow's Goop product and has received twice as much money as Willoughby's estimated in £11 million.
As Willloughby, 377, was putting it into the Instigram if he left Truly, Jones went to one of his vacation homes in Britain.
The source said: "Truly was the most important thing to Holly.
It is expensive because it has been for her for a long time throughout the next decade.
The decision to leave him turned out in fear.
No one who believes what happened on Tuesday is close to the celebration of the celebration.
There is a store full of goods in the Marlow HQ which is ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of a representative of the Third Morning, among those who have the largest profit in Britain, may cost the company millions of millions of dollars because of growing goods from berths and candles to furniture and household goods, and things that can be more enjoyable to its establishment.
And this can mean the end of a long relationship.
The mother of Willloughby and her husband, Dan Baddwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established the Truly with Caps in 2016, and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
These two go to the holiday together and Jones has 40 percent assignments in the Badwin TV station.
Willonoughby will be the director of this M&S dollar and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV program 'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones has said last night "We will not talk about his business affairs."
We spoke “when we loved each other"

Why did President Trump make so many sacrifices?
Trump said with his disturbing voice "This reporter in the news."
"I haven't given up on myself."
He noted that Kim was interested in being reunited after her first meeting in Singapore on June where Trump was introduced as a major nuclear stopover in North Korea.
But the Cold War has ended.
More than three months after the June convention in Singapore, the president of North Korea R Yong Ho told world leaders in the United Nations on Saturday of the Golden Rule that the U.S.
Rather, he said that the United States continues its focus on oppression.
Trump has given hope in his talk at his party.
"We are doing well in North Korea," said.
"We fought with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a lot of contact.
She noted that her efforts to improve Kim’s relationship have produced fine results, which have resulted in the release of captives and the restoration of the bones of American soldiers.
And he has protected them from the strange way he communicates with Kim.
"It is so easy to be presidents, rather than 10,000 outsiders trying to enter this full stadium could have about 200 people standing here," This Trump pointed out to the crowd standing right before him.
Indonesia’s Tasmania and Nikima, destroying the Island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, nongovernmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Even though 10 percent of the Lombok population have been removed from the area, that area has not been declared a disaster zone, which would result in international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in most cases, they make it clear that they are not asking for help from the world, so this is a challenge, ” says Mrsszn Sumbung.
While Save the Children gather to Pau, there is no doubt that foreign workers can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster department, said that Indonesian officials investigate the situation of Plu to see whether the world’s institutions will be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
As a result of an earthquake that regularly reaches Indonesia, this country is often unprepared for an earthquake.
While nuclear shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rare in some beaches.
The lack of a tsunami in Palu, although greatly fortified, may have contributed to the deaths of people.
Even in times of uncertainty, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make travel more difficult.
A hospital ship leaves Lombok to treat victims of an earthquake to Plu, but it will take at least three days before reaching the new site.
President Joko Widuni set the goal of improving the deteriorating foundations of Indonesia when he turned down election support, and he has spent a lot of money in repairing railways and railway trains.
But not getting good support has shaken Mr. So as it will be re-appointed in the next year.
And Mr. Joko is faced with the stress of social struggles in Indonesia, where many Muslim members have entered the most central part of this service.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands have been forced to leave their homes as groups of Christians and Muslims fight on the streets with rubber, knives, and other dangerous weapons.

Bronyell’s last photograph received by a conflict of “remarking history ”
Its removal will be universal justice because of its destruction like that of Tababun in so many native and religious images carried out by his zealous Puritan followers.
But the Tropicll described Mr Crick’s advice "as foolishness" and to try to rewrite history.
] John Goldsmith, chairman of the Tropics Society, said: "It would be inevitable that this discussion is held by the removal of images so that the image of the Oral scan outside the Palace of Westminster becomes a target.
The destruction of images in the English wars was not ordered or done by Cronõll.
Perhaps labor will be paid to him because of the actions of his great - great - grandfather Thomas of the preceding century.
The outstanding way Sir William Hamo Thorneycrof described Crookell is the testimony of 19th - century sentiments and part of the history of many who still think his life should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith tells The Sunday Telegraph: "Cronell is considered by many, probably mostly by the end of the 19th century rather than by now, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, especially in his case the pressure from the empire.
Even this more accurate description is based on ongoing historical debate.
Of course, the controversy that existed during the 17th century has had an effect on the next development of our country, and Cronywell is a person who has set himself up to represent one side of the conflict.
What they accomplish as Lord the Protector must be celebrated and remembered."
A Deadly Robbery Attack on China’s Farms
A farmer has been attacked by an eagle in a market in southern China, according to local news reports.

They will only have to play with them.
They are very self - concerned... they have no purpose of harming them.

The figures have not been present at this moment to be visible to other network, including PSS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And the number of people who saw them in the office is limited.
To put it in this case, it is the same size as the number of followers and when the final ones are watched at the ball games or at the Education Departments.
The Fox of the Nambas, whose view is to have a system that supports the choice of the Kavanaugh, has all the other network by having followers of 5.69 million at the rate of the plague throughout the day, says Niesen.

But Folake says that she will do so only by consulting with the FBI where she will look at charges against the election for the coming week, where the Democrats are a few groups advised.
Fleke suggested that he talk to his relative, The Democratic Guard Chris Coos guard.
After talking with Coons and other satellites after that, Flew made a decision.
Fleke’s choice is powerful, for there is evidence that the Ripauvators do not vote to accept Kavanauh without a investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI to investigate the charges against them.

Dolly Menga’s First Article and the Victory in Livingstone
The expansion of Livingstone would shock the Rangers by passing on to Steven Gerard just twice in 18 games to be made up of the Ibrox night head.

He had many powerful men.
The leader of the crew Halket was with her body, which held the subbly-till, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Worral at each other.
The Ringers needed encouragement.

Trump homes in West Virginia
The President points directly to the situation he selected in the High Court Brett Kabanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the exit of the Republicans to determine the middle time choice.
"Everything we have done can lose in November.
Five weeks are left before history’s most important choice of our time.
This is a big choice, large, and I don't escape it is what I’m running around everywhere to find suitable people," says the report.
Trump continued, "You see the terrible, evil things of the Democratic violent group, and you see them happening right now.
And they are determined to take over the power of authority by using any means that they see as right, unjust, merciless.
They are not concerned about whoever has hurt them, who will go beyond him, to gain power to control and to take over, and, therefore, what they need in power to control them, we will not give them this."
The Democrats, he said, are in machinery on a signal to "to oppose and interfere."
"You have seen what happened these four days ago," stated, calling the Democrats "because they are angry and callous and rude.."
He referred to the Sanate State Committee on the Sen level of Democratis Dianne Feinstein, where he received greetings from onlookers.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you moved a cement?
Oh, yes, what.
Oh, no, I’m waiting for one – it was bad for the body to speak so badly of the body that I didn’t see it.
The Labour is no longer busy.
It is not too late to talk to those who say what they think
While the Momentum's activists in my local group took a vote against me, I was surprised.
After all of this, I am the principal of the Labour series to be informed of the general disparity of their thinking.
My partner, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment that I had received, and he confidently stood up to oppose the Jews.
In my case, the situation of being criticized and opposed was not in harmony with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the important police force of the working economic system, the security of this country, Europe, is in violation of similar issues in which Jeremy disagrees with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labor broadcast that "We want the meetings to include them and have good results."
For almost eight years I have been the 45 Labour in the community, the weekly GGC meetings by Fridays have always been just the same.
Where it is present today, this modern meeting is not a convention in which we usually have "human and soft, bottom" when politics are running out, so they can begin, and not start again.
It seems to be an increasing variety of opinions that are not accepted in the Labour group and all opinion is examined before being accepted into the host group.
This begins after Jeremy entered the seat of leadership, such as a fellow worker and former associate with me, with the idea of sharing a similar view of politics and being expected to change immediately and take places where I would not admit that I would agree with them, even if it was only for protection of the nautical or for any other EU.
Whenever I speak out-and what I don't care to follow the harassment on the pages of the dialogue is said to be taken away from the seat, unless the local politics are accepted, I am told that I am not worthy to be part of the Labour group.
And that is my experience.
Thus, I know that I am better off than my fellow workers as concrete comes directly to me and they like to be political.
I respect the art and the determination of my fellow workers who are coping with sexual or racial harassment every day but who can’t keep it away from them.
One of the most disturbing and political developments in this world is the correct and popular form of persecution.
Jeremy Corbyn described this last week that the Labour class took up a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that it is no longer your largest option and in the form of "a lack of hope" or to change the principles of the group.
I have much advice over the past two years, asking me to give up, not to speak in this way and then "All is good."
But this is not what I will do with politics.
That I joined the Labour in the 32th year as a school child, being influenced by the Tatcher government to ignore the room where I was studying, since I had vowed to fight for the best of public services and for which they were needed, especially if I was the plan or the minister of the government.
I did not hide my involvement with politics, including the previous cleanup.
No one in the East of Nottingham can be confused with any way about where I stand at my police station, and in places where I do not agree with the leaders now.
In these conditions now raised by Hula, I would say, in all I would say that when Brexit incited you to harm you in our homes, business, and public services, I don’t understand his desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Allaur group.
The real thing is that the one message I have is not going to the Nottingham Momentum, whether they belong to my people, whether they are members of the Labour or theirs: I’m proud of working under you, and I promise that no amount of security or political assistance can prevent me from doing what I believe your best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr continues ahead
The two latter elements have led to the final end almost to the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr is worthy of such a good victory for the Tennent's Premiership game.
Now they increase the size, the most divisive factor.
Finally, it was their high - level security, and their opportunity to take a better opportunity, which led to the balance of the home’s case with the trainer Peter Murche.
"We have been tested in our games until now, and we are not beaten up now, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melroshe, says: "To commend Ayr, they do better than we have done."
Grant Anderson in his 14 - minute performance, replaced by Frazier Cmia, has put Ayr before, but, however, the Scotland's Scottish papal card Roy Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowed Meelrose to make special notes and Jason Baggot to take the change.
The U.S. referred to Ayr's leadership by the Penalty, before, during the half of the game, had put an article after she changed the risk to 17-5 to Ayr during rest.
But Melrose has started well half, and Patrick Anderson' dye, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the risk of five points.
It has been said that the damage caused by Ruaradh Knott, which had been removed by the ambush, and when Ayr again started, the Stafford McDowell’s subway, translated by Cmilie.
Ayr’s sticker by Blair Macpherson has been given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose had paid another man with Bruce Colvine’s steady, under intense pressure.
However, back home and when Struan Hutchinson was given a droning card because of putting Cmi without a ball outside the pannalt line, MacPerson went back to sleep as Ayr watched.
Camila has changed, as has almost since the beginning, after Kyle Rowe assembled David Armstrong’s ballpoints and sent the flagellans to the fifth floor.
The Still Game Act appears to be devoted to a new task in the field of deforestation
The Still Game Act seems to be devoted to the reception section after it has been discovered that it has been appointed the director of the license - company retirement company.
A 56 - year - old man plays with Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC exhibition, writing him and another comic expert Greg Hemphill.
The two had already explained that the next ninth phase will be the last to conduct the exhibition and that Kiernan is evidently preparing to do something else after Craigling.
According to traditional records, he is the ruler of the Adriftmon Limed.
The player does not want to comment on this article, although the source of the Scottish Sun has said that Kiernan wants to enter the "Sernan's best-handling business" in Glasgow.
‘ Our sea: Bolivia closed in the world hope that the road will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors reach the port of La Paz.
Public decks blow the blue flag.
Sea-fleets from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have echoed in the words: "Our sea is legally owned.
It is our job to find it again.
Throughout Bolivia’s closed country, the memory of the Chilean coast in the 19th century that had suffered a blood flow in the blood of many of the 19th century is as bright as it is with the desire to go back to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes have been well - founded throughout the centuries, as Bolivia awaits the sentence of a world court on October 1 after five years of debate.
" Bolivia has power, a spirit of unity and calmness, and is waiting for good results," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian politician.
Many Bolivi people will listen to the sentence of the World Law Court in large blocks throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will stand on the Bolivian charges that decades later Chile has been forced to consider giving Bolivia a good land at sea.
Evo Morales, president of Bolivia, whose life - style and legacy is involved in a renewed battle for the next year, has much to do with the Monday sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," confident by the end of the August.
But some social analysts say that it is unlikely that a court case on the side of Bolivia - noto will make such a big change.
The United Nations organization that settles in the Netherlands has the power to take out the land of Chile, and it claims that it does not know the consequences of the possible speech.
The fact that the sentence of the World Law had been issued only six months after the trial was discussed indicates that the case was "free from controversy," says Branch Záraate, a professor of international law.
And instead of supporting Bolivia’s interests, four years may have taken a turn.
"Regulation of sea access has been stolen by the present Bolivian government," said Zárate.
Morales ’ fighting words have ended any kindness on Chile’s part.
Bolivia and Chile will talk another day, but it will be very difficult to hold the conversation after that.
These two countries have not been sending their party to each other since 1945.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velzé, a Bolivian representative of The Hague, ignored the court’s unusual decision.
Monday will give Bolivia "a special opportunity to reveal on a new map to deal with Chile" and the opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of conflict has meted out benefits," says the report.
Calzadilla also undermines the fact that Morales - one of Latin - American best - known presidents also makes use of this phenomenon as a political pool.
" Bolivia will never lose its privilege of being able to reach the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"This sentence is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome what has happened in the past."
North Korea says that it will not abandon nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States
U.S. Secretary of State R. Yong Ho says that his country will never break free from his nuclear weapons if he does not trust Washington.
Ri was referring to Saturday in the United Nations Parliament.
He asked the United States to follow up on promises made during an assembly in Singapore among leaders on the road toward eye control.
He makes this observation when Branch Committee Mike Pompio appears to begin a series of nuclear discussions that had been abandoned more than three months later in Singapore along with Kim Jong Un in North Korea.
Ri says "in the day" that the continued movement and resistance of the United States to end the Korean War will even make the North surrender.
Washington is careful to agree with this agreement before Pyongs take the initiative to break away from the equipment.
Kim and President Donald Trump sought a second conference.
But many doubt that Pyong is willing to give up weapons that the country views as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyong in the coming month to prepare for the Kim and Trump conference.
Paris ’ fashion shows a new variety of recently seen bumps on the streets of a nearby town
If you want to increase the hats you have or you want to block the sun so you don't go somewhere.
Writers Valentino and Thom Browne have begun to form a series of the most unusual synapses of the S19 exhibitions that have fallen alongside the deck placed on the Paris Fainque.
These dramatic hats have swept over the Instagram, and these designers have sent their startling hats to the exhibition.
Valentino’s single - handed hat is a wide wire covering the head of the guard.
Some extremely large hats included razors, nylons, and even pina - but not designed to warm your head.
But Thom Browne brought with it a frightening array of markets right at the time of the Nohepen.
Many of these colorful masks have smooth lips and are much like Hannibal Lucter rather than resistant fashions.
One hat would be to enter the water with a respiratory and a stream while the other resembles a cool ice cylindricum.
And if you like clothes won’t go away, you’ll be fortunate.
Pyramid - looking people say that these masks may also be coming to your neighborhood.
These splendid fittings are on the steps of the "La Bobamba", a two - foot - wide spread of people such as Rianna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The strange bobbulge that filled all the pages of communication has brought a big piece of grass shown on the coast that is nearly as large as a seaman wears your swimming clothes.
A frafififa bag of orange, with the top edges of the fifa with white purple, was going ahead of the Jacquemus collection of La Riviera SS19 in Paris’s Farosian College.
The famous designer Luke Artifig tells FEAMIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags coming to people in the following summer - as the crew will be hard to ignore the people who would have missed these great things.'
John Edward: Language skills that are important to people in the world
Scotland’s private schools have a reputation for academic achievement, and this has continued in 2018 and with other consequences of unregulated tests, which are strengthened individually by individual participation in sports, arts, music, and other public endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), try to present a high level of service to their students and parents.
Private schools endeavor to prepare their students for higher education, education, and social standing.
As an educational section capable of designing and placing the school library suitable, we see the available languages continue as a popular study and a choice requirement at school.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘ If you speak with a person in the language he understands, it reaches his mind.
If he speaks with her in her tongue, she gets her pain."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend on English to cultivate friendships and trust in foreigners.
From recent studies, we can see that languages are high on the table at a high rate of distribution to private schools.
About 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages have received articles in Hingrgrade A.
The data gathered, in 74 SCIS private schools, shows that 72 percent of the students have received Hinger cgree A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students of German, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students have received A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills for children and young people who are truly seeking them in the future.
Now languages, as a preferred study, are equally valued as courses of StEM (scientence, technology, negoriing and mematics) in the library of private schools and others.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Development and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons given by employers for problem meeting hours at work, 17 percent are associated with a lack of linguistic skills.
As a result, more and more language skills are being needed in preparing young people for future assignments.
As more work opportunities require languages, these sins are vital in a united world.
Whatever employment a person may choose, if he learns another language, he will have more opportunity in the future to develop a skill similar to that one.
Being able to communicate directly with people of other countries has opened up many opportunities for someone who knows many languages.
According to You Gov’s experiment with fewer than 4,000 adults of the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak another language well enough for them to communicate and only in French is spoken by more than a half per cent of the sugari, 15 percent.
That is why spending money on developing a language is now important to children today.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those in developing lands, will equip children for the best possible job available.
In Scotland each school has its own unique language.
A number of schools will focus on modern languages that have long existed, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to the UK in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child likes, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in private schools, and there will be also many tutors in this section.
Scotland’s private schools are eager to provide a teaching environment that will equip the children to equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter where they go in the future.
There is no denying now, in the world’s business situation, that languages continue to play an important role in the future of this world, so this must be evident in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "the ability to communicate with the world."
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, separation, and surrender to young people in Scotland.
I hope you get it now.

Trump's West Virginia Ranly Time, in You Tube Channel
President Donald Trump begins his long - standing parties in Wheeling, West Virginia.
The first of the five scheduled sessions of Trump will include a visit to the most popular places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the certificate of confirmation is still established until he chooses to replace the Supreme Court, Trump attempts to reverse the second election because the Republicans are in danger of losing the rule of Congress in November.
When will a Trump convention in West Virginia be held on evenings, and how can you watch the Internet?
The Trump convention of Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the West Virginia convention by means of a cylindricum in You Tube.
Trump is expected to speak at the weekly meeting of the High Court’s High Court General Brett Kavanaugh, in extreme cases because of the charges of misconduct against them, it is estimated that a check will be issued for a week while the FBI is doing research.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans to cope with the November resolution.
As a result, President Trump’s project stated that the five meetings in the coming week are focused on "involvement on volunteers and supporters as the Republicans attempt to protect and increase their numbers in the Parliament and Parliament," the Reuters comments.
"Congres control is so important to him that the president will go to as many countries as possible as we approach the busy dancehouse," the speaker to the Tump ring that we did not want to be known to tell Reuters.
Ordered at Wesbano Arena in Wheeling, this modern night - day drama can extend support from "Ohio and Pansylylvania and is also known in Pittsburgh for its subject," says West Virginia City News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, which the government’s section won by 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia High Commissioner Patrick Morrisey, who goes after this cleansing.
"It is not a good sign for Morisey that the president is forced to deny support," says Simon Header, a professor of evolution at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: An American team shows that if you yearn for success, you will continue to fight as much as you would like to go to one party on Sunday.
After three private sports events, playing as a starting point was the Ryder Cup’s demand.
The position of going ahead in any group has given players the idea of sports that they believe in, and it is in competition like this.
In that sense, who is taking the lead now?
"Request them with six articles and now, in this way I think we are going ahead," says Jordan Spieth as he goes about the same day.
Europe has taken this opportunity, in fact, four points above and also 12 others that have not yet been confirmed.
The Mexicans, as Spieth says, if you feel that it is going well and there are many who would be interested in it, including how Spieth and Justin played all day long and that the couple have three and four points.
Spieth has always played well since the start and paid for it as an example.
When people scream at him for joy while he is playing, he places a ball at a crucial moment after he and Thomas have been hit by two articles.
Playing a ball in a hole that enables them to win a game by 15 has led to similar shouts, telling the American team that they will not be defeated.
"You have to worry about your game completely," says Spieth.
Then they left.
18 holes to identify them.
The scorers on Spieth and Thomas two days ago were Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fleet, a non-condemned report of Ryder Cup
Europe’s ways make it unusual for couples and cannot do anything wrong.
"A couple called "Moliwood" is the largest one who won't hold a bogey on Saturday and Saturday morning, Fridays and Back Nile on Friday morning.
That cooperation, along with their interest, seems good to the crowd as the church’s competitors, and no other famous player can overcome Europe when the sun descends in L Golf National than Fleetwood and Mololleyri.
They are better to play together at the same time in different places.
To speak of European success has not yet been seen, however,
Bob Watson and Webb Simpson did the work of Sergio Garcia was small, a professional of four footballs in the morning, when he found cooperation with Alex Noren.
The Bogey and the two - leaved fonts and the Spanish hole and the Virgin were unable to escape.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you to get out of that hole.
Four footballs and four players are happy to watch them close because of the cooperative community, the advice they offer, the advice they don’t take, and how the program can change within brief periods.
Europe has been playing better as a team up to the present time and leads to the last day but four players have shown that this American team has pursued an unbelievable success, especially the Stateside.
Europe leads 10-6 last day in the Ryder Cup
Europe will take the best lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup after four articles and four sports events that have made them pay in 10-6 Americans.
It is interesting that two Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary changed the game to defeat suffering Tiger Woods to make progress in Le Golf National by four points.
The European case of Thomas Bjorn, wanting to win the boom that defeated them in Hazeltine two years ago, defeats the American U.S. case by four points, winning a series of games in 31.
The United States did not readily agree on four games, winning two games, even though they had not been able to finish the debt.
Jim Furyk’s case requires eight articles in 12 private sports to obtain this license
Fleetwood was the first European to wear four points that were new while at the same time with Mololmilieri, called "Molliwood" after the last week on the first two notes to win four points when the Ryder Cup opened.
When they hit Woods and Patrick Reed in four footballs, they passed their victory over Woodsn and the American railways Brysin Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, attracted to two Saturdays, showed interest but divided 19 out of 29 games he played in four footballs and four players and seven others in a row.
Justin Rose retired early in the morning of the hourbals and returned with his assistant Henrik Stenson to Foursome in 21 as well as between Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - leading world leader
Europe was not easy in France.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who was a champion of three, did a beautiful thing for the Americans to receive two articles on Saturday.
They got a victory by 2 to 1 when they played with Spanish Jon Rahm and the Ian Polarter of the fals and then divided Polars and Roy McIlroy in 4 and 3 of the folders across the two opening holes.
Just twice in the Ryder Cup group from the division of four points to individual sports, although Furyk’s side needs to play in the hands of each other to get a match.
After two days, the attack on the Church was to protect them.
North Korea says that it will ‘ never complete its equipment before it gets safe.
The director of foreign facilities in North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that these judgments caused tension between the United States and there was no way that the Americans could complete their Nuclear equipment if they received security assurances.
Ring Ho has told the board to take positive steps last year, such as to stop the testing of weapons and the disposal of the Nuclear facilities, and to make a promise that we would never again make Nuclear weapons.
"No matter what, we don't see similar steps from America," says.
"Unless there is no promise from America, there will be no hope for the security of our country, and in this case we will never break our weapons without talking to America."
While Ri reconvinced what was commonly called North Korea’s refusal to complete Nuclear armaments in terms of what North Korea has been given as a reward for the small steps it took, his report did not deny what Pyong had been done to finish the damage.
Ri told of a combined report by Kim Jung Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the president of the United States and the governor of North Korea that was held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work "to complete the Nuclear equipment in the Korean area" while Trump promises the security of Korea.
North Korea wanted to end the Korean war of 1950-53 in justice, but the American said Pyonyang should put an end to the Nuclear weapons first.
Wahington’s appeals for reducing the international adverse judgment facing North Korea are rare.
"America is forcing "to complete the completion of Nuclear armaments first" and increases the pressure level with sentences to fulfill their purpose in a forced way, against the proclamations of the end of the war," says R.
"The idea that judgments can frighten us is a myth of people who don’t know about us.
But the problem is that these judgments increase distrust.
Ri did not discuss the plans of another Kim conference and Trump, which the president of America spoke before the United Nations this week.
Instead the officer spoke of three meetings between Kim and the governor of the south and Korea Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the group is in this situation to pass the Nuclear armaments of South Korea and not America, then would it be to finish Nuclear instead of Korea."
Nevertheless, Ri’s speech is different from the previous year, when speaking to the general U.N. conference, which said that the attention of North Korea's flying weapons in the American country was inevitable after "UMn. Evil President ” Trump called Kim "man of the Fleets" ready to kill.
In this year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to ‘ utterly destroy ’ North Korea, has given Kim thanks with courage for taking steps to eliminate weapons, but says that there is much more work to do and the penalties will remain far away from North Korea to complete Nuclear.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he has no set time for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say that the U.N. Security Council should pay Pyong to the steps he took.
Nevertheless, American secretary - general Mike Pompeii told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "Violence of the Security Council should continue to continue actively until we see the complete and sure completion of the Nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has reported cases in agreement in North Korea since 2006 for the end of Pyoyang Nuclear military systems.
The Pompio met with R over the U.N. General Assembly and said he would visit Pyyang again to prepare for the second conference.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyonyang in July to say that there was a goal to be made, but North Korea was independent of doing the same for the robbers.
North Korea offered to meet Maon this month so that they could break down the Nuclear missiles if the American "complemented action."
Kim told her that the "company actions" she needed the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and the progress in normal relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard learned how to get sufficient rest
A new study at Harvard University this year allows all unloaded students to sleep well enough to fight the custom of reading all night by using caffeine.
One authority has found that students at the university are less aware of the benefits of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, chief of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's hospital, held this study, believing that it was the first of these in America.
He was encouraged by his talk about the consequences of failing enough sleep at the meetings.
'When we finished one class of the study one girl came up to me and said: ‘ Why am I told this now, am I going to finish school?'
He said to me that no one had told him the importance of going to bed, which surprised me, ’ he told The Telegraph.
This study started this year, explaining the benefits of sleep on education and sports, as well as improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and the university’s senior director of medical services, said that the university had decided to bring the course after finding more than enough sleep students.
This one - hour course involved a series of delightful activities.
In one section there is a picture of a university bedroom, where students are clicking coffee cups, curtains, training clothes and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects the development of sports.
In one section, participants are told how lack of sleep increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The school map, with its attractive qualities, encourages the participants to think about their daily routine.
‘ We know that we will never change the conduct of the students immediately.
Even so, we believe they have the right to know — as you have the right to know the health consequences of smoking rats, ” says educator Czeisler.
The culture of insomnia continues to exist, saying, adding that modern technology and pressures in students are a growing problem
To make sure that he has sufficient sleep should be a secret weapon to cope with stress, fatigue, and anxiety, even to avoid obesity, as sleep disorders tend to overwhelm the mind, making it more and more hungry.
Raymond So, 19, a 19 - year - old from California who studies chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler to study the class after his first year in Harvard.
He said that he had open his eyes to the class and had been interested in making it available to the whole school.
He hopes that the next step is to invite the trained students to make the same study program before entering the contest.
Dr. Czeisler suggested that students think that they have an alarm clock, with a wake, and that they are alert to the harmful effects of electrical lights and LED light, which can interfere with everyday routine activities, which can lead to sleep problems.
The Livingston 1-0 Ringers Menanga of the Grarards in one article
The Ringgers also encountered a problem when playing while Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerad with the same article on the horizon (1-0) in Livingstone.
The side of the Ibros had a desire to draw back to the first time the St Johnstone was hit by February 41. But the Gary Holt hit Gerard for the second time in the 18st play, which he began to be overloaded as he lost eight points except for the running front team in the Landbrokes Premierships.
Minga received an article in the moment ahead of the half-time and the Ringgers were not interested.
While the Rangers came to the sixth position, Livingstone rose to the third after it by the Hibernian.
And there are problems that still come to the Ranggers after the Langersman Cum Spence has been intended for head injury after being struck by a missing object from the side of the game.
Gerard changed the athletic periods to go with Ayr in the play before the latter of Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt continues with 11 Livingstone alike who took one point from Herets a week ago and rejoiced in the way his team beat its opponents in all manner.
The Ringgers have controlled the game, but Livingstone has done more when he finds a ball.
It should be a second time when the Menga player allows Scott Pittman to go to the branches of Allan McGregor but the middle player didn't find it.
Kegoan Jacobs threw away the ball found by Craig Halket, but his companion, Alan Lithgow, was able to open more doors on the rear steps.
The Ranggers did not get control but seemed more optimistic than beliefs about the third match before the last one.
Alredo Morelos feels that he should get a pencil in a half hour sign as he and Steve Lawlesss clashed but the poet Steve Thomson did not take over the cry of the Colombian game.
The Rangers had opportunity to throw a ball near the platform before the first stage of the game, but Abram Kelly didn't find a problem with a football mounted on Lasna Coulibaly's head and with Ovie Nigeria.
While Livingstone received the first article in 34 minutes that has been hard to find, no one can deny that it is truly worthy of them without any effort at all.
Ringgers also failed to prevent a ball stolen by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not act like Declan Gallagher who passed a ball to Scott Robinson, who was not concerned about achieving Menga.
Gerard made changes at first as he changed Colulbaly and then introduced the change to Ryan Kent’s offer immediately as the player opened up to Morelos, but the best player ever fled for him.
But Livingstone has continued to make the team to play what he wants, and Lithgow and Halket are also playing the ball too far away.
The Holt team would get an article at the start of the game, but McGregor stood firm and resisted Jacobs before Lithgow put it on the stairs on his head.
Another Rangers performer, who was recently introduced by Glenn Middleton, had another charge of punishment as he met with Jacobbs but had also failed to take the lead in Thomson.
Almanac: Geiger Couter
And now the page from "Sumday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, more than 136 years ago today, and SAPA... date by scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, which was developed by the development of a device known as the Geiger Cointer.
It has been used since then, the Geiger Cointer has also been used in the pop culture as well, as shown in the 1950 film "Bells of Conndao," which has the most intriguing characters are scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "Geiger Cointer, used to search for precious stones.
When you put these things into your ears, you will hear the effects of Atoms released by the radiation.
Evans: "Speak, it's just now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days after his birthday of 663.
But this eye with his name will keep on going.

The method of doing so involves releasing the body cells from the patient, converting them to laboratoryary de "see" common cancer proteins called HER2, and repopulating them to the body again.
University professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute located in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have an effective vaccine."
HAR2 "gives the growth of various cancers." including breast cancer, ovarian, respiratory and hysterectomy, explains a university teacher Berzofsky.
The same method of exterminating the organs of the patient and the "to educate them" to study cancer cells has worked in the treatment of leukemia.
Kane West Watches Trump’s Support in Talk, Carrying the MAX, After the SNL.
It Did Not Go Well
Kane West received no support during the Saturday Light Live after a series bringing praise to American President Donald Trump and said that he would enter the election in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, the Grand Town sang with his personal copy of the Maya Great, and he gave a lecture against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"Many times when I’m talking to a white person when they say, "How can you love Trump? You are a racist"
And I say that if I had been concerned about race, I would have gone away long ago, ” he said.
The SNL started its program with a video showing Matt Damon that laughs with Brett Kananaugh before the Committee of the Arts Committee on Sexual Harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Though not widely distributed, the West video has been posted in a chat room by the critic Chris Rock.
It is not clear that Rock was trying to make West laughs at this video.
Then, too, West provoked the anger of onlookers by confronting him with difficulty before he entered his seat.
"They have abused me behind me.
And they said unto me, Thou shalt not enter therein also into this watch, which thou hast borne.
They had abused me!
And they said I was in the truth, ” says Washington Examiner.
West adds: "Do you want to see a lost space?" saying that you will wear "superman uniform, because it means what I want to do. Do you want the world to continue?
Try to show love.
His speech received no support from the SNL observers and staff, says Variety, and someone else saying: "All of us are silent."
West has been replaced by Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend died, rapper Mac Miller a few days ago.
West has popularized the song I Love It, dressed like Perrier Botle.
West receives support from the head of the TUSA group, who wrote to Twitter: "I am speaking to the most courageous person: I AM ESSE OF THE GREE.."
And the organizer of the system, Karen Hunter, writes to Twitter that just West is "the kind of person he really is and is a wonderful thing."
"But I have made the decision not to reward someone (by buying his music or giving support to her "in her skill") that I believe she has accepted and conveyed harmful ideas to my society.
You are free.
So it is with us, ” he added.
Prior to the program, this rap composer informed his followers to Littleter that he had changed his name to justice, saying that he is known as "As West by justice now."
He is not the first musician to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rap partner, Snow Dogg has changed his name to Snow Lion and the lateist singer who was credited with the Prince who changed his name to sign.

He added: ‘ What is taught?
What is taught on television, on the streets, and on the streets, to make boys think that it is impossible for them to become males?

HIV/Aids: China reported increase by 14% of new cases
China reported a rise in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS by 14%.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, the medical authorities say.
An estimated 40,000 infected persons were infected in the first quarter of 2018 alone.
More often than not, people are infected with the disease through sexual intercourse.
Normally, many people in China are affected by blood transfusions.
But the number of people affected in this way was reduced to total destruction, and the medical authorities in China went so far as to attend a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a real problem for the GBT population in China.
Homosexuality is no longer common in China since 1997, but discrimination against the GGT people is said to be difficult.
Since this country has such an uneasy outlook, research has revealed that men who sleep with 70-90% of men are going to marry people.
The most often affected is created without adequate protection from sexual relations.
Since 2003, Chinese government has promised access to HIV treatment as part of the problem.
Maxine Waters described the information about the identity of the identity of the DOP channel, which has been issued by the public, there has been a “declaration of difficulty. ”
American representative Maxine Waters Saturdays denounced the claims that one of his employees included personal details of the American Republican network in Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democratic states that the charges against them are echoed by the experts and their associates.
"Absities, lies and a lot of lies," says Waters in a report in the Fleet.
According to reports published home addresses and phone numbers of these American participants. Lindsey Graham of Southern and Carmia, and Mike Lee include Orrin Hastch, Utah.
These details appear on the Internet on Thursday, inserted by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during the synod’s speech about the impeccable behavior and the lack of justice on the part of the Supreme Court Justice Brett Kabanaugh.
These details have been published after a period of time by the friends who have asked Kawanaugh about questions.
The Web sites such as the Gateway Fund and the RedS State reported that IP indexs indicated that the source of toxicity from the Waters office even produced details of the Waters employment, says The Hill.
"These without arguments are completely false," adds Waters.
"A member of my employers is at risk because their personal details have been removed because of these false accusations that are not available - responsible for the removal of the articles.
This without basis is a lie.
Waters ’ report finds immediate criticism on the Internet, including the former secretary of the American president, Ari Fleischer.
"This is worse than sound," wrote Fleischer
"This indicates that he does not have the degree to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is falsely accused of something he has not done, he is not obligated to act in a provoked manner.
He does not have to fight.
He does not have to consult a prosecutor’s motives.
It has to be calm and cool."
Fleischer’s answer to Waters and Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being too angry of the Fourth influenza.
Omar Navarro, the Republical quarters' election during the year, has also expressed his opinion to the Tourter.
"Mater matters if this is true," she wrote to the Tourter.
In his noise, Waters said his office to inform the "comparative authorities and the courts of the law about false charges.
We will make sure that the suspects are exposed," he added, "and they will pay legally for their risky activities to my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Ain - Loned pipe decomposition of Rowan Atkissonos
It is common for days to look at things about Brexit when watching an English - related movie and similar to the scene of the old excited film Johnny English - from 2003 to return in 2010.
Will this attractive film reflect the fact that we are unable to sell abroad?
This blue - faced man named Johnny English finds his license to reawaken his name as a substitute for non - English observers.
It is indeed the most prestigious and honest of the Government as well as the little that Clouseau, and the Mr. Bean. Bean and at least one of the boys singing the same song in the Chaiots of Fire at the London Olympic in 2012.
He is even a stranger and a man of secret known worldwide at Atkinson, who has been a model of the Barclayard’s television ads, which leave the conflict with which he goes.
There is one or two sounds in this video show JE.
I like it when Johnny English comes to helicopters in front of the safety clothing while the helicopter hits his heel.
Atkinson’s freey gift is interesting, but it is not so powerful when compared with such heavy products as 007 and the Mission Sp spring which include the latest comics.
These jokes may be considered to be directed to children and not to adults, when I speak of Johnny English’s ridicule does not reflect a little skill compared with the Atkinson soccer film while playing on Bean
The news in this film is that English is in serious trouble
The Internet surer had wrongly entered the tanker, saw the details of all English truckings working, until the worker was surprised — the very little part of Kevin Eldon’s work.
The news passes through the proud high - ranking officer, who is faced with the problem of incompetence such as politics: Emma Thompson tries to do what is right as she plays Teresa May, but the writer of the film’s film doesn’t do well when writing it
The wise counselors tell him that like all truckers, they have to get back into a retireing life.
And that is what the monk Johnny English himself, who has received the position of a high school principal, but who presents the wrong course of being a stranger, while English teaches strange ways as to how to be a trucker rather than in real times.
English is returned to Whitehal and told of this emergency to meet his former companion Bough, also played by Ben Miller.
Bough is a married man, married to the captain of the submarine.
This couple with experience in transportation goes back to work, and they meet Ophelia Bulettova, who is fed by Olga Kurylenko
During this time, the superior official believes a million - dollar technological - rich man that we can solve the problems of the English computer: the wicked man Jason Volts, played by Jake Lacy
English and Bough began the divisions: offering food donors, burning the French dining bar; they set up problems when aboard the Volta treasure liner; and English brings an attack when they try to use the stuff placed on the top of the Virtual Realty for learning within the Volta's house.
Everything has been done in the last section, though interesting and enjoyable, with the television programs of children talking about all of this.
Common things.
Like all other displays of Johnny English, I wonder if the English industry could not give Rowan Atkinson an appropriate role in his skill?
A team of employees deny that they arrange Britain’s citizens for four days to work but five days to be baptized
Jeremy Corbyn’s team arranged for employees to work four days a week, but they were paid five days ’ wages.
It is reported that the team needs company managers to hire employees for a profit when companies work for an Artiificial Intelligence (AI) day.
The change will mean having three - day, but the same reward awaits the workers.
The sources say that this plan is “well fitted with the economic ideas of the group and the policy of the exchange of the country to take over the role of the employees.
Turning in a four - day week has given the approval of the Trades Union Congress as a way for employees to take part in economic change.
The top source of Labour Patty told the Sunday Times: ‘ The testing of systems is expected to be announced before a year goes by.
‘ It will never happen immediately, but the four - day working week is the ideal idea for this new economic group to be on the side of the staff and the business schedule of the party.'
A team of projects was not the first to provide support for a similar opinion, and Green Party made a four - day plan while abandoning the election of 2017.
This program presently does not receive full support from the Labour Party, however.
A spokesman for the Department for the Service Department said: ‘ The week of four days of work is not a group and is not an observation.
Relief officer John McDonnell has used a previous job conference to explain his view of the economic change that helps people.
Mr. McDonnell says that he is willing to take the power of ‘ the rulers who do not want to be seen by anyone' and who are ‘ profiting ’ from the big business.
The provision of this assistant officer means that water-handling operators do not receive their assignment as the service government may pay ‘ fines ’ that they do not do well.
He confirmed his plan to install employees in business positions and to make a banking purse involving everyone in order to give the employees 10 percent of nongovernmental businesses as much as £500
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" that the FBI can change the idea.
A DBBI investigation of accusations placed by the judge Brett Kananaugh has made the last time of his arrest to the Supreme Court every week, and it raises the question that the results of the research on the institution may change the content of the Republicans to change their mind with the support they give.
In an interview on Sunday, the reporter for "60 Minutes" asks the Czech journalist John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could have a mental impact.
Kennedy has found it easier to speak to her than to her sister from South Carolina.
"Yes" to Kennedy
"I’m going to get into the mud, and I’ll talk to the judge Kabanaugh."
I called him after this, after the charges had been removed, and I said, ‘ Did you do?'
He was calm, confident, not afraid. ”
However, it seems that Graham’s contract did not change.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and will be forced to take a heavy stroke," he said.
Gqirh. For, I don't know what happened, but this is what I know: Brett has denied these powers," adds Graham, addressing Chris Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who talks about him can confirm these charges.
36 years
I don't see any changes.

To get a ticket to go to a party (unless you are willing to register a VIP ticket), you must do a volunteer project such as writing an e - mail, calling, or even any other meaningful means to inform others of their purpose to end poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen since he was 12 years old been in fulfilling his purpose?

Since 2011, the Global Citizen has reported that it has reported 19 million acts on its supporters, facing different objectives.
These acts have been helpful in encouraging the world’s taxpayers to make records of commitments and of more than $37 billion of money that will be responsible for the lives of more than 2.25 million people by 2030.
As early as 2018, this group described the 103 commitments and reports for their actions, $10 billion.
The commission claims that the income has helped some 649 million people around the world.
Some of these commitments include The Power of Nutrition, which is a joint practice for U.K's financial and human activities "to help children grow up to the extent to which they should go," the institution promises to provide Rwanda $35 million to help complete malnutrition in the country after they have received the 4,700 messages from the Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments of different countries and the Global Citizen similar to you, we may even be able to eliminate the injustice of malnutrition," says the representative of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, reporting the party in London in April 2018.
This group has after some 5,000 actions asking the U.K to improve proper nutrition for mothers and children, the government has issued funds to deal with the problem, with The Power of Nutrition, which would help mothers and five million children to provide food.
When they answer one of the most common questions asked on the Internet, "What makes you think we can end up in a crisis?"
The Global Citizen said: "A long and difficult course will sometimes fall and fall.
But as a change of human rights and the urge to fight the discriminatory process before us, we will succeed, for we are powerful when we are others.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and others who will enjoy this year’s party in New York, will be welcomed by Deborra-Le Furnesss and Hugh Jackman.
America can use a water bottle to prevent Russia from removing energy sources from the U.S.
America can find safety under the navy to prevent Russia from selling electrical power, including the Middle East, explains the U.S. Internal Secretary, Ryan Zin, as reported in Washington Examiner.
All of them accused Russia of having a responsibility in Syria - where the government’s legitimate function was organized to explore new electrical systems.
"I believe that their purpose in the Middle East is because they want to sell other countries as Europe has done in Eastern Europe, in the European organ of South Europe," says.
And, according to the officers, there are ways and powers of dealing with them.
"America has the power, by the navy, to make sure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure that their power does not travel to the market," he says.
All of them were speaking to the audience on an occasion adopted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group of nonprofits who call themselves "in the voice of power operators" in the United States.
He then compared the American approach to Russia and Iran, saying that they have not changed.
"The choice of economics in Iran and Russia, virtually, to raise costs and obtain other oil substitutes," says, when he calls Russia with a drum capable of producing a single reliable power made by natural elements.
This report appears after Trump’s government made efforts to promote the export of water - producing European gas power, replacing Russia, with no higher value in European countries.
As a result, the authorities of Trump government, including the American president Donald Trump, tried to stop Germany from supporting the work "without justice" of the Nord Strong 2, according to Trump work, has done Russia’s“ prisoner. ”
Russia has also said that this World Stream 2 pays $11 billion, will double the present amount if it is 110 billion meteors, a good job beyond the economy.
Russia says that American opposition to this work has economic reasons and is an example of poor competition.
"I believe that the power should not be a force of oppression, and the consumer must be able to select the merchants," says Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak after the meeting with American Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow by Seplo.
The American position in this situation was not well received in Germany that strengthened the commitment of the project.
A leading firm in the business, the German Government Center (BDI), requested that the Americans go away from the EU systems of power and contracts about Germany and Russia.
"I have a big problem when the third country is pressuring our power." So says Dieter Kempf, head of the German Business Center (BI) after a meeting with the German manager Angela Merrket and Russian president Vladimir Putin.

The Massachusetts journalist Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday "You will consider the choice of the president after a half-term election.
At the city hall in Hoyoke, Warren of Massachusetts, is confident that he will enter the election.
"It is now time for the assembled people to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes having someone in a high position," says The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider it difficult to enter the election of president."
Warren is cynical about president Donald Trump in the city hall, calling his father ‘ this country’s wrong way.
"I’m more concerned than what Donald Trump will do in our freedoms," he says.
Warren is well - known for his criticism of Trump and his assistant to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Writing to Twitter on Friday, Warren said, "We need a FBI investigation before we vote."
Nevertheless, the votes released on Thursday, however, show that many of Warren’s followers feel that it is not a good idea to enter elections in 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of the people are "thought" if the Massachusetts voters said that the party should not enter the election, according to votes from the Suffolk Political Research Center / Boston Globe Polll.
Thirty - two gave support to this idea.
These votes have shown much support to the former printer Dival Patrick, 38 percent supporting the election.

An American country representative accuses China of ‘ exploiting ’ using ‘ false advertising ’
A week later, an official Chinese newspaper made a four - page advertising in an American newspaper about American and China’s commercial interests, an American representative accusing the country by using American media to spread lies.
American president Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke of a Chinese Daily advertisements in the Iowa - newspaper of Iowa - where he accused China of its plan to interfere with the purity of November 6, which is the charge of China.
Trump’s accusation that China is trying to interfere with election is what American authorities tell Reuters that a new section of the development project for America to put pressure on China.
Even if governments in various countries are accustomed to offer advertisements to promote trade, China and America are now competing in trade and putting more costs.
China adds prices to the economic crisis and is designed to affect foreign suppliers in government policies such as Iowa, who support the Trump of the Republican team, say Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American representative of China and an old governor of Iowa, sold to China a large portion of the food produced, said, China has damaged American employees, farmers and businesses.
China, Bradad writes his opinion in Des Moines Register, "he is now ready to exploit us by putting false advertisements in our newspaper."
"As they spread false information, the Chinese government puts it at risk to hear America using its traditional custom of freely speaking and having free information and advertising in Des Moines Register," writes Bradad.
"In contrast, instead of news here in Beijing when you drop the station, you will get a few different opinions and never see how the Chinese really think about the economic development of China, we assume that he is under the influence of the Chinese communist group," he writes.
He added that "one of the most common newspapers has denied his request for publishing the matter" to which the newspaper does not say.
Republicans drive a crowd before the election of the peninsula against Kavanaugh’s problem, warning the investigators
Like the high - ranking Republicans standing next to the prisoner of the Supreme Court, Brett Kananaugh and protected him from his slanders, sexual abuse, researchers say they will see bad breaths, especially to the crowded people, this coming white for the first half.
Feelings about this situation have passed, and Republicans have repeatedly said that they want to continue the election.
You cannot reverse these things," says Grant Reeher, a university professor of psychology at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, telling The Hill when an article published on Saturday.
Reeher says you may doubt that the last time efforts of the chart Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to begin a FBI investigation if they can change the opinion of angry voters.
"People in crisis will not immediately forget what tomorrow’s happened to tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and public spokesman for the movement leading up to Move On on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters would say again, "You come, November!" walking on the satellite corridor as the Republicans ruled the Justice Committee and decided to continue Kabanaugh’s arrest despite doctor’s testimony to Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford, says Mic.
"Love for freedom and enthusiasm will be many," says Stu Rothenberg, a neutral lawyer, informing the news agency.
"People have started saying that you're up right now, this is true
But there may be more, especially for people who have not yet made a decision as to whom they will vote with younger votes, 18-29, who, although not favoring the president but not accustomed to vote.
Even before Ford’s public testimony to the accusations he has against the arrest of the High Court of Sexual Abuse, researchers say that there can be negative results when the Republics require a guarantee.
"This has turned into a problem with NBC News," says Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republic National Committee for the previous week.
"It isn't important for the committee or the last party or if Kavanaugh is in the court, about how the Republics deal with this situation and whether they treat him," points to Guy Cecil in this press center, the ruler of the Puritans USA, a group that helps to select the Democrats.
Even so, the camels seem to have no idea who they believe between the evidence of Ford and the Kavanaugh, although there are a few who take the latter side.
The 411 percent who participated in one survey have shown that they either believe or fully believe Ford’s evidence, while 35 percent have shown that it is possible to believe in or believe in the full conviction of the Abanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of those who thought that Kavanaugh would be likely to be a liar are convinced that when he gives a witness, only 30 percent at the same time say the same thing about Ford.
After taking an interest in Fleke, the FBI investigates accusations made by Ford and another witch, Deborah Ramires, says The Guardian.
Ford has submitted evidence before a court of justice the previous week that Kavanaugh abused him on 18 sexual abuse while having drunk Kavunugh
Ramirez accuses that the prisoner of the Supreme Court introduced his private parts to him while they were in class at Yale in the 1980 ’ s.

Bernard Vann: Victoria priest with WW1
The first and last church to obtain Victoria Cross during the world War.
President Bernard Vann won the prize in 29 Seplo while at Ballentli and Lehauccourt in 1818.
Even so, he was put to death by a firing squad whose only one died in four days, not knowing that he would have the highest prize in Britain.

According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, L. Col. Vann paid men under him to pass the Canal de Saint-Quentin "with heavy fog and heavy guns and machine guns."
Later he fled to the shooting range and bravely seized the major guns and machine guns.
Lt Col Vann was killed by Germany with a gun - wielding cat that shot far in October 4, 1918 - over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says that his grandfather’s actions are “the thing he knows he is never able to do, but he said it is humble."
He and his brother Dr James Vann established a history that was made a circle after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Bank.
Michael Vann says that he feels "bucked as he has experienced the crisis of youth" and adds that "the courage of the champion of the truth will be shown by the people who offer much support."
MMA supporters did not sleep to see Bellator 206, but received only Peppa Pig
Now, don’t go to sleep because you want to watch Bellaor 206 just to meet and not play.

By 6: 00 a.m., at the time of the confrontation, Gengard Moususasi and Jerry MacDonald, observers at UK were surprised when they saw a change in Petera Pig.
Others are as disappointed who have spent the night all night to see the war.
One pursuer describes this change in animation as a bad comic
"The policy of government that from six in the morning the system was no longer appropriate because they must change what is not seen and the children's, "That is what the vice president of the advertising and communications organization, when asked about what happened.
"Heppa the pig," yes.
The president of Bellor, Scott Coker, said that they would change their times next so that the UK viewers would watch.
When I think of playing it again, I think it is possible, ” says Coker,
"The problem if the time is six o’clock on Sunday for them will not be able to do this until Sunday for them.
But it comes with a schedule.
I believe, when it changes over the course of the course, many stores have entered and all were not very pleasant.
We tried to correct it, thinking that our employer’s problem was our problem.
But otherwise, it was a State problem.
I promise you that we will never see it again.
We are going to put five wars to less than ax - like and try to bring far more of what they expected but said that we did more.

Desert Island Disc: Tom Dley feels “little ” because of his sexual behavior
The Olympic apologist Tom Dley says he is growing up smaller because of his sexual appearance, but it gives him the desire to succeed.
This 24 - year - old says I’m going to the second school if I’m not like other people."
Concerning the first program of the Desert Island Disscs, conducted by Lauren Loverne in Radio, she says that she spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give them "hope."
She said that being a parent paid her back so that she could no longer care for the Olympics.
The usual director of the program, Kirsten Young, has read months of illness.
Upon appearing like a man abandoned in Laverne’s first garden, Daisy says that she felt the younger she felt as she grew up because "it was not allowed to love boys and girls."
She said: "Even to this day, the feeling of discomfort and being different is what has given me the greatest satisfaction and strength to succeed."
She wanted to present herself as "something," saying, so that no one would be disappointed by her sexual appearance.
This winner who won the double nuclear bomb of the Olympic has been a public match with the GBT and has used his fame this year in the Commonwealth Games of Australia to ask more countries to make the investigations for justice.
She said that she spoke because she felt good about being able to live without having to deal with problems and wanted to give others ‘ hope. ’
This world winner said that he had a relationship with the American movie producer in 2013 - "You didn’t expect it. ”
Darley is married to the Oscarist, who is 20 years older than she was last year but says that the distance between them was not a problem.
"When you face such things as a youth" - go to his first Olympic at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was difficult to find a person of the same age who faced the same problems of life.
This couple became parents in June, they found the son whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Stanley says "All his ideas" had changed.
"If you would ask me last year, I would tell you that I need to ‘ find a gold ring, ’ he said.
"You know, there are great things to finish the Galipicades.
My gondola's gondola Robbie."
Her son has a name similar to that of his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after a stroke.
He said that his father would not accept his death and that one of his last comments would be yes.
"I didn't know that you will not be in the front position", he said.
"I held him by the hand when he finished breathing and saw that after he no longer breathing, he could not live forever," he said.
The following year Dley competed in 2012 Olympics and got the copper wheel.
"I soon realized that this was what I had always dreamed of — throwing water into the water before the crowds in the Olympics, I didn’t feel better, ” she says.
It also impressed her that her first song, Proud, composed by Heather Small - ever - jovial characters, was so exciting to her.
The Desert Island Discs is discovered at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who is not present in the play environment, is put on a bench in the Ryder Cup game that Saturday
American Philip Mickelson will make a new record on Sunday when he plays his 447th - Cup game but has to change his play style so as not to make this unhappy record.
Mickelson, who plays on the event twice a year in the 12th year, is placed in a stage by Captain Jim Furyk in a four - part soccer match.
Rather than being attended by crowds, as was the custom in American sporting events, this victorious conqueror used half of his day without playing and training himself with a view to correcting his problem.
Although he is at the top of the game, the 48 - year - old athlete is not well qualified to play in the Le Golf National, where grass comes in and makes it difficult for the soccer players to play.
Whether the playground is a fear - inspiring one, Mickelson, in the ninth play Sunday, is facing Francesco Molinaryri, who is the top ball of the British Open, who has cooperated with Tommy Fleetwood, who is still studying to win all their games in this report.
If the Melikas, less than four points. If they could well start 12 out on their own, Mickelson’s game would be more important than that.
Furryk has expressed confidence in my husband as expected.
"If he fully understood his role this day, he who struck me back gently put his arm back and said he would be ready for tomorrow."
"You’re really self - confident.
She has found a place of honor and added much to these groups in the past period, and this week.
I didn’t think he could play two games.
I thought that she would play better than she did, but it didn’t go as we had hoped.
He wants people to know him, like everyone else.
Mickelson will go beyond Nick Faldo’s record of many games in the Ryder Cup game of the Church.
It can make his decision on the Ryder Cup which does not differ from his own record as a person.
Mickelson has overcome 18 times, divided 20 times, and lost Furyk’s presence to the group.
"He laughs, he has bad humor, he responds quickly, he likes to people, and he is a good person to be with him in the unit rooms that he explains.
"It was a thrill to see young players laughing at her in this report."
He provides nothing but happiness."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that it can be lost in a rapidly running position
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows that we can easily lose the position of progress as the group continues to move ahead in the Ryder Cup but that can change forever.
The game started in 1997 in the game at Valdermar, where the case that the Sever Ballestros had been paid was five times higher than America but when the latter was completed, it won in 1471-131.
"You will tell yourself that you have many points in Valderrama; you have many articles in Brookline, where we were held and Valderrama, where we won the victory, hard," on the clock Bjorn, photographed in 2018, after watching the 2010 drama won 5-3 Friday and yesterday in 10-16 of Lelf National
So history will teach me and everyone in this group that you have not yet accomplished this.
We'll remove all of what we have tomorrow
We will do all we can.
This is not yet complete until the points on the board are made.
We have a purpose, and it is to try to win the battle against it.
Once again, I look at the 12 players on my side, but we know what we are facing in the case of one of the other players who have left all over the world."
Thrilled by the way his players played in this tough playground, Bjor added: "I didn’t really think about this.
Tomorrow we say something different.
The next day a personal toy is checked, and a different thing is different.
It’s easy to be with your mate when things are going well, but when you are alone, you begin a test of your strength as a runner.
That is the message, which is forced on all players to receive, they must prove themselves tomorrow.
Now, you don’t come with your mate and must show yourself again."
Unlike Bjorn, man on the other hand, Jim Furyk would look for his players and not as a group but as a team without Jordan Appeit and Justin Thomas, who received three of the four articles.
Furyrik, who has been in both of these aspects of the last day’s change, was on the side of Brookline when winning and losing as Europe performed the "miracle on Medinah."
"I remember everything he said," answering that Ben Crenshaw was the record of 1999, and how interested he was when they came to the last day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but it is not to be borne in mind as he saw it in Brookline and Medinah.
Once you start winning each day, you put pressure on the game in the ring.
We organize our players according to schedule and install them in a way that will have good results, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned to pay for the return of the war and is faced with Roy McIlroy in the upper game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Polurter in the upper half.
"I’m going with this group of men on this schedule because I think it’s up to everything," says Bjorn to this individual choice.
The German Warships have been restored.
The new merchant ship should be released in 2014 to replace the warships known as Cord War, but the following year will not be released because of the problems of the ship and the cost, says the news.
The removal of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," which is the target of the other ships issued by Baden-Wuermberg-Class flagates, is reduced by the first half of the 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit as a military general.
The ship should not have joined the navy in 104, but the coming of the goods has made it possible.
These four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg in 2002 and will replace the Bremen ships.
It was known that there would be a powerful instrument, along with fireships and aircraft as well as other technologies that kept you out of sight of Radar, infrared and acouchistics.
Another important factor is that it takes a long time before it needs correction and it can go through the rest of the two years.
Nevertheless, ongoing disturbances make these new ships known to supply Germany with energy across the country, and they are out of date when they are driven.
This moored ship was issued in the news last year, while the German navy tried to bring the ship back to Blom & Voss in Hamburg.
For the first time the navy returns the ship to the dock after it is launched.
Little is known about the reasons for returning behind the ship but the German news that there are problems of "the machines and goods" that make the ship more efficient when it is at war.
The machinery was more important as the ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg are employed by 120 people and half of the people who are forced to use the old Bremen.
On the other hand, it appears that the ship has a very heavy weight to reduce her ability and that the navy will not be able to improve it in the future.
This vessel with 7,000 tons of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to have two ships larger than the same ships used by the mines in the second world war.
In spite of the out - of - date goods, the cost of all this work - including the cost of training employees to use them is starting to become a problem.
It is said to have reached 9973.1 billion ($3.6bn) — from 972 billion.2 billion
The problems of these new ships have been significant when it was shown that the power of the German navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans- Peter Bartels, chief of the German Parliament Security Committee, admitted that the navy is ‘ losing war ships. ’
The officer says that the problem is the age - old problem as it continues, since older ships have been discharged from the army but were not added to new ones.
He then said that no other ship in Baden-Wuerttemberg was able to enter the navy.
New Trust heeds the news of flying animals like rats
New drawbacks made at the Scottish Highlands want to explain how the animals use their habitat for food.
It is hoped that the results will enlighten us about how these animals behave and how they can be protected.
This is a study conducted by the Scottish National Trusts of the Scottish National Trust that will follow these familiar animals, making noises such as that of the soprano, the long ears of the Oubeton’s Oveveld in Wester Ross.
Special recording presses will be placed in an important area of the site to determine what they are doing during the year.
The NHS employees and volunteers will do their research with hand - operated machines.
Calliologists will check all the recorded records to show the calls of animals and what this type does.
A map of the dwelling area and a report will be made to provide a picture of the behavior of these animals.
Rob Dewar, an environmental consultant for the NTS environment, hopes that the results will be seeing these animals come to love the environment and the places where they are used.
These details will help us to know what benefits are available to protect the zoos and how to keep them where they live.
The presence of animals in Scotland and the UK has been reduced in the past 100 years.
They are at risk for the construction and development of zoos.
Air and light can put these animals at risk with flying papers and chemicals from buildings, as well as by cats.
These animals are not blind.
Even so, their ears often come up with their eyes to catch food each day.
They get their food by making noise when you return to their ears and see what food they can eat or what restrictions they have on their flight.
The NS, responsible for caring for more than 270 older places, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land in the country, think these animals are important.
It has ten trained professionals, making resuscitation, checking their accommodations, and sometimes rescue.
The site has built a special site for the animals in Scotland at the Threave state in the Dumphries and Galloway, with 8 species of animals
The site’s director, David Thompson, says that the place is the right place for them
"Here in Threave we have a beautiful place for these animals," says.
"We have old places, old trees and a comfortable place to live.
There are many animals that are unknown to man, so our work here and elsewhere will help us to understand what they need to live."
He says that the importance of examining these animals before taking care of the environment is as if the habitat of the animal can be damaged by 400 children and the chimpanzees, which could end all of that.
These animals are protected and illegal in order to kill themselves and their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, director of Scotland’s Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged public assistance.
He said: "There are still many that we must know about these animals and many of their kinds that we do not know.
Ronalo has protested charges of fraud and will then publish a German magazine
Cristiano Rolando calls rape charges false, claiming that people want to bear his name.
His representatives will register the German press Der Spiegel, the main source of accusations.
The Portuguese player and Juventus are charged with rape of an American gang member, Katryn Mayorga, in a hotel in 2008
He is said to have been responsible for $375,000 to say nothing on the occasion, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
Concerning a 452 million of his followers in just a few hours after the charges were made, Ronaldo, 33 years old, has denounced himself as "false."
"No, but only," only, "but only,".
What they say today is a lie, and this victory of Ballon d'O'Or five times to the camera.
"They want to make myself known to the people by my name.
It is normal.
They want to be known by my name, but it’s common to me now.
I am happy and well prepared," added this player, who laughs.
Ronalo’s attorneys claim that they were prepared to register the Der Spiegel with these charges that said "an unfavorable report of charges which abuse personal life," according to Reuters.
Justice Christian Schchertz says that the player wants to be a ‘ spiritual wrecker because of the abuse of personal rights over the past years. ’
The event is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the alcohol center, Ronalddo and Mayorga are said to go to the performer’s room, where he was raped back, according to paper posted at Clark County County County in Nevada.
Miorga says that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident in which he was accused and what was "the good man" "99 percent" the problem is one percent."
The bishops said that Ronaldo had made sure that the couple stayed together, but they had agreed.
Myorga says that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries to the hospital, but later they agreed to argue without the court because she was afraid of returning and worried about embarrassment.
This 34 - year - old says that he now wants them to go back to work because he says that he still causes Ronaldo pain.
Ronaldo was then to join the Real Madrid from Manchester United when the charge occurred, and in this way he went to a large Italian band of Juventus sold at a cost of £100 million
Brexit: UK will ‘ regret forever ’ for the loss of car manufacturers
UK "will regret forever" if he can lose its position as the leading driving force behind Brexit, says engineer Greg Clark.
He added that it was worried that Toyota in UK told BBC that Britain would travel through the EU beyond the discussion will stop a little longer to produce their company in Burkinaston, near Derby.
"We need a connection," says Mr. Clark.
This car manufacturer from Japan said that the risk of getting out of the border when there is no association in Brexit can complete the job.
The Burnaston product - which produces Toyota Airs and the Avenensis – has produced nearly 150,000 cars during the past year 90 percent of that wave to other countries in the European Union.
"My point is that if Britain goes to the EU at the end of March we will see the development cease from our development," says Marvin Cooke, the governor of Toyota in Burkinaston.
Some UK manufacturers have expressed their fear of passing EU without any connection as to how to trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, will close its Day product at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
A serious concern about this can also pose a risk to trade if there is no association in Brexit.
The Toyota development list is carried out by a program "at the appointed time," with car equipment arriving every 37 minutes from the UK and EU vendors in order that cars should be developed to be purchased immediately.
Even if UK is traveling in the EU without a connection in 29 March, there may be a disturbance on the border where the business may be slow and inadequate goods.
It will never be possible for Toyota to have enough goods for a day at the production of the Derbyshire, to say this business, and the production will stop.
Sir Clark said that the policy of Theresa May and EU was "born to be less sensitive to this border examination problem."
"We need a connection. We need a very nice combination that will allow us to take this opportunity," which tells Radio 4 of the BBC class called Today.
"A testimony not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers explains that we need to continue where we were in full development."
Toyota has not appeared as to how long the production will last, and if for a long time, caution that the rising cost will reduce the skill of competing in time after completing the project.
Peter Tsullavaris has worked for Bernaston for 24 years and the Unite of this statement says that they are more anxious. "I know when this work is going on, I will never return."
A government spokesman says: "Let us bring a reliable plan for future planning with EU.
Trump and Rosenstein conference can be reviewed, according to the U.S. president’s office
Donald Trump’s vital assembly and general representative Rod Rosenstein can be reduced for another week, as did the election of the highest court by Brett Kananaugh, says the president.
Rosenstein looked forward to the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who conducted research on Russian elections, as well as a conference between Trumps and Russia and the violation of the legal arm of the president
That Trump throws him away from the rest of the community, endangering Mueller’s independence, has been the cause of much gossip in Washington during the past months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein said that he would wear a head covering to record a discussion with Trump and that it would be possible to clear the president of 25 adjustments
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But on the last day she went to the White House, between the reports she was going to ignore.
Instead, the meeting and
Trump said that he would "not choose" to expel Royntein but then the meeting was on duty to avoid controversy in the Commising Senate where Kabanaugh and one of the participants accused of sexual immorality, Dr Christine Blaey Ford, both gave a witness.
On Friday, Tump has authorized a one - week FBI investigation against Kavanaugh, which has brought it to the attention of the full Sanate.
Trump news correspondent, Mrs. Sarah Sanders, comes from Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about a meeting at Rosenstein, she said: "The day you are not used, otherwise this week, I saw that a week’s repetition of the week was given to all other events in the high court.
But we will see and always want to keep the depression updated. "
Some scholars would argue with this: The Sandersites have not followed the White House line since 10 September.
You might say that Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of arguments was not due to the confusion of TV "mass," although he said: "I would not agree with what they look."
He suggested that you direct the contact between the Trump and the mountpress.
"The president makes sessions and sessions better than any president before," added without counting the evidence: "Look at these numbers."
Reports will happen, Sanders said, but "If the printer has the opportunity to ask the president of America directly, it is better to talk to me.
We try to do so and have seen him do much of what in the last few weeks and will take place for printing when you can speak with the president of the United States.
Trump always takes questions when you leave the White House or participate in open sessions or join the conferences and the moving expressions.
Solo news conferences are a disaster.
In New York this week the president may have shown why, making a flagelling and occasionally invisible before meeting the news.
The Health Secretary writes to the EU staff in NHS Scotland about Brexit fear
The Health Secretary has written the ESSc workers at NHS to express their appreciation for the country and wish they stay in the Post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months until UK dropped to the EU.
The Scottish government has devoted itself to meeting the cost of EU environment requests of citizens working in public services.
In his letter, Nksz Freeman wrote: "During summer, discussions between the UK and the EU on the replacement have continued, focusing on the expected decisions in the autumn.
But the UK State has proposed its plans regarding the impossible situation.
I know this should be very disturbing to all.
That is why I want to regain my appreciation for the support of the entire crew, no matter what country they are.
Brothers from all over the EU, and above all, bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve health service, and assist the sick and the people we use.
The Skotland is your living object and we want you to stay here.

The Tennessee State State Backbucker Chris U-Abercrovia was elected immediately after a head abuse on Saturday 31-27 of the Vanderbilt Committee, reports by Mike Organ.
President Rust Reed of the Council of Tennessee tells the press that it was possible to get hurt in a short time.
"He came to the side line and fell down," says Reed.
The trainers and medical staff presented the Abercrovia to the ship on the course before she was laid on the bow and returned her test.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrenza was not opened to the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that there is no "meal information about type / amount of damage at present" and the Tennessee State tries to determine when the injury occurs.

Investigators will be paid to purchase property in the UK
Exporters will be paid when we buy a UK package and additional cash used to help the homeless under the new Tory settings.
The increase will reduce Corbyn’s success in pulling small votes.
The increase in camp work will be paid to those who do not pay taxes to the UK
The Nondyebo is expected to rise to £120 million per year in assisting the homeless.
Some salesmen are used to pay for the high level of tank work when they buy UK - with additional goods used to help the homeless, Theresa May will bring it today.
The increase will be seen as an attempt to reduce the progress of the Jeremy Corbyn to draw small voters with vows to provide for the purchased housing and to focus on the finding of higher ones.
The increase in gun labor will be paid by individuals and taxpayers in the UK, and the additional income to improve Russian driving against sleep.
The additional fee for the work of the modern stamps, including the high levels imposed two years ago in two private homes and in the purchase of a job may be 30 percent.
The Nodbo is expected to rise to £ 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new buildings constructed in London are purchased by the UK population, to transport costs, and to make it difficult for the first consumers to get foot on the level of housing.
Many rich areas of the country - especially of the capital - have become "city" because of the high number of foreign customers who spend their time in this country.
The new policy will come weeks after Boris Johnson asks that the gun be cut off to help new people with their homes.
He is persecuting large firms in the construction of a high - level platform by removing the land but not using it, and he urged Nkzi to stop the platforms in the purchased homes to repair the "submarine" of Britain.
Sir Corbyn has brought in a list of proposed buildings, including the control of the chain and the end of the discharge.
He also wants to give many large committees to build new homes.
Msz May said: "Last year I was going to give your premiership back the British dream - so that life would be better for each new generation.
And that means repairing our house market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build up lives here.
Even so, it is not possible for blind people to the UK, as well as foreign - based companies to buy homes as hardworking British residents.
For most people the dream of home ownership has been far away, and the destruction of painful sleep remains real.

The Scotts, 42, explains the challenge of restoring the North-Asest bridge, now staying in the third part of the League One, three top.
She moved to the Stadium of Light after leading St Mirren to the Premiership of Scottish Season.
I want to play my country as a player.

In view of the building and center of the game, there is no doubt that in Premier League, "she said."
"It is not easy to find it, but perhaps I will just look out for success here to return to the group."
Ross only three years in his administrative capacity, after a time as a helper to Dumbarton and 15 days in the Coaching stoff.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the introduction of the third, and changed St Mirren from the position of support of Championship in the following respect.
And Ross say that he feels more comfortable than he had during his play in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, Stirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"It was possible to be real," she recalls, by taking Allía.
"I really believe that the rule is better for me, than to play.
It sounds good because I did well, made a beautiful life, and enjoyed a lot of fun.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you have to do to make each week.
I am still under such conditions as stress and work pressure, but the control feels right.
I always wanted to control it, and now I do it, feeling free to be in my purse in my life all the elders."

Total pint time is 5.30pm on Saturday, research is seen.
The summer type of heatwave has encouraged the removal of heavy British bridges but more heavily imposed on restaurants.
The Pub and Bar groups saw a 2.7 percent sale in July - but taking in restaurants was less than 4.8 percent, showing the number.
Peter Martin, of the consulticia is Business CGA, which included these figures, said: "The continuing of the sun with England for a long time may be expected you to participate in the World Festival of July to follow the same pattern in the past year of June, when pubs are up to 2..8 percent, unless the dining facilities are difficult.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the merchant store in June increased considerably by July.
Bedbugs and excess hatches are much more like love than low dining rooms.
Pobs led by food were also destroyed by the sun, although they are not as extreme as those who are eating.
It seems that people want to get out of bed.
Of all the pubs carried and drinking bars were over 6.6 percent during the month, with a 3 - percent diet.
Paul Newman, entertainment analysts and visitors, RSM said: "These results continue with the spirit we have seen since April.
The weather and the impact of large social or sports matters remain the main thing when it comes to selling foreign markets.
Not surprisingly, groups have continued to fight, although a 4.8 percent of the annual market market will be particularly painful at the expense of continued expenses.
A long - term hot summer that has not come at the worst time for drivers who lead the food and time will tell that the temperature taken at August will give you a lot of breathing.
The growing trade in the pubs and stores, including new openings, was 2.7 percent by July, shows the improvement of the band outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker of the UK Pub, bar and food division's food chain collects and analyzes the data to work from 47 operating groups, with a combined cost of more than £9 million, and a standard medical indication.

Doyle was a Scottish driver and Scottish assistant and Internet chairman Ian Beatie described walking as a good opportunity for those leading the games to benefit from his high international experience over the past ten years.

Monetary pump advertising by comparing mothers and cows to split the Internet opinion
The pump company has divided trade views on the Internet as well as a declaration that identifies the young mothers of captured cattle.
To highlight the start of what is called "the first case of brathebbup," Elvie's professional firm has issued a mic-in-cheek theme video display to show the new freedom the pope gives to announce mothers.
Four mothers who have a cancer in the barn are made up of cattle in channels that include such sounds as "Yes, I am a female, but you don't see the tail" and "If you haven't noticed these things, they don't."
The cousrus continues: "Pumpnt out, pamp, or, I feed the baby, ppopi, pup, and put my girls in it."
Nevertheless, a advertising, printed on a file page, caused a conflict on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of tribes, the video has received mixed answers to viewers, many say it means ‘ a disorder ’ in the milk industry.
"A proper solution uses cattle to announce this product.
As if they were pregnant and breast - feeding to produce milk, unless their babies were buried in it before the delivery days, "to write one.
The Elvie gun is perfectly compatible inside the storage vessel (Elvie / mother)
Another said: ‘ Mother and baby are clearly concerned.
But why not use them to publish a pump pump to the mothers who will keep their children? "
Another person added: "Not appearing on sale."
Some defend the declaration, one woman admits that she has found a “clean ” song.
"I think this is mankind’s opinion.
I’ll have one to fill.
Cheating made me feel like a cow.
The announcement was somewhat painful, but I took it.
This is a psychological product, "one wrote.
One said: "This is a beautiful advertisement directed to the pump mothers (usually at their workplace or in public places) and they feel“ like cattle. ”
This is not a declaration that recommends or judging the milk industry.
At the end of the video, a group of detectives show that they were all playing along with sensitive pumps.
The theme following the campaign is based on the fact that many well - known women have felt like cattle.
The Elvie Pupp, however, is totally silent, there is no lire or destruction and has a strong link within the bight, gives women freedom to walk, hold their children, and leave them out.
Ana Barin, who compared herself with ECD to Mother, said: "Elvie smoke is such a product of a change that was appropriate for the development of liver and touch.
By showing the similarity between women and milk cows that wanted to put on the breast and all the physical challenges, when it reflected how pleasant and unthinking freedom it would bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump made a point.
During the week of the Sonson of Mondon, the mother of two children was seen in the sundalk, Marta Jabowski' while using the product.
The majority of the People of the River are busy at the Texas Borderr Bank
The number of children employed to move out although the flow of the lunar boundaries remains constant, because of the section that the hard control and systems made by the Trump system make it difficult to place children and support them.
According to custom, many advocates have become foreigners, and they threaten their ability to live in this country by developing a child - calling process.
The risk increased by June, when the government authorities announced that supporters who could support themselves and other older members of their homes should wear fingers, and if the needle will be joined with the authorities.
Last week, the Timesu Albence, the upper court and the Change of the Sect of the Percession and the Perceptions, testified before the Council that the Aarente holds a large audience that applied for the support of the children who are not involved.
The attorney later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests did not have reports of crime.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who support certain advocates or family members are here illegal in the country, and the main public is these law - enforcement tourists.
So we continue to pursue those people, "Let's say Mr. Albence.
In order to advance children quickly, the authorities promise new laws that would require some to appear in court within a month, soon after 60 days, the most earlier restrictions, in regard to the local staff.
Many will appear to be a telemarket, rather than a person, to justify their case in the case of the law in the immigration court.
Those who are considered unfit for freedom will be quickly removed.
For a long time in the cell, children can say that they can become anxious or depressed, which can lead to the end or the escape, according to pension workers and reports from the program during the months to come.
Supporters claim that this concern is raised at a large center such as Tornillo, where the traits of a child’s relative can be forced, because of its size.
They added that taking children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare for themselves physically or to say that friends can undo many of the damage they had.
Syria tells US, French, and Turkey that it is rapidly dependent
In view of the United Nations Assembly, President Walid al - Moueram also called the Syrian refugees home, although the world war is now eight years old.
Mouleram, also serving as prime minister, has illegally said to the outside forces of Syria, under the sense of fighting against corruption, and "to be taken properly."
"They must drive away immediately and without restrictions," said the congregation.
Moulem stressed that "the war of an event is occurring in Syria, where more than 3,600,000 people died in 2011, as well as millions of others have been displaced from their homes.
He says Damascus will continue to fight this holy battle until it completes the whole of Syria."
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, generally training and counseling the Kurdish and Syrian troops against President Bashan al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 wars on the ground in a war - torn country
In the case of the refugees, Moulam said that these restrictions were good for her to return, and he said that "other Western countries" because of spreading the irrational fears that make refugees live far away.
"We have called national areas and human organizations to provide this tax," he said.
"They have treated the police what should be the concern of the people."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no further reform in Syria until a political treaty between Assad and antiwar opposition.
UN connections say that a newly formed agreement between Russia and Turkey is established at the stage of the tapon tower of Idib created an opportunity to promote political talks.
The Russian language of Turkey attacked a large - scale Russian army, where three million people live.
Moulem but insisted that the agreement " has come for a long time" and that it shows hope that the participation of the war will focus on the radars as well as on the Al-Qaeda-completion fighters with the Nusra Front, "that will be destroyed."
UN ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon join the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to establish the principle of Syrian war and the direction of selection.
Moulem set the circumstances to hold the cooperation of the Syrian Government on a committee, saying that the administrative work of the engineering must be prevented from being "renewed by current principle," and warned against disturbances.

Not surprisingly, the 17 of Pennsylvania sees a flood of waste, due to a change in the case of related debts in the places connected to the same seat.
The region that was recently destroyed in Pittsburgh recently came to be in the Democratic Seep.
The Lamb works against another recognized person, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, which now represents the 12nylvania district, which weighs most of 17th.
The map was raised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had sentenced in January that the older provinces were not under the Constitution in favor of the Riphabk.
The competition in the new 17s has prevented the financial campaign of luglfest between the great financial assets of the group, the Democratic Committee of the Committee Committee (DCCC) and the National Community Committee of Cultural Affairs (NRCC).
The Lamb became a common name in Pennsylvania after a small guest on a special March 18 of the Central District District in Pennsylvania.
The chair was driven by Riphabbuki for more than 20 years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 degrees.
Political politics have given the Democracy little limits.
U.S. scaled Penazing El Salvador by Chinese support support, then supported
Deplots say that the Romancan and Panama Republic has chosen Beijing, never leaving Washington.
Mr. Trump had a delightful meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until a companion took over the administration of the Trump Organization.
The government Department has decided to restore American delegates from El Salvador, the Romacan Republic, and Panama to about "the previous decision to be ‘ destroyed soon to see Taiwan, ’ says Heather Nauert, commenting the Department, in a comment on the Department, in a post this month.
But the judgments were considered only about El Salvador, which earned $140 million about American aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
Planned punishments, which include the election of financial support and the protection restrictions aimed at it, would be painful in the North American country and the absence of high jobs and homicide rates.
As the inner conferences progressed, North American and North American officials have reduced the high level of security and economic prosperity to follow the same convention last year that was considered a major step in preventing migrants from going to the United States.
But in mid - September, the senior officers explained that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively eliminating any considerations of El Salvador’s judgments.
The Vice-Presidant Mike Penence is now prepared to deal with conferences, now arranged in October, for a demonstration of access to control positions at this conference.
And the three Americans automatically sent to El Salvador, Panama, and the Romanian Republic without heavy messages or messages from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton was refused to comment on the conversations described by three American officers, including two adjoinings, who agreed to discuss private conversations in unknown situations.

Reading history
The next guide to drop may be the special advice of Robert Mueller’s report on the defense of justice, where there is much evidence in public details.
Mr Mueller is said to answer his research and that Mr. Trump’s campaign is linked to Russia’s attack on our choice.
If the Congress will change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself faced with responsibility in that body, as you are ready to go back to the voters, perhaps eventually becoming a judge of his peers.
This is so much, and I would not want to show that Mr. Trump is inevitable - or beyond Europe.
There is the choice of our choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will prevent the extent of a long struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch Hitler, if only the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid years of bloodshed.
The course of history goes round about such points, and a democracy that cannot be supported immediately or delays.
The Americans look at the current articles.
What will we do to get Mr. Trump to smoke Justice - General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the Future of Inquiry by Mr Mueller?
Rosenstein had been in the hot water since the paper that, last year, she was quietly advised to write the president and to explain it inappropriately to the office.
Mr Rosenstein says that the News account is incorrect.
"What will we do when a new FBI investigation asked for F.I. Brett Kananaugh investigation is not only accurate or appropriate if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court in spite of sincere accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote among the N. Trumps?
If we pass that test, democracy will be in a long winter.

Another black man?!
NY nanny cans two after shooting after the word "ethnicity"
The New York nanny tells a couple quoted after receiving a wrong text from a mother complaining as "one black man."
The couple object to being impartial, likening the suit to the "pouting."
Lysey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when he found out that a new child minister, Gikelle Maurice, was black when he arrived on his first day of work in 2016.
"No ONE," wrote Nksz Plasco-Faxman to her husband in a quotation.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Nkz Maurice, twice.
After recognizing his giffe, the Plasco-Flaxman was dismissed by Nkz Maurice, saying that their ex - African, formerly African, had done a poor job and instead expected a Philippianso, according to New York Post.
Msz Maurice was paid for one of the jobs and returned home in Uber.
Now, Maurice corrects the couple for payment, and she needs compensation for $350 a day for six months, the gig which she lives in her first month, if she has no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such things," he told the mail on Friday, adding "I know that they are opposed."
The couple had been accused of being racially prejudiced, saying that quitting Maurice’s job was the logical thing to do, fearing that they would trust him after making him angry.
"My wife sent him something that I did not like to say.
He is not a Jew.
We are not of racial background, and the husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"Would you place your children in the hands of a person who had rushed, even though it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come. ”

"Are you going to follow such a person?
That is not the best thing to do, "A bank of insurance is added.

The Paddington publishers feared that the students did not fit in with the speaker, a new publication showing
Sand’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said: "It’s hard to put on the shoes of someone you first read before you were printed.
I’m now surprised to know about the great success in Paddington.
He says that his father, who worked as BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a book for children with a small letter, would be a rare man about his banned work, adding that for 60 years this book was pleasant "after his death last year.
In Paddington, describing as "the most important member of the family," he added his father to his sudden success.
"He was old, and he was not a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington was true to him, it was difficult for you to have a child who is perfect: you are proud of him even though it is not true.
I think he had watched Paddington’s success as well.
Although he was his creation and his opinion, he kept paying his debt to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and had to play on the phone
His daughter had been rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.

"After that I received a call from Nad that he would die within two minutes and I had to tell him.
And I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you very much, and I love you.
I will be with you soon.
I’ll be better.
Doctors gave her medication to keep her heart beating faster and left her routine.
He was at a loss for some time before the hand extended, and all of this was shut up.
I had to stay and wait, knowing that all of that would happen.
I could not cry or cry or cry because I was placed in a condition surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold my hands together. "
Finally, Sir Edna-Laperouse, now sad to lose her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who did not realize her problem.

Sub-Programmes to protect oneself from thebridge
Two women who have lost a loved one in suicide try to protect others from taking their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards to the Welsh Bridge with encouraging messages and telephone numbers to ask for support.
Nkz Davis son Tyler was 13 when he began to become depressed and commit suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel as I would do every day," he said.
Msz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that his son was a promising cook with an infectious disease.
"Everyone knew it because of his smile.
They were always saying her smile.
Nevertheless, he quit his job before he died, since he was “in a dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the only one who could find his brother after he was alive.
Mrss Davis said: "I’m always worried that there will be an argument."
Ms Davis created cards, "to allow people to know that there are people outside where you can communicate, whether you are friends.
Don’t be quiet - you have to talk.
Msz Humphreys, who has been a friend for years with Nks Davies, lost his 15 - year - old partner, Mark, shortly after Mother died.
"He doesn't mean that he felt down or depressed or anything," he said.
“ A few days before Christmas we noticed his change in attitude.
She was in a hole under Christmas when the children opened their gifts without contact with them and anything.
He said that his death was a great blow to them, but they had to work with it: "You boast of a hole in the family.

Brett Kavanaugh’s future depends on secretary as the FBI begins research
"I thought, if we could find something like the one that asked him for a long time, it is limited in time - perhaps to bring in a small unity," says Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the committee "to separate from the combined grid.
Why did Mr Abanaugh and his republics of the Republic want the FBI to investigate?
Their lack of response is due to time.
The choice of the latter will last five weeks, November 6 - that, as it is supposedly, the Riphabkites do wrong, so they will be too weak in their efforts to find a man who wants to be appointed to the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush had been taking the phone to call Senators, asking to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the Western House in Mr Bush and met with his wife Ashley, who was the secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happened after the FBI published its report?
There will be a vote on the Senate, where the Republics and the 45 Democrats now sit.
It is not yet clear that Mr Kabanaugh can reach 50 votes on the Denate level, which will allow Mike Ponce, president, to break the ladder and convince him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean Defector number 'down' under Kim
The number of authorities in North Korea to South Korea fell from Kim Jong-un to power seven years ago, saying that a South Korean lawyer had said.
The National Azeong-seg, which mentions the date from the South social service, said that there was a security of 1,127 last year — compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park says that the relative control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher rates paid by the transportrs.
The Pyong did not make public opinion.
Most of the refugees from the Northern Hemisphere are eventually provided by the South Koreans.
The Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have legally collapsed since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled China, the highest border in North Korea, and it is easy to cross the Dilitised Zone Region (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China refers to participants as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often return again and again.
The relationship between the North and the South - which had legally served in the war was more successful in the coming months.
Earlier this month, two world leaders met at Pyong with lectures that focused on the symposium.
This occurred after the historic June meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jung-un in Singapore, when they openly agreed to work in the Korean peninsula without nuccle.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Minister R Yong-ho says that the U.S. judgments are due to a lack of progress.
"Unless of faith in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, no way will we take advantage of it for the first time," says Mr Ri speaking to the National General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaug "Card," she says she is not ready to serve in the Supreme Court.
The little head of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court Justice Brett Kananaugh and said that he would not be qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi answered the Saturday conversation at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if the woman had done that way, they would say 'help,' Pelosi said about her reply to Kabanaugh before the Court of the Court of Appeals on Thursday.
The Kabanaugh was legally admitted to having been sexually active by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
During the opening session, Kabanaugh was deeply moved, at times shouting and talking to his family and his high school years.
He clearly judged the democracy in the committee, which called for the "comparative and individual organization" consisted of the valuable institutions if Hillary Clinton had lost the national choice of 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh is proof that she could not serve in the Supreme Court, since it indicated that she was abused in Democrats.
"I think you are ready for such arguments and how the Clintons and Democrates follow them," he said.
The emphasis was placed on the fact that he would try to interfere with the defense of the Kabanaugh, and that the Democracy received much from the Court of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this - if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or FBI, so he isn't worthy to be the Supreme Court, but if he is in the present court," said Pelosi.
A Kabanaugh is currently the judge in D.C., the Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she was concerned about the judgment of the Kabanaug Act or Roe v. Away, as it is considered to be the final justice.
In confirmation of his imprisonment, Kabanaugh had answered questions about whether he could change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time for a dangerous, aloof individual to go to court and wait for us to say, 'It’s not,' says Pelosi.
And wives want to protect it.
A good metatribe, month and years of burning anger, and she cannot do it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs. Steinam said to me 45 afterward.
"I don't think something unusual, isn't it?"
He went on to say, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a local ruler, who also cried when she was shouting, but he developed a process that meant that when she was thirsty and started to cry, he said to the person who spoke to her, "You think I’m sorry because I’m crying.
I’m angry."
And he kept on walking.
And I thought it was wise.
Tears are allowed to become an encumbrance response because they are not fully understood.
One of my strong reminders is more severe than the first job, in the man - made office, where I found me crying out with unexplained anger, had scruff at my neck by an elderly woman, I always had a lot of fear of who drives me to the stage.
"Don't let them see that they are crying," she told me.
"He knows you are angry.
They think that you are sad and will rejoice because they come to you.
Patricia Schroeder, then Colorado’s Democratic Society, had worked along with Gary Hart in his presidentship.
In 1887, when Mr Hart was caught in a farmhouse called Monkey's Shirt and left the contest, Nksz Schroeder, he was very worried, he might think that he had no reason not to get the idea of conducting the president himself.
"We didn't have a good decision," she said to me with laughter after 30 years.
"There were seven who heard in the contest, and the last thing they wanted was one.
One called "Snow White and the Seven Best."
Because it was after the campaign, it was after financial support, and she vowed that she would not enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost war.
He found that some of his supporters who contributed 1,000 money to the men would give him only $250.
"Do they think I’m going to find a break?" she wondered.
When he gave his talk that he would not establish a legal campaign, he was seized by the feeling of gratitude to those who have supported him, frustration, and a system that makes it more difficult to raise money and hire voters than delegates, and anger on socialism - if he had grown up.
"You think I’m going to be confused," recalls Mrss Schroeder about how the printer reacted to him.
"You think Kleenex was my support company.
I remember thinking, they would place them on my stone?
"Have you been"? "
How the US-S-Sye-Chinese war can be a good thing in Beijing
The portalvos of the trade between the US and China was deaf, and while the fighting is far away, the conflict between countries can be useful to Beijing for a long time, experts say.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, dismissed the first warning in the early part of the year by threatening foreign speechs involving solar, steel, and alumenium.
A remarkable increase is arranged for this week with new $,200 billion ($50 billion, U.S.) interest rates, rightly for all the items that come from China.
Beijing is re-renewed again quickly, the Italians has just paid the fine to the rate of $60 million of America.
China has promised to compare the US sot-shot-shot, and most of the world’s economics may not be able to unite any time soon.
Getting Washington back down means taking the demands, but bowing down to the United States will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, president of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing can properly play her cards, the forced U.S. wars can certainly help China for more than a long time by reducing reliance on other countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make conditions that begin to disintegrate the economy in this country is certainly more dangerous than viewers have seen before," says Abigail Grace, an active friend who is actively actively influencing Asia, says America’s New American Security Council.

Another six million people who live in this country need help.
