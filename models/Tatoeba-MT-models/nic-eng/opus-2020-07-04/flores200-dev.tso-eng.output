The stars emit light and heat because of the energy generated when hydrogen atoms are combined (or made into one substance) to form solid elements.
Scientists are working to develop a tool that will similarly produce energy.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to obtain and will take years before these tools are developed.
The metal needle floats on the water because of the strength of hold.
The force of gravity is produced because water molecules are more attached to the water than they are to the air molecules on which they are located.
Water molecules form an invisible layer of skin on the surface of the water that allows such liquids to float on the surface.
The steel on which an iron mill is attached to the current, and the two sides bend together. The two sides give the strength to hold the ice, and when it is bent.
Because under the iron it is finely pressed, when the metal bends to the other side, which is connected with ice, is also the ice.
When an ice object bends to the right, the rider turns it to the right, if the power to move it to the left.
To return to the amount of energy they had, they needed to remove the increasing energy they received from the light.
They do this by releasing a small flash of light called "fothon"
