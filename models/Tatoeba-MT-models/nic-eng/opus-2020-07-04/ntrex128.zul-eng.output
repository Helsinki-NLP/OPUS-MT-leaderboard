The Welsh AMs are concerned that they will ‘ look like little bugs ’
They ask themselves to answer some among the AM in the view that it changed how they are called MWPs (Menmer of the Welsh Parliament).
This is cleared up by programs to alter the calling of the Welsh Parliament.
The AMs in every political party is afraid that this will call for ridicule.
Another view for Labour AM is that they are afraid because there is the same sound as Twp and Pwp.
To students outside Wales: According to Welsh Wilsh tup, the pwp means a fool, and pwp means a waste.
About Plaid AM as a group they were very happy and offered other names to choose.

In June the Commission published the results of a public poll in opinion, which found great impetus to a movement called the Welsh parliament.
In the case of the AMs, the chain is established by WMP and the public opinion has shown dependence on the MWP.

The rules of repetition are concerned with the change in the operation of synapses, including the regulations for the AM and the order of the cup.
The AM will have a final voice in the question of what will be called when the law is discussed.

He had many warriors.
Captain Halkett was prominent, his wall is solid, while Menga kept Conn or Gordon and Joe Worroll on the entire game.
Rangers had a hat, but it was.
Or they do well under Gerard’s circumstances and suffered the loss of those standards.
Their last shots have opened the family bone – Rangers must rise from the ceilings, as they find themselves in the middle of the table.

The release shows the difference between views of a visitor who has won a victory over the German Turks and as a rival.

Some people have climbed into the trees and fled to the Tsunam, saying.
Some 17700 persons were transferred to 24 offices in Plulu.
Photos taken by a disaster department showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed, and destroyed along with a flooded kitchen.
The quake continued to move the coastal city all Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was known in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian's Agency for the Assasment and Appliation of Technology (BPT) says that the cement cement released by the earthquake on Friday was 200 percent the energy of the atom bomb to Hiroshima in World War II.
The town’sgeography, located at the end of a long, small section, may increase the intensity of the tsunami, they say.

It’s too bad.
Even as relief teams began to blow the bells to help, some complained that deep - seated foreign workers had been forbidden to leave Plu.

One West West: changed his name to Yes.
The current Kane West changes his name - Y.

The U.S. must raise the support of A.I.
Since China is more active in the I.A., the U.S. should double the number that uses research in the field, says the economist and AI, Kai- Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Annotations from after the various sides of the U.S. government have made an announcement in AI, just as the U.S. general is not a formal AI plan.
During that time, China started its program last year: planned to divide .1 to AI in 2030.
"AI project will be a good start, since all other countries are too far behind the U.S., and we want the next success to AI," says Lee.
Conflicts with financial support can double the likelihood that a large AI in the U.S., Lee told the CNNC in a discussion of this church.
Lee, her book "AI Superpoliters: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order "printed this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Chief of the Sivulities, has planted it in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Fair +.
In the 1980 ’ s at Carnegie Mellon University, worked on the new AI program for the American Othello player, and later became the director of the Microsoft Research and President of the Google branch in China
Lee agreed to a U.S. technical contest as the First Amendment Department of the Robotss Challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help him see the following industry.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to overcome government provisions, says Lee.
"No Chinese removes educational leaders; companies," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technical companies have used lights from the university to work on AI years later.
Lee said that the changes in the purpose of migration can also help the U.S. to strengthen their AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be operated automatically to PHD on AI," she says.
The Chinese Council issued for Promotion of the next Generation’s Intelligence Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
The China National Natural Science Foundation has issued money from educational institutions such as the National Science Foundation and others, but the market for academic activity is small in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of the year. Defense Department has defined the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must include the executives of the community as well as the academics, and the White House has announced the construction of a special stamp of the Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announces $2 Billion in a program called AI End.

Macedonians decide whether to change the country’s name or not.
Macedonians decided on Sunday to translate the name of the country into "Request of North Macedonia," an attack to resolve a conflict with the Greek nation that has already lost the status of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which calls Macedonia and its province, continues that their neighbors on the north side of their trail look for their place and want to enter the so - called NATO and EU.
Both governments signed a pact, but some say that changing the name means to look down on the culture of the majority of the Scalics of the Slavs
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote and signed votes made it uncertain that 50 percent of the people would be present until the reception is legal.
The question on the vote sheet reads: "You agree with the membership of NATO and the EU with the Greek agreement."
Those who agree with the name have, according to Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is what you can pay for now to produce such elements as the EU and Nato in Macedonia, some of the lands that have developed the breakup of Yugoslavia
"Last night I came to vote for our country’s market, so that young Macedonians will live well under the European Union because it explains all our neutral health," says Olivera Georgijevska, 79, Skopje.
Whatever the case, sufficient members of the parliament came to agree with the vote.
The change will require two thirds of the cement joint to eat.
The national polling commission says that there were no reports of differences in 1 p.m.
However, it had been in 16 percent, with 34 per cent of the previous parliament in 2016 while 66 voters signed their votes.
"I have come out to vote for my children, our place in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, a lawyer in the city, Skopje.

Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardkov, 54, repair the scenes and pull up seats in front of tents by those who would resist the elongum.
"We shall not have NATTO and EU, but we want to join and raise our heads, not through the door of the guard."
"We are a poor country, but we are modest.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonians, we can convert others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro - Asia adoption."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring about the economic growth required in Macedonia, with an average of over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority of our citizens will fight with EU and NATO," said Zaev after getting a vote.
He said "Yes" results "to guarantee our future."

Note: The Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the wall of all the Brighton guards to operate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling threw down the Brighton wall on the Manchester City victory in 2-0 yin on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very easy for his 65 - minute article.
The Argentine blossom is cut off from the stomach at the start of the plan.
It is hidden among the three Brighton guards, before crossing the court.
Aguero found herself surrounded by four green baskets.
He has removed one under hold before passing another pile into the Brighton box.
Then she cries at the left, finds Sterling.
The foreman hits the ball right back in the box to Aguero, who uses his right shoulder to win the tower of Brighton, Matthew Ryan in an article on the left side of the net.
"Aguero is still faced with problems at his feet." The City administrator Pep Guardila tells the news.
"We have spoken with him about playing for 55 minutes, or 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were fortunate not to make the gondola in it for the moment.
But it was Sterling that gave Sky Blues an opportunity at the beginning of the Premiere League partnership.
The gondola is released during the 29th hour.
Aguero found a ball in the voice of Brighton players in that game.
You have sent a sweet ball on the left hand to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched it before she led Sterling toward the park.
The Sky Blues' crew touched the ball and entered the needle almost out.
City connects with Hoffenheim in Champion League to a game that will be playing at 12:55 afternoon at Rhein-Necker-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Schezer wants to play in the canker faced.
The National Association was then driven into the play off competition, no longer to force another start.
But the controversial Schcherer wishes to enter the court on Sunday to face Colorado Rockies, this is possible if the Rockies face problems with plaoffs, and have won one game by controlling Los Angeles bridges in the West and NL.
The Rockies still hold a single song-card player by winning 5-2 when long before facing the Nationals on Friday's Friday, but they still watch to hold their first bit of fiber protection.
"Even if there is no play, what's left is that once we have reached the Denver position of its adherents and this one group will be playing the best game I have ever faced this year.
What can make me want to play there? ’
Nationals are not the publishers who will play Sunday, but it sounds as if they can let Scherzer enter the contest.
Schcherzer, who may have entered for 344, had a bullpent on Thursday and will be calling on Sunday on his rest day.
This Washington right-handman has 2,53 ERA and 220 strikeouts in 2/3 in the city.
Trump is busy in West Virginia
The president has taken his speech to a position surrounding his choice of Brett Kananaugh to the Supreme Court when stressing the importance of the issued of the Republic to the internal election and leadership.
"All that we have done is on the stake in November."
In five weeks before making the most of important choices in our health, it is a matter of course.
This is one of the larger ones, especially --I don’t run but can say that I’m running, so I’m everywhere fighting for the winners, ” he said.
Trump has gone on, "You see this vicious, violent group of Democrats, which is the one you see right now.
They are also willing to return to power in any way he can find, to look at cruelty, and to pollution.
They don't care about who they are, nor who is to blame for their injury, nor who has to make them to rule and to receive power, that is what they want to control and strength, that he will not give them."
The Democrats, as he said, are in a campaign of "the revolt and confusion."
"And if you look at these four days ago," he said, calling the Democrats "not cruel, cruel, filthy, and untrue."
Then he refers to the Sanate Legal Committee calling Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Democrat by name, which drew her water through a stream to the crowd.
"Do you remember his answer?
Download document?
Ah, yes, I did.
No, indeed, it was as if standing by one of his own standing did not tell me good news — I had never seen a man’s stand so rich."
The Work Group is no longer a congregation of anyone.
They no longer speak of what is in their minds.
When the terms of Momentum in my team were prepared to shut my mouth, I was not surprised at all.
But, in fact, I have later entered the MP team of employees who have been told that they are not accepted — simply because of the speech in our opinion.
My partner, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment for anti - Semitic resistance.
In my case, those who wanted to keep my lips in check criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the point of the importance of the financial system considered, in national security, in Europe, and in other surprises Jeremy has been competing with other leaders.
In a statement of the Nottingham East Labor Committee for the Friday Meeting, "We want the meetings to be free from prejudice and admiration."
For almost two years I was the 45-pounder team of our crew, the GC meetings on Friday' day have always been all.
Sadly, it does not go like morning meetings and the promise of a ‘ compassionate, mild - tempered ’ political promise has long forgotten if, indeed, it has ever been.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different ideas are no longer allowed to exist in the Working Group and that views were judged as acceptable to the leaders of the group.
This begins shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and my siblings, who said that we had similar political views, have seen me turn around and take sides that I would not agree with — whether of national security or on a single EU market.
Whenever I talk in public, it’s no longer important and if I’m going to come up with a wave of harassment on the social networks that tells me that I’m not expelled, that it wastes unsupervised politics, saying I should not be in the Working Group.
And I’m not the only one who has to face this challenge.
I know, however, that I am better than my own, since the talks referred to me are still political.
I am still amazed that my siblings are still holding them at work and their determination not to brag about themselves in the face of sexual or racial prejudice.
One of the most discouraging features of this political era is the way torture rates have become rare.
Jeremy Corbyn said that at the last week the Labour parery must establish a custom of boundaries.
The fact is that we do not see this great church and its lack of confidence or change in the law of disassociation.
I have had many counsel over the past two years being urged to lower it, not too much to talk and it will be "right."
But I’m not interested in politics.
Since I had mixed myself with Labour 32 years ago as a student, I was disgusted by the government of Tatcher by leaving the broken school floors, I wanted to bring the best public services to those who need them most – perhaps as local government or as government minister.
I have never hid myself from politics, including the last choice.
No one in the Nottingham East can in any way be confused about the law of the land and the debategrounds of current leadership.
For those who have missed the trip on Friday, all I can say is that when the world continues to move on to Brexit that will hinder householders, business and our public ministry, I don’t want to spend my time and energy faithfully with the leader of the Allaur party.
But I really have one message that I have in Nottingham Momentum, to those of mine, whether members of the Allar, or not: I decide by serving you and I promise that there will be no threats or politics that will prevent me from doing what I believe it will be best for all of you.
Leslie is the Nottingham East
Ayr with 38-17 Melrosse: Ayr has never been separated up
Two later tries have ignored the final results, but no doubt Ayr is worthy to be commended for this excellent modern Tennent's Premiership game.
They are now higher, which is to betray on the side of the ten who can be defeated.
Finally, their defense, whenever the opportunity allows, including the home and tutor Peter Murke, has every reason to be happy.
He said, "We have been tested all our games until now, and we have never failed, so I must be happy."
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr honor, take advantage of every opportunity more than we are."
Grant Anderson’s 14 - minute stanchion was installed by Frazier Cmií, who puts ahead Ayr, but, Cap Roy Hughes of Socland received a yellow card, was released from Warriors, which caused Melrosese to make his own pockets and Jason Baggot to hold all the figures.
Cyla n't round Ayr went ahead with a penad, just before, on the first hit, put a ring to make 17-5 on Ayr during a break.
But Melrose in the second leg is well started and the tritry of Patrick Anderson, fitted with Baggot, was reduced by five points.
Then there is the arrest of time due to severe injury Ruaradh Knott, she was thrown out with a piece, if they were from and Ayr strongly continued with Stafford McDowell's trikall, fitted with Colla.
Ayr's supporting captain was given a yellow card, and, Melrose is heavily in debt with Bruce Colvine, finally in power.
My family had returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow shirt after he picked up Clamo without a ball, except the line of the paint, MacPerson hit down the Ayr.

‘ The sea is ours: Bolivia’s officers hope that the court will open the Pacific route
The crews of gigging-clads and the main tower in La Paz.
The compass-builders lift the flag of the acen-blue.
Naval bes from Lake Titicaca to Amazon contain this poem: "We're the sea by right
Recovery is our job.
In all parts of Bolivia, memories of coastline were lost in Chile in the 19th century, the spring is still clear – as it is eager to go to the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes that perhaps more than your age, Bolivia is waiting to be dominated by a global court of reform on October 1 five years later.
" Bolivia has the Power, the spirit of unity and submission, and it is indeed eagerly waiting for the outcome," says Roberto Calladella, who speaks Bolivia officially.
Many in Bolivia will watch the ICJ ruling on large screens everywhere, with great expectation that the Hague court will reap a Bolivia’s appeal – after years - long talks – Chile is forced to talk to each other by giving Bolivia control of the sea.
Invo Morals, a suitable Bolivian president who faces a long race with a choice in the next year, he has much to do with Monday.
"We are very near to return to the Pacific Ocean," which swore at the end of August.
But some critics believe that the court has little opportunity to reap Bolivia - and that name will change if it permits it.
The Netherlands-supported the UN body has the power to guess the parts of Chile, determined that the effects of speech can be prevented.
That ICJ ruling came only six months after the debate was heard to say that the matter was "not difficult," says an expert on the international law of Chile, Paz Zárarate.
It is also clear that to accomplish Bolivia’s purposes, four years ago they may have turned back.
"The case of permission to use the sea by the Bolivian authorities," said Zarate.
Morales ’ violent speech upsets the cooperation of the Chilean, so it puts it.
Bolivia and Chile will at some time continue conversations, but it will be very difficult to continue reasoning after this.
Two countries have not changed with representatives since the year 1962.
The former president, Edurdo Rodriguez Veltz, representing Bolivia in Hague, has dismissed charges that the court is too quick to make a decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique chance to start a new time of contact with Chile" and the opportunity "to establish 139 years of exchange for the interests of both countries, ” put it.

"The decision is an opportunity to show that we need to win the past."
North Korea says that the ban on nuclear weapons will not take place unless they can trust the American.
North Korean foreign minister R Yong Ho says that his country will not stop being armed with nuclear weapons first unless they trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at an assembly of united countries.
He urged the American to follow his promises at a convention in Singapore among the rival leaders.
His observations were up to the time of America. The world writer Mike Pompio looks at the first in danger of a nuclear dispersion after three months of Singapore and Kim Jon Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is an impossible dream that the continued purity and resistance of the U.S. agreement to end the war in Korea to make North Korea afloat.
The Washington is very aware that he does not agree to make Pyogang announcements before beginning to destroy his weapons.
Both Kim and U.S. / American president Donald Trump require a second conference.
However, there is widespread lack of awareness that Pyong is determined to give up weapons that the world may consider to be the only way of safety.
Pompio plans to visit Pyong the next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.

John Edward: Cultivation of the mill is important to residents in the continent.
Private schools in Scotland keep details of good results, and this has been carried on in 2018 with other fine results, which are confirmed only by personal and fellow sports, art, music, and other public efforts.
With a growing number of 30 thousand students in Scotland, these classes are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCISs), who are concerned with providing advanced help.
Private schools are designed to prepare students for a high level of education, as well as for their choice of field and environment as citizens of the world.
As an educational center that can organize and introduce a special education program, we see modern - day lemons continue to be a popular and popular garden as a chosen study in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak with a man in a hearing song, what you say comes directly to his head."
If you speak with him in his own tongue what you say to the heart."
This is a strong reminder that we will not always trust the English if we want to cultivate friendships and trust in foreigners.
From the results of this year’s tests, we can see that vegetables are the main means of the gathering in private schools.
Thirty - eight of all the students who had learned foreign fields received the Supreme Class A.
The indications, gathered in seven and four SCIS schools, show that seventy - two percent of the students have received the Supreme Class A in Mandanin, since some seventy - two percent of the students who read German, sixty - nine percent of the students of those who read French are sixty-three percent also read Spanish.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools promote foreign languages as vital skills for children, young people without doubt will need them in the future.
It is now a subject for which you can choose, being viewed as the same as the basic courses (Scientary, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in schools that represent the educational system and elsewhere.
A UK Commission for Employmeny and Skills in 2014 found that 17 percent of the phonetics (17 percent) were produced by language loss.
Therefore, the ability to speak languages is especially important in preparing young people for work opportunities.
By means of many expected tasks that identify languages, these skills are vital in a united world.
No matter what field a person takes, if he learns a second garden, they put themselves in a better position to keep their future in the way of a master.
Being able to communicate directly with outsiders puts a person able to speak many vegetables before his competitors.
According to a report by the Youth Gov, over 4000 adults of the UK (4,000) in 2013, seventy-five percent were unable to speak well of foreign fields and have a good conversation, and French is the only member of two - percent adult population, fifteen percent (15 percent).
There is no room for farm farming that is important to children today.
Having many territories that you know, especially those in developing countries, will help reduce children’s potential for finding a better job.
In Scotland, school and school differs from one language or another.
Most of these schools focus primarily on teaching older and more advanced lemons, while others teach territories that are considered of great importance to the UK in view of the year 2020, such as Mandanin and Japan.
Whatever your child likes, there are many types of vegetables in which you can choose from private schools, and guide the experts in the area.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to providing a form of education that will prepare the children for the children and impose the skills that they need to succeed, this time the future holds.
In the present, business around the world, it is said that the fields will continue to play an important role in the future of the world, so this is no longer a matter of academic achievement.
In fact, modern lemons must be included in "toy global communications skills."
Private schools will continue to offer this opportunity, variety, and ingenuity to young Scotland.
You have to do well.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.

The Ryder 2018 U.S. group trusts to fight and keep its hopes in one day’s sports.
After a three - side convention, on Saturday afternoon, the Ryder Cup games may have been four times longer.
A full - blown weapon is a program of sport that is started but that is what the players believe, which can be compared.
Where, then, would they say that they are stronger now?
"They lead six points and are now just, so we continue as if by a little power I think" says Jordan Spieth as they drive slowly in the day.
Europe has opportunities, indeed, four points ahead of the twenty.
The Americans, as Spieth put it, have little happiness and much to be encouraged, not in the way Spieth and Justin Thomas played together all day long and each got three points.
Spieth has always been dangerous and is leading her by example.
Those watching the scene were so happy when you were on your own, long - suffering is essential for the match of the game when Thomas himself was at each other’s side.
His shots won the game in 15 the same excitement, this kind says that he believes that the American team has not yet gone out.
"Surely you will have to dig deep and worry about your game," says Spieth.
One of the players is now remaining.
Eighteen holes to place them on a sign.
The only one who has more chapters than Spieth and Thomas two days ago is the Francesco Molinaliri and Tommy Fleetwood, not asked in this Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but the match that is very good and willing.
"Moliwood" is the only attorney who will not start a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but avoid the bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
This flight, according to both pressures, comes from this noisy crowd who conclude that they are the winners of the Church, and there are no more stars who will be eager to conquer Europe as the Sun kills the Golf National than the Fleetwood or Molinaryri.
Both are exactly the same hole
Even so, the remarks about Europe’s popularity have not changed.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did little work for Sergio Garcia, the early hours of the morning, when Alex Noren was arrested.
Bogey alone the leading doubles leave a long gap in Spain and Swede that will never cover it.
On Sunday, no one will help you get out of your pit.
Fourbals just foursomes enjoy a close look because of the cooperativeness of the map, the advice they give, the advice of the so - called experts, and the quickest solution.
Europe played well as a team and led it to the end, but the photosomes showed that the USA still had the power to continue, by choice the United Stateside.
Europe took 10-6 leading on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will be on a fair party on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the same fourbals on Saturday on 10-6 leading the United States.
do Tommy Fleetwood, and Francesco Morinari won twice more than hard pull Tiger Woods on four points of the Golf National.
On the European side of Thomas Bjorn, a willingness to take a cup that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, a failure in the U.S. to the fourals on the left, put a 31 series.
The U.S. has made it harder and harder to stop theforsomes, to win two games, but it will not only provide a bear.
Jim Furyk needs nine points in 12 Sunday games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first one in Europe to get facts for himself in order at the same time, calling him "Molleyed" after a good weekend, and four points from their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
By cutting Woods and Patrick Reed into the foubals, they then introduced themselves to the Bryson Dechamau of America in 5&4.
Woods, attending two Saturday games, showed great determination but now he has lost 19 of the 29 seconds in a row.
Justin Rose, staying in the early morningforbals, went back to holding Henrik Stenson in theforsomes in 2&1 to divide Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third stage of the world.
They are also willing to return to power in any way he can find, to look at cruelty, and to pollution.
Jordan Spieth and Justini were thrilled three times to cross the Americans on three points on Saturday.
They got 2 K1 by cutting the Jon Rahm right into the Spanish Ian Pulter and later split the Polbals together Roy McIlroy in 4 Koursomes while cutting through two open pits.
In history only two times to have a group from four points to isolated games, on the other hand, Ryder Cup needs to measure only to protect the cup.
After doing better for two days, or so, the Sunday attack seems to overwhelm them.
North Korea says that he will not be ‘ armed without confidence.
A North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that it continues to undermine loyalty to the United States, and it is impossible for the world to release nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
The Ring Ho told the World General Assembly that North Korea had made a “recognised ” year ago, such as preventing nuclear and testing nuclear weapons, eliminating nuclear sites, and promising not to promote nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons.
You said, "Even so, we don't see any answer from the U.S.."
"Not trusting in the U.S. will have no hope to be secure in the world and under this situation there is no way we don’t prepare ourselves first."
At a time when it disagrees with the North Korean index on Washington’s refusal to end the nuclear age while North Korea may be fined by taking steps, the parliament is a witness that it does not prevent total nuclear extinction as Pyongs have done in the past.
Ri refers to a statement set up by Kim Jung Un and Donald Trump for the first meeting between the president of the U.S. and the director of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim asked for work in the "renation of the Korean Peninsula" when Trump promises for protection of North Korea.
North Korea had always wanted to put an end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States had given Pyong to launch nuclear weapons first.
Washington has been refusing to release North Korea.
"U.S. insists on "The end of the beginning" and sets the rate of forcing the law to carry out its aim by force, and also reject the "pronounce to end war" says R.
"To understand that the law can lower the idea of people who don’t care about us.
The problem, though, is that continuing to make progress only increases the level of insecurity that we ourselves have experienced.
RI did not specify the programs for re-uniting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader of the United Nations has emerged from the kitchen.
At least three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Myo Jae-in in the last five months and added: " If part of this issue of the end of the nuclearity is in South Korea and not the U.S., the elimination of Korean paint will not result in these commitments."
Or it is said that, the sound of R’s speech was completely different from that last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that the U.S. is the principal place and North Korea's rockets that took place after "M. The Bad Judge" Trump called Kim "rocket Man" in this case.
In this year the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "by completely eliminate" North Korea, Kim’s boldness to take action, but much remains to be done and the law is still in existence until North Korea’s end of the nuclear age.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he has no time for all of this, saying, "If it takes two, three, or five years, there is no problem."
The same Russia argued as the U.N. Security Council.
Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: Security Council on Thursday: "Secondation of the Security Council must proceed with force and never fail until we see the end, fully, and fully, evidence of nuclear extinction."
The Security Council has agreed to support North Korea’s violation of law since 2006 in establishing nuclear payments and Pyongsite system.
Pompeo met Rima with the U.N. General Assembly and said that after all we were to visit again Pyong next month for the second preparation.
Pompio had been visiting North Korea three times this year, but his final visit was not good.
He left Pyong in July which progress was made, of North Korea only by making it known "by forcing as a criminal."
Northern Korea arranges a meeting with Myon this month to complete a stop zone and a nuclear combination when the United States takes "the same action."
Kim, she said, told me that she wanted to strengthen safety when Trump promised to Singapore and created a general atmosphere of fellowship with Washington.
Harvard course students help them get enough sleep
The new Course at Harvard University this year is too much sleep in order to overcome the practice of concentration using caffeine ‘ all night.'
Education fields have found many students in advanced universities to be of little value when it comes to the basics that they can take care of the dog.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and even a counselor in Brigham at the same time Women's Hospital, has developed course, the first of the type US.
He was encouraged to start a console after giving a talk on how much sleep I get from reading.
‘ At the end of it came a little girl to me, and said, 'Why am I told this now, in my middle age?'
He said that no one had told him about the night – that had surprised me, ’ and told him the Telegram.
Curse, released for the first time this year, informs the students of the importance of getting enough sleep habits to help the park and exercise, and improves the daily welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's Health servis, said the university had decided to die of course after learning that most students do not sleep at all during the week.
The length of the study includes a series of steps taken.
The first section has a picture of the school room, when students choose coffeons, elections, trainers and books on the effects of caffeine and the light of exercise, as well as how to sleep.
On the other hand, half are told that avoiding long sleep increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The compass map, with practical markings, will encourage those who share in encouraging them to reflect on their daily routine.
‘ We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
We believe they have the right to know — just as you have the right to know about your health by choosing to smoke, ’ adding Professor Czeisler.
The culture of the ‘ community ’ is a practice, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students reduces the degrees of sleep as a problem.
To ensure sufficient sleep, enough enough, it must be a student’s ‘ secret weapon to overcome stress, fatigue and anxiety, which means to avoid obesity, since insomnia puts the mind into a hungry state, causing them to become hungry.
Raymond Shuthi, a 19 - year - old student in California who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare a study, had studied at one of his first classes during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the study had opened his eyes and that it had motivated him to take the study to the whole center.
The next step, with hope, is to invite high school students to learn in a way similar to this literacy program before joining this well - organized competition center.
Prof Czeisler recommends that the students must consider digging the alarm while they are going to sleep, and also that they will wake up nin, with understanding of the bad effects of ‘ the blue light of the sky ’ produced by the electric lights and the light of the LED, which can be released from the ring ring, which leads to the degree.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga article lowering Gerard’s men
The Rangers had been organized and moved while under the control of Dolly Menga, which attacked the joint case of Steven Gerard failed 1-0 in Livingstone.
The Ibrox long intended to record their first victory since they had won on February 41 in St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holt's team of the second division of Gerard in 18 games as the director who left his back on eight points of the Ladrokes Premiershits.
Try to attack seven minutes before the half-time and Ranggers endure without the force of the army.
When Rangers now descends on the sixth stage, Livingstone descends to the third point and after the Hibernian point.
And there may be a problem coming on the Rangers after he has listed Cum Spence with the first aid after an acoustic accident caused by something turned away.
Gerard made eight changes on the previous side of Ayr to Betred Cups.
Holt, on the other hand, took the same Livi 11 out of Herets last week and would rejoice in the way your well - dressed clothes turned off the air around.
Rangers may have held the ball too high, but Livingstone has done much about the mine he has found.
They could have walked in two minutes during Menga’s sleep to send Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s article, but the performer lost much of the opportunity to drive the team.
Kegan Jacobs Freeck received Craig Halkettoi-skipper's freeck, but his matchmaker Alan Lithgow has spread far behind.
Rangers had been able to control but was much more confident of them than their belief in their sports in the last third stage of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to get a penatty for us when he was in conflict with Steve Lawlesses, but the poet Steven Thomson has dismissed the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers can insert two points in the first half directly facing the pontoon but the older Ibrosman Liam Kelly with no concern about the relief placed on the head of Lasna Coulibaly and the humble invasion of Obie Ejaria.
When Levi opened at 34 minutes may not have been out of play, no one would deny that they were fit for their work.
Ranggers again failed to resist Jacobs ’ football ring.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallager hit Scott Robinson, our ex - husband, and sent Menga to finish it easily.
Grardube and the movement after a break when he changed Colulbaly by Ryan Kent and this change almost immediately became a part of the race when the driver jumped down to Morelos but an impressive Kelly runs from his check to guard.
But Livingstone has also went on to describe viewers by playing their favorite sport, and Lithgow and Halkett playing long footballs after the others.
Holt’s side could open the lead in the last stages, but McGregor stopped and forbade Jacobs before Lithgow played a ball on the corner.
Rangers, Glenn Middleton, has long found a tetanus when he is fighting against Jacobs but Tyndale is also on the opposite side.
Almanac: Geiger Compute
And now our page ‘ Sunday morning ’ Almanac: Sep Hope 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and BARA ... the day when the physics of the morning Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of obtaining and measuring radioactivity, which led to a product that was eventually built simply by the Geiger Cointer.
The scientific core since then, the Geiger Cointer became the core of the papal pillar, such as in the 1950 "Bells of Coronado," where scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "Geiger Cointer, used to find raocticive monerals, such as ganium.
When inserting open earphones, you may be able to hear atoms released by radiocticticity with minerals.
Evans: "It's going out now."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But this foundation bore his name forever.

The goal of color indicates the promising effect on patients with cancer types.
A woman with a goal set, who teaches the immune system to see the wrong cells, saw ovarian cancer disappear at the end of 18 months.
This method involves taking protective cells from the patient, converting them to "see" standard protein from the majority of cancer called HER2, and recombined cells.
Professor Jay Bezofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a promising goal."
HER2 " is encouraging the development of cancers," including breast, breast, lung, and other cancers, explains Prof Berzofsky.
Another way to take protective cells from patients is to teach them" how to understand cancer cells that have been effective in treating certain types of leukemia.

They threatened me!
And they said I was getting up in the countryside, ” he said, according to the Washington Watchman.

But the director of the conversation, Karen Hunter, wrote to the ticket, saying that West "rew the person who sits on it and just is good."
"But I’ve chosen not to hire anyone (by buying his music or dress or setting his ‘ art ’) that I believe they’re cut and filled with a dangerous idea in society.
You are free.
So it is, ” he adds.
Before the presentation, the rapper checker moved to the Tipter to change his name, which is now going to be called "an old name, Then West."
He is not the first musician to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddyy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and Piddy.

This break occurs after the Kavanaugh is filled with three senator questions.
Old Web sites such as the Gateway Fund and RedS State reported that IP cards indicate that Waters office is related to it and that the primary source of Waters ’ activity, reports Hill.
"These unprovable accusations are false and are not true," continues Waters.
"Business of my workers – ownership, human rights, and safety to the endangered as a result of fraud and lying – did not involve the fouling of the garbage.
These unfounded accusations are false and certainly not true.
The Waters Declaration quickly became critical to the Internet, including the White House’s oldest secretary of influence, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial can be tired, ” wrote Fleischer.
"This means that they do not have the gentleness of the Compulsion Council.
If a person is to blame for something he has not done, he cannot get tired.
They must not deny it.
They should not criticize the prosecutor’s wishes.
They must be cool and at peace.
Fleischer would say that he likens Waters ’ answer to criticism by Democrat Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized by critics who were too tired at the time of the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a member of the Republic, who will enter Waters' shoes on the middle choice of time, also breathe with his mind in the Twitter.
"M large if true," writing to Ticktter.
In his parliament, Waters said that his office would inform the "right officers and a legal committee against these charges of fraud.
"We will make sure that the guilty are exposed," which continues, "and they will be held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions on any side of my crew."
Vision of Johnny English Strikes Against Ain – reduces the power of Rowan Atkinson’s spy pof
It is now customary to view Brexit’s worth in any British film and it does not seem to carry on with the revolving of Johnny English – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and its return in 2011.
Does eating hot potatoes mean that we may have a new opportunity to sell out?
At any rate, the open - eye face of Johnny English who had the authority to promote new products for the second time — is a big joke designed for non - English - speaking audiences.
It is indeed an incomprehensible survey that far beyond even his unusual hypocrisy to glory reveals Clouseau, Mr Bean's motivation and his influence from the Chaiots of Fire ame in the opening of the London Olympic Games.
And it is from the stranger and man of mysterious mystery named Atkinson who passes through modern advertisements and is now a vicious hero on Barclayard TV, who left a void in his resurrection.
There are other and two more times this present visit to JE.
I love Johnny English to ride a cycopter with an old suit of soldiers and a small sword hanging over his helmet.
Atkin’s gift of humor is a show, but laughter seems to be much lower and more dramatic, especially in the product of the ‘ deep ’ as 007 and the Mission Imposable itself now presents humor as a substance.
The stories of me above are grown - ups, and to me, Johnny English’s expeditions have neither shaggling nor shaggling them up and focused on Atkinson’s silent video display and Bean’s personality.
The story on the market now is that Great Britain is in a large bank.
The Ecyber-Hacker enter into your secret network of British spies, revealing a number of British junctures in the field, which bothers the jurors assigned on the job – that is a small task to Kevin Eldon.
The last minute in the prime minister is a black hole, facing a failure in the political community: Emma Thompson is trying to imitate Teresa-may but there is nothing in the text to say about it.
His inspectors let him know that every inspecter has to wait until he is out of his throat.
This means that Johnny English himself, now such as schoolmaster, but gives unexplainable lessons on how to perform the test: these jokes, as English gives the theory of surveys at Rock-type ademy.
Engligigided at Whitehal to be given urgent orders and joined with the qualified Bough, also played by Ben Miller.
Bough is a married man, coupled with the submarine commander, a delightful place played by the Vicki Peppeddine played by him.
So Batman and Robin to make the most of everything in the Queen’s secret Service return, meeting Olga Kurylenko's autinko's autiful dea Ophelia Bulletova.
There, the prime minister quickly draws into the millions of civilizations that he can solve computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their strange journey: hiding as a bar, they started a fire at a restaurant in France; they started a problem fishing boat with Volta; and English that removed the tide when he learned to practice Virtual Reityhead.
All efforts are made to improve the last chapter or to have a friendly and encouraging relationship, rather than the TV of children over everything.
Yes, indeed.
And like some of Johnny English films that I couldn’t control: the British film industry was unable to give Rowan Atkinson a place where he showed his talent?
Labour denies that he had planned to work for Britons for four days but that he was paid for five days
A group of Jeremy Corbyn of the Lavaurs considers a marvelous plan to see Britons running four victims – but paid five.
The team reports that it requires the management of the company to pass on the profits made by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the staff by giving them more day.
The workers seem to rejoice for three days of a typical week — but they pay the same amount.
This concept, says the sources, can fit the economic aim of a group as well as a policy to convert a nation to workers.
The transition to four days is authorized by the Trade Union Congress as a means of taking the time to change the economy.
The elderly Source Labor Party tells The Sunday Times: 'Perioethic tests are expected to be done before the end of the year.
'Not going at night but in four days in the church, but working four days is the practice of reimplanting the economy to harvest the workers and the whole idea of the field.'
The Labour Party will not be the first to recommend it, and the Green Party is binding on four days of work during the 2017 signals.
The purpose was not yet set up by the whole Labour Party, however.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: 'Work four days is not an organization license and is hardly thought by a group.'
Shaw Chanceller John McDonnell used the previous church conference of Labour to express his view of socialism in the economy.
Mz McDonnell said that he is ready to go wild and power back to ‘ unknown guides ’ and ‘ clients ’ in the industrial firms.
The chart also explains that sharks in water firms may not find the entire voter as the Labour government does ‘ draw ’ in the wrong way.
He also made sure to put the crew in company boards and in Onnership Funds to give 10 percent of arbitrate-stector signal to the staff, which will increase in the year the amount of interest that is limited to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy pointed out to "60 Minuts" that a FBI study of Kabanaugh can change their minds.
Brett Kavanaugh’s investigation of the FBI complaints has reduced the time of election to the Supreme Court last week, and raise questions that the findings of the clock can change the way satellites in the Republican influence followers.
In a Sunday - record discussion, "60 Minutes" the interviewer Scott Pelley asked the Republican Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or FBI if he would find something to change their minds.
Kennedy seems more comfortable than her South Carolina companions.
"I want to say, indeed," says Kennedy.
"If I go over to the side, I also have spoken with the judge Kabanaugh.
After I called him after this, the complaints went out, saying, 'You have done it?'
She is stubborn, flippant, and unbeknownst to her.
Graham’s vote, however, seems to have been decided.
"My idea is determined by Brett Kavanaugh and will take a firm reproof, ” he said.
"Dot. Ford, I don’t know what to do, but I know this: Brett immediately denied," adds Graham, describing Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all who reported were not sure.
It has been 36 years since.
I don't see anything that changes.
What is the Global Citizen Factory and Has Failed to Reduce Pollution?
On this Saturday New York will deal with the Global Citizen Festival, a annual event with a series of players who are going to play with the same goal; to eliminate the world’s garbage.
Now in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be with the locusts streaming into the large courtyard of Central Park not only to please Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but to watch with the real intention of eliminating rubber in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is a Global Poverty Project, a world power struggling to eliminate poverty by increasing the ranks of its citizens.
To get a credit for this event (except that you want to pay for the LIP tickets), the travellers had to do something "to act" as volunteers, send mail to the world leader, call, or do something more serious to help you sleep.
How successful has Global Citizen in the 12 years remaining to reach its goal?
Is the idea of profiting people in a free concert is a proper way to try people to do something, or is it simply called "clicktivism" – people who feel that they make a difference by signing a list on a computer or sending it to a ticket?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has set the "actions" of their followers over 19 mmlion, taking out the handling of different purposes.
It says that these actions have helped to cut down the world’s explorers on peace of privacy and the goals of more than $37 Billion to affect the health of 2,25 Billion in 2030.
By 2018, the group has collected 390 ideas and declarations from their actions, about $10 villion removed or tried to be collected.
The group estimates that the income has directly affected about 669 millions worldwide.
Another dedication involves The Power of Nutrition, U.S. owners and founders who are dedicated to the "to help children properly," is promised to provide Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate hunger in the world after obtaining 4,700 tuets in the Global Citizen.
"With the establishment of the UK government, the donors, the governments of the nations, and the Global Citizen like you, we can try to make a history of malnutrition due to social inequity," The Power of Nutrition on the National Trecey Ullman in London in April 2018.
The group also said that for more than 5,000 years to call the U.K. improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced a protein support, the Power of Nutrition, to up to 5 women and children by means of a healthful diet.
In response to some FAQs on their Web site, ask "What do you think we can do to clear up the problem?"
Global citzen answers: "It will be a long and difficult way – sometimes it will fall and fall.
But, as civil rights and anti-partheid demonstrations before us, we will win, for we are very strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and others who will enjoy this annual occasion in New York, which will be cared for by Deborra-Le Furns and Hugh Jackman.
US may have made it into the Antillusion "to secure" to prevent the transmission of Russian - Interrior Service
Washington "if necessary" can use the Antillusions to stop the Russian markets of genergy, including the Middle East, the US Internal Secretary Ryan Total, with the Washington Examiner.
He said the discussions of Russia and Syria - clear, when working with official government signatures – is a way of trying new inner markets.
"I believe that in the Middle East they want to find an egg such as in Eastern Europe, and in central Europe," reports.
Also, according to the worker, there are ways to correct him.
"The United States knows, by our army, to ensure that sea routes are opened and, if necessary, are closed, to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke was speaking to those present at the session held by Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls himself "a powerful user's voice" in the US.
He also compared Washington’s efforts to deal with Russia and Iran, saying that the results are the same.
"The choice of trade with Iran and Russia, to a degree, is a means of obtaining and getting oil," he says, when he speaks of Russia as "a crafty horse" and has an investment that depends on oil bars.
The stamps appear as the Trump office made efforts to promote their natural gas supply in Europe, to replace Russia, the most cheap way for European consumers.
As a result, authorities of the Trump office, including U.S. president Donald Trump himself, try to encourage Germany to get out of the North Stream 2 post project, "unfit", according to Trump, which made Berlin "under" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Northern Stream 2 pipes are $11 billion, which are scheduled to double the present volume of pipes to be 10 feet [110 m] in diameter, certainly not an economic project.
The Kremlin says that the ongoing conflict with the Washington project is caused by economic reasons and is an example of unjust competition.
"I believe we have the same idea that power cannot be a tool of stress and that consumers should be able to choose from whom they are buying," says Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Power Rick Perry in Moscow.
The US's position has brought Germany to a decline, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The foremost German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BI), has told the US to withdraw from the EU system of energy and agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interrupts our sending power," says Dieter Kemf, director of the Federal Federation of German Industries (BI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Representatives of 18 provinces and provinces sent a reception to witnesses in Washington on Friday to support a person in need of protection against this aim, reports NBC News.

Large efforts are being made in Plu as the death toll is repeated in efforts to find survivors
For those who have survived, the situation is a condition of eccentricity.
"It is really a crisis," says 35 - year - old mom Risa Kuduá, comforting her son to the building of those who have survived in the city of Palu.

The U.S. ambassador charges China with a ‘ terrorizing ’ of false advertising ’
After weeks the Chinese official newspaper has a four - page advertising for U.S. sales that benefits both the U.S. and China, a U.S. ambassador in China has accused Beijing using an American newspaper to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke of the Chinese Daily donated goods in Des Moines Register - the Iowa newspaper - after accusing China by wanting to join in the issue of Nov. 6 in the U.S., which is what China rejected.
The Trump accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the U.S. election created what U.S. officials said to Reuters is a new category in the Washington oppression campaign for China.
While it is common for governments in other countries to advertise to trade, Beijing and Washington are now confined to a growing trade war that creates an endless chain when they send goods to each other.
The funds that the China wanted at the beginning of the trade were intended to oppress delegates in such places as Iowa, supporting the Trump Republic, say Chinese and U.S.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and the longtime governor of Iowa, who sends most of the agricultural goods to China, says Beijing has damaged American employees, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad on the issue of Des Moines Register, "It is twice as much of this harassment by making false advertisements in our free newspaper."
"In the area that has been distributed, the Chinese government has made itself available to the popular American custom of free speech to the free newspaper by placing a commercial message paid to Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
" On the contrary, in the local newspaper market here in Beijing, there are not many different ideas you will find and you will not see the real response to the different views that the Chinese people may have about the effects of China’s economic crisis, if the news is thought to be looking at the continent Party of China," she writes.
He has added that "one of China’s leading newspapers has fled for his story, although he did not say what that newspaper was.
The Republicans Destroy Mushroom Women Before the Middle Choice Because of Kabanaugh’s Failure, Warning the Spectators
Since many high Republicans are waiting and protecting the risk of being ushered into the Supreme Court, Brett Kananaugh in several charges of torture, critics have warned that the wood will return with the rider, especially among the middle of the seasons.
High lungs in this regard, and many Republicans are already expressing themselves that they wanted to advance with selection.
These things will no longer be reversed, ” Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, telling The Hill in the article published on Saturday.
Reeher said she doubted that the last efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to make a investigation will suffice to make angry voters lower the lungs.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - tomorrow - tomorrow and November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a red counselor and national spokesman for the progressive Move Onn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the reporters shouted, "Come on November!" as they rioted at the Senate hall as the Republicians control Judea Committee and chose to press and select Kabanau in spite of the evidence created by Dr. Christine Blay Ford, reports Mic.
"Decrastion and enthusiasm will end," said Stu Rothenberg, political commentator, addressing the news.
"People say it’s already hot; that’s the truth.
But it may still be higher, especially among women voters in cities and young voters, 18- to 29, who, although not favoring the president, rarely vote.
Even before Ford’s public testimony of his torture charges against the possibility of being handed over to the Supreme Court, critics say that the wood can return with a fan if the Republicans continue ahead and confirm.
"This has been the damage of NGOP," says Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republic National Committee, at the beginning of the previous week, according to NBC Newss.
"It's just about a committee vote or a last election or that Kavanaugh is placed on a bench, about how the Republiccans treat us this and how they treat him," says Guy Cecil, director of the Puritans USA, a group that helps people to choose Democrats, telling the media station.
Americans, however, seem to be divided between whom they believe in the evidence of Ford and Kavanaugh, and are inclined to cross the Kavanaugh.
New figures from You Gov show that 411 percent of the people do not believe in the evidence of Ford, while 35 percent say that they truly or to some degree do not believe Kavanau.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh certainly or to some degree lied to the evidence he had given, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by Folake, the FBI currently investigates charges brought by Ford with at least one lawyer, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford spoke before the Senate Council on a previous week that Kabanaugh had abused her by 17 years of age.
Ramirez says that the defendant in the Supreme Court presented his private parts to him during the session during your study period in Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
The Author of the World Wide Web Setup Starts a New Network to Conflict With Google and Facebook
Tim Berners- Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, sets up a program that will compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The new technology project, Inrupt, is a company built on the open well of the Berners-Le Solid platform.
Soledad allows users to select where their net will be kept and the knowledge of the people who are allowed to reach it.
In a unique conversation with the Fast Company, Berners- Lee made a joke that stated that the purpose of Inrupt is to control the world.
"We must do it now," he says this work.
"It's history."
This applet uses the Solid technology to allow people to make themselves a "personal site online data" or POD.
It can also have a list of people, you have to do, a calendar, a music library, and other electronic devices.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spouty are all available in the same brush and at the same time.
Significantly for the POD store is depending on the user who can get any sort of data.
The company calls it "data that gives you strength."
The opinion of Inrupt, in accordance with the CEO of the company John Bruce, is that the company has brought the heads, penis, and the necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently has Berners- Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, the inventors working on the project, and the manufacturers of many volunteer hotels.
Since this check, engineers around the world may develop their alphas using tools available on the Inrupt computer site.
Berners- Lee said that she and her group are not talking with " Facebook and Google whether it should or should not be brought up to a complete change where all their business is going to be completely altered.
"I don't let them have their permission."
In another photo in the Media published on Saturday, Berners- Lee wrote that Inrupt " wants to provide commercial power and work system that will help protect integrity and a new web site built up in Sold."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Cosortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners- Lee has taken the lead in the debate on neutrality.
Even when Inrupt is issued, Berners- Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Council, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I look forward to the start of this coming web age," adds Berners- Lee.
Bernard Vann: Praised to the teacher who received the WW1 Victoria Cross
The only minister of the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross during World War I has been hailed in his city after 100 years.
Lt Col Teacher Bernard Vann received a prize in September 29 1918 in the attack on Bellenze and Lehauccourt.
However, he was executed four days later and did not find that he had won the highest prize in Britain.
A memorial has been opened at the time of his two grandsons in Rushden, Northampfshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, has said to be a "good sign" that the stone has been opened in the 100th year since his grandfather won the prize.
According to London Gazette, in September 29 1918, Lt Col Vann led his army across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in the explosions and guns."
Later he rushed to the shooting site and “with great boldness ” took the lead before running with a gun and killed three soldiers.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German firing officer in October 4, 1918 — just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, aged 72, says that her grandfather’s actions are "something that I would not be able to do but something that makes me respect him."
He and his brother Dr James Vann put flowers behind the clock, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Bank.
Michael Vann said that "you feel very privileged to have a part in the clock" and said that "the actual military might is shown by the support that many people will offer."
MMA followers stay all night to watch Bellator 206, but they get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay up all night to watch Belarus 206 and be denied watching a party.
The San Jose event consisted of 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown all night pointing to the UK on Channel 5.
In 6am, as Gegard Moususasi and Roy MacDonald were prepared to fight, the UK viewers were left in shock when the station turned to Pepa Pig.
Others were not happy after waiting all night until dawn, especially when they were waiting for the events to come.
One Twitter described this exchange of children's animation as "an unexpected smile."
"It is a government rule that by 6 a.m. this competition is not appropriate and therefore has had to be changed to the children's schedule," "Dave Schwartz, president of the Bellaror commercial and communications president, when asked about this change of schedule.
"Heppa the pig," yes.
The president of Bellar Coker company said that they would check their stocks to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about playing it again, I think we can try to play it," says Coker.
"But it’s six o’clock on Sunday there that we can’t fix this until Sunday in our time, Monday in their time.
But we are on the side of it.
I tell you that during the time of the exchange, there are many of the instructions sent to you, and all of them were not pleasant.
We were trying to fix it, thinking that it was a technological problem.
But it was not, a matter affecting the government.
I promise it will never happen again.
We will keep the sessions up six days as we often do and try to please our followers and go to extremes.
It was not a desirable situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “imated ” because of her sexual intercourse
Olympic athlete Tom Daley says that he grew up isolated because of his sex - but that gave him the incentive for success.
This 24 - year - old swimmer said that he didn't recognize it until he went to high school to say "He isn't everyone who loves me."
Regarding Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, which was published by Lauren Loverne, she said that she spoke of homosexual rights in order to give others "hope."
He also said that if a parent made him or her to win the Olympics.
The average female of the time program, Kirsty Young, has finished working months because she is sick.
From being abandoned in a Lavne's first order, Darley said that she felt "imported" is everybody when she grew up because "It was forbidden to love boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of worthlessness, feeling different, and true feelings have given me the strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to show that he too was a “man, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when he finally found out that he was a homosexual.
The winner who received the Olympic prize twice is the person of a high profile that gives the LGGT and used his position in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to persuade other countries not to view it as a crime against homosexuality.
She said that she has spoken because she feels fortunate to be able to live a life free of problems and wants to give to others ‘ hope. ’
The winner who won three international contests said that he met the U.S. actress Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "unforeseen."
Darley married an Oscar prize, who left her 20 years ago, but she said that being separated by age has never been a problem.
"The more you experience in life at such a young age" - to her early Olympics at the age of 14, and her father died of cancer three years later, she said that it was difficult to find someone who had the same circumstances.
The two had a child in June, the son they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Darley said "His opinion" has changed.
"If you would ask me last year, it would also have to say, 'I need to win a gold ring,' he said.
"You know, there are things more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold chain is Robbie.
Her son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
He said that his father would not accept his death and that one of the last things he had asked himself if they had tickets to London 2012 - the way he wanted to be.
"I couldn't say 'I won't be able to attend those games,' he said.
"I held him by the hand when he was last breathing and until he was last breathing and died when I saw that he was also a person like us," he said.
The following year Darley entered the 2012 Olympics and received a copper coin.
"I just could see that this is what I have been looking for all my life - style — running in front of my people in the Olympic Games, nothing more than that," he said.
It also caused him to choose his favorite song — Heather Small - who has been a fan of the mind during the Olympic preparation and still warm him.
The Desert Island Discs is in BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 11:15 BST.
Mickellison is seated on the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Pil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Boy Cup game, but he will have to lift socks so as not to be a disappointing record.
Mickelson, who will be playing on this event once in two years, is seated on a bench by Captain Jim Furryk on the fairballs and space counters on Saturdays.
Rather than taking the lead, as he often takes the lead in playing the United States, this five - day champion divided into a two - day promoter and worked in his sports hoping to find out what was driving him.
Since he is not a good player who beats a ball even though he is a little longer, this 84 - year - old player is not fit for the La Golf National Games, where the main playground is often a problem if you hit a distant ball.
And if the playground is not so much a problem, Mickelson, who will be playing the nineth in Sunday, will meet British painter Francesco Molinaliri, who can play with Tommy Fleetwood, who is red enough to win their four games in this report.
If these Americans, lost four points in a single player's 12 games, begin well with the game, Mickelson's game can be a decisive one.
Furyyk expressed his hope for his companions, and he said nothing else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, and he put his arm around me, and he said he would be ready for tomorrow," says Furyk.
"You have great trust in yourself.
He is a well - known characterist and has accomplished much in the past, as well as in the journal.
Probably I didn’t think of him playing two games.
I expected more, but that is what happened and what we thought we should do.
He wants to play, like everyone else.
Mickelson will rewrite history Nick Faldo in the number of games he played most of the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It may be his last game for Ryder Cup that has never been the same as what he has accomplished as a player.
Mickelson has won 18 times, she was eaten and played the equivalent of the cable, although Furryk says that her presence has improved the group.
"It’s nice to be with him, you like to laugh, you like to laugh with people, and you’re a good person to be with him in the group room," he explained.
"I think young athletes have enjoyed being with him, and, on this note, it’s good to see you.
He does much more than play.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leading by many points does not matter.
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows that taking the lead in many points if it goes on the last day of the ring to Ryder Cup can easily change into a difficult game.
Dane played for the first time in the 1997 showing in Valderama, when a group with the Captain Seve Ballestero led five points over the Americans but finally took the lead in one point, winning in 141,132-131.
"Keep reminding yourself that we were taking the lead in many points in Valderrama; we led in many points at Brookline, where we were eaten, and in Valderrama, where we won, but in a few points," says Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 Kis of Kisk win on 5-3 Friday and yesterday to take the lead at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in the group that you have not yet done.
Do your best in the morning.
So be honest and do all things in the right way.
It is not until you have learned the facts.
We have a goal, and that is what we focus on.
I have long said this, focusing on our group of 12 players, but we well know what is more than that group’s largest players in the world.
Thrilled with the way his players play in a difficult game, Bjorn has added: "I can’t make any conclusions about this.
The future is different.
The next day, they will decide how each player will play, and that is a different thing.
It’s good to go out and play with someone when things are going well, but if you are alone, that’s when you’re fully tested as a golf player.
That is the message you need to pass on to the players, that you do all you can in the morning.
Now, she leaves her partner behind and has to go and do all she can."
Unlike Bjorn, her rival, Jim Furyk, will see that his players are better playing alone than they have ever been, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, they get three points.
Furyk himself knows both eating and winning on the last day of the last minute, as he has been part of the victorious team at Brookline before eating while Europe is ‘ going on surprises on the Medinah. ’
"I well remember," she always replies when asked how Ben Crenshaw, president of 1999, encouraged his players in the final day.
"We have 12 important games in the morning, but it would be good to start with the upper hand as you saw Brookline, as you saw Medinah.
As that energy continues to mount, you put forth intense pressure on those in the middle sports.
We organized our players in harmony with that and set our players up as we think, will enable us to practice magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been given a job of trying to lead the fight and return from the game and is faced with Roy McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Polter in the upper class of Europe.
"I’m going with this group this way because I think it’s going to be good for all the game," says Bjorn about the selected players.
The German warship is being reconstructed
A new type of German flagship called the Frigate was to begin working in 2014 to replace the old Cord War-rara, but it will not be until the next year for systs and the cost of the snowball, reports local news reporters.
The Rheinland-Pfalz Commission," head of the new ship Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class flagate, is now transferred to the first part of 2019, says Die Zeit newspaper quoted military terms.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that resulted from after the riot threatened the future of a determined project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class alone long ago by the Navy were the only ones to replace the Bremen-class.
Understandably, ships will be equipped with powerful explosives, type of explosives that explode planes and ships with hidden technology, such as lack of location, infrared and noise.
Other important items listed include long periods of care cannot be used by new ships until two years later on the ship’s departure.
However, the ongoing disparity means that the crucial development of naval ships - will provide for Germany’s overseas power has been lost when it started working, says Die Zeit.
The F125 dead ship appeared on paper last year, when Germany Navy refused to use the ship and returned it to Blohmbnase - Vos in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to which it was made after it was brought.
Little is known about the reasons for returning the ship back, but the German press said that there was an important problem with the "soffoil and harwarre" that makes a warship useless when it is sent to the front.
Software problems were particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class will have been used by a crew of 120 sailors - part ship workers of the old Bremen lass.
It also revealed that the ship has a much higher weight than what is necessary to reduce its effectiveness and the possibility that the Navy will be able to put things that will improve her future.
The 7,000 device "Rheinland-Pfalz" believes it had twice the same weight of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides the problem of harware, all its money for the project - including training of a crew of sailors has become a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering $1.1 million ($3.6bn) - from £2.2 million.
New ships ’ problems are very important as there are recent warnings that the power of the German navil was dropping.
Earlier this year, Hans- Peter Bartels, a German president of the parliamental committee, admitted to Navy that it is best "to take care of the exit and entry of ships that are not used."
The officer has said that the problems have been over the course of time, since old ships no longer work but no longer work for them.
She was disappointed that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class were able to join the Navy.
National Trust heeds the hidden life of bats
A new study conducted in the Scottish Highlands area aims to reveal how bats use the environment when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the findings will give us a clear understanding of the life patterns of these unique flying creatures and help direct future conservation operations.
A study of scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow the general popstelles and the black - eared Daubeton bats in Inverted Gardens in Western Ross.
Special records will be set in some places to check the work of bats throughout the year.
NHS workers and volunteers will make small checks using hand-manipulators.
A reasonable analysis of the knowledge of all records will reveal the frequency of bats ’ cries and what some animals do.
A map of the area and a report will be published to create a detailed picture of the area in which he lives.
Rob Dewar, an animal reserve adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which areas are most important to bats and how these animals use.
This knowledge will help to see the benefits of environmental work, such as the megadow Creation and the best way to preserve the areas with bats and other related animals.
Scotland and all the UK bats are rare throughout the last century.
They are threatened with construction and construction work that affects the environment and the loss of it.
Electrics and lightlights can cause danger, and so can fly - killing papers and home - care medicines, as well as attack by domestic cats.
Dolphins are not necessarily blind.
As they hunt at night, however, their ears are more efficient than their eyes when hunting an animal.
They use a complex technique to detect the presence of noise to locate animals and flying creatures.
The NS, which cares for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the world, consider them to be important to bats.
She has ten trained professionals, who regularly practice pollinators, who examine their habitat and how to protect them.
This organization even arranged for the first Scottish island and the only such bats in the Threave in the Dumphries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of Scottish bats live.
The director of the site, David Thompson, says that this is the best place for him to live in.
"Here in Threave is the best place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many large trees, and some ideal places.
But there is much about the bats that we can do, so the work we do here and in other buildings will help us to understand more about what he needs to live."
He emphasizes the importance of testing the importance of bats before working on buildings because it may be possible that damaging one nest may kill some 400 or even a few young elephants, almost all of which live in the area.
Dogs are protected and not allowed by law to kill them, torture them, or disrupt them or destroy their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to come and help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about our bats, and many of our species don't know what it is that keeps them alive."
Ronaldo rejects charges of torture as lawyers plan to pay a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo commented on charges of blasphemy and said "false stories," saying that people "want to improve themselves" by using his name.
His attorneys planned to pay for the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who has published the charges.
The Portuguese player and the Juventus are charged with torture for an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room at Las Vegas in 2008.
He has reportedly paid her $375,000 to close her mouth in this case, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Commenting on the video Instogram Live with her 142 million followers after hours of reporting the charges, Ronaldo, 33 years old, concluded the report "false stories."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, it is false stories, ” said a poet who was dubbed by Ballon d'Or’O five times a camera.
"They tried to create a name for themselves by using a name.
It is normal.
They want to be honored by calling my name, but it is part of the work.
I’m happy and all goes well for me, ” adds the player, with a smile.
The Ronaldo lawyers are ready to pay the Der Spiegel for these charges, calling them "an unacceptable report of accusations affecting personal life," says Reuters.
A lawyer named Christian Schertz said that the player will want to return the money "to the damage of his dignity by the number which he is accused, probably the most critical thing is the recent violation of human rights."
This situation reportedly occurred in June 2009 in the Pams Hotel and Casino at Las Vegas.
After joining in the clubs, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to return to the performer’s room, where he is said to have come back to the player's room, according to the documents posted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after this incident and told him that he was "a person ready" for“ 99 percent" with the errors "one percent."
The dors say that Ronaldo has admitted that they were both engaged in sexual intercourse, but they had agreed to each other.
Mayorga also admitted to the police and took photographs of those who had been wounded at the hospital, but later she admitted that the matter was handled outside the court because she felt "rebuying myself" and worried about“ social embarrassment."
This 34 - year - old woman says that she now wants to change the agreement as she continues to be hurt by what has been said.
Ronaldo was to join the Real Madrid from the Manchester United at the time of reports of these complaints, and this year he changed to a large group of Italians of Juve into a treaty of 2,800 million.
Brexit: UK 'will always make excuses' for the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "will always be guilty" if he can lose his position as world leader in creating cars after Brexit, says business Secretary Greg Clark.
She has also added "it’s disturbing" that Toyota UK tells BBC that if Britain leaves EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production at her company in Burkinaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," says Mr Clark.
This Japanese designer said that the effect of delay on the border when it happens that we do not conclude a treaty with Brexit can cause loss of jobs.
The Burkinaton industry - which makes Auris and Avenensis of Toyota - produce about 150,000 cars last year and 90% were shipped abroad to the European Union.
"I think that if Britain comes from EU at the end of March the product will stand in our industry," says Marvin Cooke, the director of the Toyota in Burkinaton.
Some UK automobile manufacturers have feared coming out of the EU without agreement how trade with other countries will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Oni industry at Oxford a month after Brexit.
What concerns is largely related to what car manufacturers call a risk if Brexit agreements fail.
The Toyota product is carried out in "according to the need of the time," parts of the car arrive every 37 minutes from both UK and EU surgeons according to automated vehicles.
If the UK leave the EU without agreement in 29 March, there may be disturbances on the border that the industry says may lead to delays and the end of the car-building parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day built in their Derbyshire industry, says the company, so the product may have to be stopped.
Mr Clark says that the Rhesa May series of future dealings with the EU is carefully adjusted to avoid the checks on the border.
"We need to get a contract. We want to obtain the best contract that will permit us as well as not only success now that we will enjoy but also take hold of this opportunity," to the BBC Radio program.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but also from other industries is that we need to be thoroughly able to continue with what has been a long - term success."
Toyota could not specify how long the product will be set up, but in time, she warns that increasing costs will reduce industrial performance and will eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burkinaris for 24 years and who is the coordinator of the Unite little factory, says that his members are concerned: "What I have seen when all these tasks are gone and never to return.
A government spokesman says: "We have set a clear and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein conference may be late, says White House
The eagerly anticipated convention of the Donald Trump and the general lawyer Rod Rosenstein may be "rewd by another reporter" as the high court battle and the establishment of Brett Kabanaugh, says White House on Sunday.
Rossenstein supervises the work of special lightjary Robert Mueller, which evaluates Russia’s choices choices, communication between Trump and Russia, and the possible interruptions of justice from the president.
Whether Trump will expel the general lawyer’s rudder, thus endangering the independence of Mueller, it has provided the Washington news for months to be discussed.
At the beginning of this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed laying a tube to record conversations with Trump and the opportunity to expel the president by a 25th blow.
Rossenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday she went to White House, although there are reports that she is going to leave the job.
Instead, meeting Trump, then the United Nations in New York, is announced that it will be Thursday.
Trump said that the "uncamila" does not attack Rosenstein but the meeting is on time to prevent it from countering the Sanate court case where Kabanaugh and one of the women accused you of abusive treatment, Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford, both had been witnesses.
On Friday, Trump orders to have one FBI week's investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which greatly reduces the full Court of the Senate.
Trump news columnist Sarah Sanders, has come from Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The day of what has not yet been set, it may be in this check, I think that it will be replaced by another week as there are other things going on with the highest court.
But we will see and want to keep the news.
Some journalists may disagree with that: Sanders has never had a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The system administrator Chris Wallace had asked why.
Sanders said that the decline of these meetings is not due to the fact that the media are "often talking," although he said: "I will not deny the fact that they are speaking."
Then he points out that communication between Trump and the news will be interrupted in a number of ways.
"The president made interviews and answers more than any other president before him," he said, adding without giving any proof: "We have looked at those numbers."
There will still be meetings, says Sanders, but "if the news gives the U.S. president an opportunity to ask questions directly, that is much better than talking to me.
We try to do that many times and have seen that we are doing much more during the past few weeks and will replace the news conference if you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump usually hears questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in a public chat room or in a news conference with respected visitors.
It is not unusual for him to ask questions when alone.
New York in this report the president has likely shown why, at times, he’s indifferently talking in front of the press.
Health Secretary writing to EU personnel at NHS in Scotland regarding Brexit’s fears
A Health Secretary has written to members of the EU who work in Scotland’s NHS to express appreciation and worldly wishes to stay in the post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter six months before UK had left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already been obligated to pay the required expenses of EU citizens working for public assistance.
In his letter, Nksz Freeman wrote: "At least, discussions between the UK and the EU have carried on, looking to the expected decisions in the autumn.
But the UK government has also been preparing its policies for nonconformity.
I know that this may not be a good time for all of you.
That is why I want to emphasize to myself how much I appreciate the work done by all the members of the staff, no matter which country they belong to.
Our brothers from the EU, as well as elsewhere, bring a precious mirror and skills that strengthen and improve the health service, benefit the patients and communities we work for.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay here.

Merchants from other countries will be paid a large amount of room when they buy a house in the UK
Merchants from other countries will be paid a large amount of room when they buy the UK house to be used to assist the homeless under the new Tory programs.
This will make Corbyn’s success in obtaining young people to vote
The raising of the network will be required of those who do not pay taxes to the UK
The economy expected to earn about £120 million a year in order to help the homeless
Merchants in other countries will be paid for a higher room if they buy a house in UK - this money to be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be considered an effort to make it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to succeed in the effort to attract new people to offer more affordable housing and to be viewed by people with more income.
The promotion of office money will work for people and businesses that do not pay the UK tax, and this additional amount will help in the State’s effort to eliminate the homeless.
This additional income is added to the current budget, including high - profile genes placed two years ago in the second - and - a - three - percent stocked apartments.
The financial people expect this to give them about £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of London’s buildings are purchased by non - UK citizens, which raises prices and makes it difficult for the consumer to obtain housing.
Many areas of the rich in the capital are largely overwhelmed by the ‘ cities ’ because of the high number of foreign customers who spend most of their time away from the country.
A new goal has come after a few weeks by Boris Johnson who spoke of the down payment of the room to help more youths find the first houses.
Opponent the construction business by keeping up high housing prices by taking up construction sites and not using them, and urge Mrs. May to close the customers in the purchased houses to repair the “house scandal. ”
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of proposed changes in homes, including the control of rent and the removal of the house.
He also wants to give lights more energy to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I was going to contribute to the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means repairing the sale of homes.
Britain will always be ready to welcome people who want to live, work, and build up lives here.
However, it would not be easy for non - UKers, as well as foreign companies, to buy housing than are hardworking British residents.
For most people the dream of having a house has become a impossible dream, and the lack of a shadow of sleep on the street never ends.
Jack Ross: 'My greatest wish is to be a Scottish trainer'
Sunderland Officer Jack Ross says that he has "a strong desire" to be a Scottish trainer one day.
Ross, 42 years old, wishes to help the North-Asest group, now the third in the League One, left three points by the upper team.
She moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after assisting the Stirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the past.
"I wanted to play my country while I was a player.
I found B Map and thus ended, ” Ross tells BBC Scotland's Sports.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden many times when I was a child, and it has always been something I think about.
Only then can I get that opportunity, however, if I succeed as an instructor of a small group.
Before Ross in Subland include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Ross, former instructor of Alloa Ataltic, said that he was not afraid to join the main trainers in this large group, since he had rejected requests from Barsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success to me now will be asked 'May I return this group to the Premier League?'
In view of the design and structure of this group, there is no doubt that they should enter the Premier League, ” he said.
"It’s not easy for me to take it back, but I’ll probably view myself as successful where I can return this group."
Ross has been a tutor for only three years, after he is a helper to the trainer in Durbarton, and for 15 months he is a train worker on Herets.
Then he helped Alloa to escape from the belt, and he converted the St Mirren who was almost consumed by the team into Championship in the next village.
And Ross say he feels more confident now than when he was a player in Clyde, Hartlepol, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"All things suddenly changed completely," you remember, in training Alloa.
"I was absolutely convinced that the training job was worth it, more than a player.
It sounds absurd because I played well, had good health, and had fun.
But playing is not easy.
There are many things you should do every week.
I still do those things when it comes to stress and pressure on the job, but I love training.
I have long wanted to train and now do it, and I feel that I am now doing what I want to do all my adult life.

In summer the British pumps have dug up the hard but the fast - food stores are too heavy.
Groups of lungs and rubber have been developed by consumers by 2.7 percent in July - but in restaurants have dropped by 4.8 percent, says statistics.
Peter Martin, of Xubines consultancy CGA, who has received these statistics, says: "The continued success and long - term participation in England means that July has followed the same course as the past month of June, when the tubes rose by 2.8 percent, except that food stores cry below.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurants in June has been worse in July.
Bedbugs and buses were more sold than restaurants.
Sponges also carry heavy food in the sun, though it was not as bad as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to get rid of them would get drunk.
In the lungs and rubber sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent during the month, food fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a entertainer and hosting RSM, says: "These results continue to advance what we have seen since late April.
The climate and the effect of large events or sports events will always be powerful reasons when it comes to marketing.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to draw more and more heavily, even though sales fell by 4.8 percent each year will be painful in spite of ongoing financial problems.
A long, hot summer comes at the fast - food market, and in time the low temperature we have in August will give us what we need."
The increase in sales in restaurants and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent by July, indicating a drop in the percentages of beren.

Eildh Doyle will draw "the voice of the players" on the Scotish Ataltic board
Elidh Doyle was selected by the Scotish Ataltic Board as the director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a popular Scottish player and chairman Ian Beattie described this action as a good opportunity for those who guide sports to benefit from his extensive performance in sports involving other countries ten years ago.

Thank you for encouraging me with messages of encouragement! ’
Breast - pumping trade creates a division in the Internet
The pumping company has created a distilling of the Internet with a message that compares the breast milking mothers to the cows.
To mark the offer of what is said to be "the first sound - eared breast lung in the world," Elvie’s clothing company has issued a video - music advertising to show freedom for mothers who breast - feeding.
The four mothers sing a song in a cattle boat with the name "Yes, I am running, but you don't see the tail" and say, "If you didn't see this, my breasts are not my."
The course says: "Take it out, take it out, take it out, nurse the children, take it out, pick it out, pick it out, nurse my friends."
However, this advertisement, printed on the company’s Facebook page, created a controversy on the Internet.
This video with 77,000 who have seen hundreds of compartments, has received different views from viewers, when many say that it looks down on the "mainary" of the milk industry.
"The worst decision to use cattle to advertise the product.
As if they need to be pregnant and give birth to milk, unless their babies are taken within a few days of birth, says another.
The Elvie breast pump is hidden inside the breastbrush (Elvie/Mather)
Another said: "It’s a difficult situation for both mother and baby.
But why don't you use it to advertise a breast lung that mothers are able to keep their children?'
Another said: "This is not appropriate."
Some protected the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she had found a song "good sense."
"I think this is a good idea.
I would buy it if I were still breast - feeding.
Bathing somehow made me feel like a cow.
The message is too provocative but has come to realize what it means.
This product will be very useful, ” writes another.
Another has made a comment: "This ads laughs and refers to pumping mothers (usually at work or in private homes) and feel like "wild cattle."
This is not an advertisement that honors or judges a milk industry.
At the end of the video, a group of delegates indicated that they had been dancing with hidden pipes under their bra.
The motive of the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast - feeding claim to feel as if they were cattle.
But Elvie Pmp, with no sound, no ropes or tubes and is covered under the breastbrush, gives women freedom to move, take their children, and get them out of the lungs.
Ana Barin, the equivalent of ECD in Mother, has observed: "Elvie Pup is a product that will be a product that you will be most likely to fit the way to advertise it in a clear way.
By comparing women nursing to cattle, we wanted to put breastfeeding with all its challenges in the public, while it presented in a pleasant and understandable way the feeling of relief for the new lungs to bring.
This was not the first Elvie camp to be questioned.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children came from a catalk designer Martha Jambowski using this product.
Hundreds of New Homeless Children Safely Move to a Tent on the Texas border
The number of adopted children has risen even though it has not changed the monthly number of passersby on the border, partly because the hard - pressed police installed by the Trump office made it difficult to provide the children who do not respond.
Often, many advocates become defenseless immigrants, and they have been afraid to risk their chance to stay in this country by identifying themselves as a parent.
This risk became serious in June, when authorities announce that supporters and other adult members of the household will have to send fingers, and that the chart will be given to the foreign authorities.
Last week, Maththew Albence, chief of the Immmigation and Customs Environment, admitted before the Congreges that this court binds many people who have enrolled to support children who have no parents.
The court later admitted that 70 percent of those arrested had no crime.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who do not support or support family members are here illegally, and most of them are criminals.
So we continue looking for those people, ’ says Mr. Albence.
In an effort to improve children quickly, officials have introduced new laws that will require some of them to appear in court during the month, not after 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the shelter staff.
Many will appear on a video screen, not going literally, to ask for legal rights in a foreign court.
Those viewed as unworthy will soon be sent to exile.
If children stay in jail for long periods of time, they are more likely to be anxious or depressed, which may lead to a fight or to try to escape, in accordance with the shelder’s personnel and the reports released from the exercise months ago.
The lawyers say that this concern is growing at a much larger center like Tornillo, where the signs of a child’s strain may be ignored, because of the size of the area.
They also add that moving children to a tent town without taking time to prepare emotionally or to share with friends can create many problems that we already have.
Syria tells the US, French, and Turkish forces to turn away immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moueram spoke to the Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in his country is now his eighth year.
Moueram, who is also the vice president, said that foreign troops were in Syria illegally, that they would end terrorism, and "to be treated accordingly."
"He must go at once without the facts," tell the audience.
Mouleyam has maintained the "fighting against terrorism is about to end" in Syria, where more than 320,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "for this holy war and that it will cleanse the place of Syria" for terrorist groups and "anyone from another country."
The United States has about 2,000 military forces in Syria, focusing primarily on training and directing the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bar - Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in a war - torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moulem said that the circumstances allow them to return, and he blames the "Some western countries" for the fear of the refugees.
He said, "We have spoken to the international community and to the welfare of the people to make sure that the refugees return."
"They conduct politics on a matter that should be handled only by people's welfare."
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not help his Syria again until a political treaty was made between Assad and those opposed to the end of the war.
UN agents say that a newly formed treaty between Russia and Turkey to build a border on the last great Idib substructures of his Idib is an opportunity to proceed further with political discussions.
The Russian and Turkish treaty has prevented much of the fighting of Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moulem insisted that the treaty was "reserved for a clear time" and hopes that the soldiers would attack the rebels and the defenders of the Nustra Front connected with the Al-Qada, "that they will be destroyed."
UN ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon you will organize the first meetings of a new committee that includes the government and opposing members to have a written record after the Syrian war and to arrange for a choice.
Mouleram has set limits on the joining of the Syrian government on the committee, saying that the postal work should last "by observing the articles of the new constitution," and he warned against rushing.
Why will Trump be able to win the second choice
In that sense, Mr. Trump can win the second choice in 2020 unless, since there are many nonsmokers who may wish to be that, dishonest and do wrong that would replace him as president.
No doubt that will be the most significant conclusion in the president’s history!
So far, there is no sign that the audience has become bored.
Since 2014, CNN viewers have doubled to 1.5 million and MNNBC watch nearly three million.
The Fox News usually has 2.4 million viewers, ranging from 1.7 million in the last four years, according to NIelsen, and the MSNBC "Rachel Maddow Sow" is the lead of many three.5 million viewers in the hot night news.
"People are curious because we don't understand it," says Neal Baer, director of a ABC drama program called "Degread Survival," which is about the Cabinet secretary who became president after an attack on Capitol.

Why?
"He said, "Because you make me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
It is a delight to listen and watch these events.
Of course, unlike anything on TV, news from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, no matter whether the immigrant families are reunited and the global economic situation.
Few people are aware of these matters.
Also, it is more than that a knowledgeable citizen who finds himself seated more than six hours to watch the encyclopedia’s license in conflict with the use of Bob Woodward source "of the deep background" in his book "Fear," the leather leather of Paul Manafort costs $15,000 (" a heavy garment of pride, says The Washington Post) and the graphic description of Stormy Daniels.
As for me, I will never see Super Mario again.
"Some of the things he does make it seem that he is a major program for human life that is always giving something at night," says Brent Montgomery, director of the Wheel Interment and founder of the "Pawn Stars," speaking of the people in the Trump program and daily hot conversations (to contact with N.F.L.L., to commend Kim Jong-un).

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, it was about 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast called Kauai, but he was in the center of the MNNC and recorded the CNN.
It was unlikely that they would leave before him, as Brett Kabanaugh faced the Senadaciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is uncertain.
"I remember the past making all these stupid programs and saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," says Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was fun, but it seems they were right."

Large amounts of money are included in the age selection of the House race.
Not surprisingly, on the 17th of the 17th, there are huge sums of money, thanks to the restructuring of the lawn regions that have come out with two officers in the exchange for the same seat.
This newly painted Pitsburg district put him in a contest the Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat on another circuit in a special summer election last year.
Lamb still competes with another conference, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, now representing the old Pennsylvania region of 12, which reaches the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the older provinces broke the foundation by votes to the Republic.
The competition in this new 17s has led to a joint competition between members of the main team, the Democratic Campasural Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campand Committee (NC).
The name Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after winning a special option on March that was observed by many people of Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
That position had been occupied by the Republic for more than ten years, President Donald Trump won the valley with 20 pins.
The politicians gave the Democrats a measure of opportunity.
The U.S. considered punishable El Salvador by Supporting China, and Taken Back
Dominots have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama has long observed Beijing, with little appeal from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a free meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and they were in a hotel in Panama until they removed the Trump Organization's control team.
Government Department officials have decided to call again and again the American prelates of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama about the latest decision not to deal with Taiwan," Heather Nauert, commenting on the door, states at the beginning of this month.
But only El Salvador has been paid, with $140 million for helping America in 2017, and in controlling narctics, promoting and supporting economic development.
A fixed fee, which includes financial cuts and provided restrictions on the victims, could be painful to the Central American country because of the increasing unemployment and murder.
As their conventions progressed, North America and Central America reduced the high level of security and economy to follow the same gathering last year that was considered a step forward in the effort to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid - September, high administrative authorities made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively eliminating any idea of paying El Salvador.
President Mike Penence should now arrange to speak with the conference, now scheduled to be in the middle of October, as a sign to the authorities at this meeting, say the authorities.
And three American delegates returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without strong new orders or penalties from Washington.
The White House's Word of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two missionaries, who agreed to discuss inner intentions with the status of privacy.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external prosecutor next to the administrator and talked about the privacy condition.
A Lesson From History
The next point may be a special adviser to Robert Mueller’s special adviser by resisting the justice of Mr. Trump, and there is now a strong evidence on the public record.
Mr. Mueller is said to have examined whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was connected with Russia in its efforts to attack our choice.
If Congress change, Mr. Trump will find himself facing cases in this body, since he is preparing to stand before the voters, and perhaps finally before the court.
These are many issues, and I don’t say that Mr. Trump’s fall will be sure to happen either in Europe.
There are decisions all of us should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the race.
In 1938, German officials were eager to set up a coup d'ét against Hitler, as long as the West was against him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the bleeding years that followed.
History surrounds such situations, and persistent efforts to make ends meet have either become unsuccessful or even targets for years.
Americans now face many of these crises.
What will we do if Mr. Trump expels D-Aputorney General Rod Rosenstein, who controls Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the paper reported that last year, he offered to record the president secretly and mentioned his failure to do his work.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times story is wrong.
"How will we react if a new F.B.I.N. Brett Kananaugh’s inquiry is incomplete or unjust — or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite accusations of sexual abuse and lying?
And above all, will we vote it in the middle of Congress to make an accusation against Mr. Trump?
If we fail to do so, the personal will of the majority will not be fulfilled for a long time.
But I believe we will never fail, thanks to the study I had learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who had been exiled to Auschwitz for the same Nazi regime that once ruled the area where I was the representative.
She survived, moved to America, and, after 60 years, sent me to light candles on the Sabbath at a sathestic table.
With that as an inheritance, how can I be hopelessly optimistic about our future? ’

Graham Dorrans of Rangers hopes as the game draws closer to Rapid Vienna
Rangers play home with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that to win the Austrians, after playing equally in Spain and Villarreal before this month, will put them in a good position to pass through the Group G of the Eubal League.
Smiling on the knee prevents the sex player Graham Dorrans from playing for the first time in the grief until it is playing the equivalent of 2-2 to Villarreal but you believe that Rangers can use the results to look forward to larger things.
"It’s good to find out this point because Villarreal is a well - to - play group," says this 31 - year - old player.
"We're going to this game with the hope that we will come back with something and we will find a point.
We may have received a climb toward the end but, otherwise, a balanced game is also good.
They played better than we did on the first team, and with the second, they became a better player.
On Thursday, we play another European game.
We hope to get three points, but that will be a hard game because they played well in the past but, as our followers encourage us, I am confident of the outcome.
Last year the ordeal, during all the things that have happened with my injuries and changes in the organization itself but seems to be getting better now.
A team is good and enjoyable; it’s also enjoyable when it’s trained.
We hope that we will work now, past the tribulation that has passed away and be successful."
Women are unable to sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite having had a clear view of how they wanted to be cared for, few would talk to their families about it.
Nearly half the people in the United Nations report talking to their mates about the long - term cost of care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't take steps to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the welfare industry of National welfare insurance.
Let the account begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot arrange for your family to take care of you if you do not earlier.
Also, work with your counselor and your family to discuss how you will receive and how to care for them, since decisions can have a profound effect on how much money will be spent.
Tip your financial counselor: Your counselor can also help you to cope with your loss.
Your long - term decisions for care may include a long - term insurance plan, a life - insurance plan that makes it possible to pay for these expenses or to be a health insurance program once you have enough money.
Prepare your own constitution: Protect yourself from legal battles.
Find out the proprietor of health care to establish a trusted person to care for your treatment and to make sure that the doctors follow your wishes if you are not able to speak.
Also, consider the identity of antorney in your money.
You will choose someone you trust for your money and make sure that your expenses are paid when you can no longer do anything for you.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine your elderly parent is being rushed to a hospital emergency situation and rushed to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about his or her condition?
Make a list of such details so that you will be prepared for the situation.
"Not only money should be viewed, but who are doctors?" asked Martin.

Government’s prosecutors require an unusual death sentence for the alleged victim of terrorism at the NYC.
The prosecutors of New York wanted the death sentence of Syfillo Saipov, a New York City terrorist who killed eight people — an unusual sentence that has not been issued in this area on the crime court since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is said to have used Home Depot’s rented truck to attack on the way of the West Side Highway at Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and riding bicycle in that way by Oct.
In order to administer capital punishment, the persecutors will have to show that Saipov has killed eight people and "by choice" they have seriously injured them physically, in accordance with the notice of the death sentence, issued by the Southern District of New York.
Both acts carry the weight of capital punishment, in accord with the court’s law.
After some weeks, the question court imposed Saipov on 22 cases involving eight murder cases, which are often used by public prosecutors on organized crime cases, with a criminal case of violence and the destruction of cars.
The attack has required "to organize and think positively," says the persecutors, explaining how Saipov did it "wicked, cruel and shocking."
"Syfillo Habiblaevic Saipov is injured, killing the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angeli, Nicholas Callis, An-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Herriel Erlij, Hernan Ferrruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejorian Pargco," says the court judge.
Five killed have been visitors to Argentina.
Ten years have passed since New York’s Southern District ended up handling the death sentence.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with killing two drug users but ended up in prison for life in September 2009.
The last time the execution of the death sentence in New York was in 1953 in Julius and Queen Rosenberg, married persons who were executed after being convicted of placing information between the Soviet Union during the Cord War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has shown that he has no heart in the days and months following the attack, according to the court’s claims.
Tell the investigators that you feel good about what he has done, says the police.
Saipov tells the authorities that what has led to this attack is the viewing of ISIS on his phone, in line with his words on the side.
You have also asked that the IIS flag be hung in his hospital room, says the police.
He said he had no side on the side of the 2-pounders placed.
David Patton, a public defense representative of Saipov, says, "They are disappointed as expected" by a court decision.
"We think that the decision to seek a death sentence rather than accept a release from prison without a release will only be easy to be shocked in these cases for all concerned," says Patton.
The Saipov defense team had asked the persecutors not to accept the death penalty.

The Russian Grand Price: Lewis Hamilton nears to discover the earth’s purity after following the directions of the group that enabled him to conquer Sebastian Pettel
It became apparent when Valtlie Bottas succeeded in passing Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the instructions of the Mercedes band will play a major role in this contest.
From the beginning, Bottas started out well and probably argued with Hamilton as he defended his position on the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel entered first in pits and left Hamilton to stop cars in the gang, which should be a determining factor.
Mercedes entered the pit after the circle and was behind the Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead of the race, which made the Ferrari pilot forced to leave the inner side safely after two years of protection from the third crown.
Max Versapen starts in the rear line of the grid and became the seventh at the end of the first cycle on his birthday 21st.

It was a hard day because Valtlie did a good work all weekend and was kind to me.
The group did an admirable job of having 1 2," said Hamilton.
His Body’s Mover to Riches
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein’s conference as he insisted that he did not show a letter from Christine Blasey Ford to the Supreme Court’s lawyer Brett Kananough on sexual harassment charges.
Speaking to an organization in West Virginia, the president did not directly comment on the evidence presented by Ford before the Senate Council of Political Affairs, but he noted that what happened to the Senate showed that people were "unreasonable and disloyal."
"One thing that would have happened with something good that continued a few days ago in Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and unkind and inconsiderate, and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at broken news and say "oh, I haven’t done it.
I did not do it. ”
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feinstein, told someone?
You remember his answer... Is there someone who sent the cement - ‘ Oh, ’ or, what?
Oh, no.
I don't send anyone.'
Well, wait one minute.
We have sent him... No, we have not sent no one, ” he says, referring to the senator.
Feinstein was sent to a document with information about Kabanaugh’s trial by Ford back in July, and it appeared at the beginning of September - but Feinstein denied that the dok did come out of his office.
"I didn't hide the testimony of Dr. Ford, I did not send anyone," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"You have asked me to keep it a secret and to keep it as you have asked."
But his refusal did not meet with the president, who noted during the Saturday night session: "This is what I can say, his body movement is very wealthy.
He may not have done it, but the movement of his body is rich.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court, accused of three women of physical abuse, the president said that the Democrats resorted to their profits.
"He is willing to fight for sovereignty for whatever he may do.
You see a lack of kindness, indifference, not concerned about who it is, who should go through whom they should rule and control," reports the Mediae in the words of the president.

Paddington’s editors feared that the students would not like the printed document, revealed the newspaper
Bernd’s daughter Karen Jankel, born after the book was approved, said in a book: "It’s difficult to place it in the shoes of someone who reads it first before it is printed.
It is thrilling to know this now that we know about Paddington success.
He says that his father, who has worked in BBC as a photographer before being moved to write a child's book on a small toy bear, would not be discouraged if his work was not appreciated, he added 60th annover of his printing was "gally and happy" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, which he described as "the quality of our family," he added to his father’s standard of success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not proud," he told them.
"But because Paddingington was real to me, it was like if your child has accomplished something: you take pride in it even if it doesn’t work for you.
I think he viewed Paddington success that way.
Even if it was invented and thought of him, he always praised Paddington.
My daughter died and I had to telephone her
When her daughter is brought back to the Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, the doctors are working hard to save her life.
"Nad always called very bad, saying he didn't expect to survive," says Nkkz Edna-Lapehouse.

And I gave them a warm hug.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, you come.
I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.
I will be with you.
The prescriptions given to her to keep her heart beating gradually decreased and she was losing weight.
He died some time ago, and this was about to stop him.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I could not raise my voice or cry because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I really had to hold myself. ”

A woman types cards to prevent suicide in a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who commit suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys had picked up cards from the Welsh bridge with encouraging words and telephone numbers that people can use for help.
The son of Nkz Davis was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don’t want any parent to feel as I do every day," says Nks Davis.
Msz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a promising cook and that when everyone smiled, everyone was upset.
"All the people knew about his smile.
They kept saying that it was all right there.
Nevertheless, she quit her job before she died, since she was very depressed.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, became the first to find her after suicide.
Mrss Davis said: "I’m always worried that something is going to happen almost the same."
Mrss Davis began making cards, “to inform people that there are people to talk to, even if they can be friends.
Don’t suppress your feelings — you must talk.
Msz Humphreys, a former friend of Nkz Davies for many years, lost Mark, his 15 - year - old manager, just after his mother died.
"He didn’t say that he felt inferior or depressed or that he said something," he relates.
“ A few days before Christmas we noticed a different way of doing things.
He said that on Christmas Day he was a different way when the children opened their gifts without looking in the eye or doing something."
He said that his death was very stressful, but they had to face it: "A lot of space is opening up in the family.
It hurts us deeply.
But all of us must keep on fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is not guaranteed as the FBI begins a search
"I thought, if we could actually find something like the one he was looking for in a quick, easy - to - carry line, ” says Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would ‘ split in ’ since there were so many of the advocates.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want FBI to do research?
Time is the result of what they waste.
The middle choice will come to five weeks, November 6 - if, as it is supposedly, the Republiccans will fail, then they will be weakened in their efforts to find the highest court.
George W. Bush had been calling Senators, encouraging them to support Mr Kananaugh, who was working at the White House working for Mr Bush and where he met his wife Ashley, who was the secretary of Mr Bush.
What happens when FBI quits its report?
There will be a Sanate option, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get about 50 votes from the Senate, which will allow Mike Penence, the president's vice president, to divide him and bring him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean Fosters 'low' under Kim
The number of rebels in North Korea to South Korea has diminished since Kim Jong-un began ruling seven years ago, says a South Korean legal scholar.
The Park Ezeong-seg, which cites the details of the South joint door, says that last year there were 1,127 rebels - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park says that border laws have been strictly enforced between North Korea and China and the high costs required by underground immigration workers have had a serious effect.
Pyongs did not notice anything in society.
A large number of rebels from the Northern Hemisphere eventually receive the privileges of citizenship in South Korea.
The Seoul states that more than 30,000 people in North Korea have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled to China, with a long line connected to North Korea, and it is easier to fall there than the Demilialsed Zoe (DMZ) which has protection between two Koreans.
China views these traitors as illegal immigrants and often punishs them in their countries.
The relationship between North and South - South still war - still in some sense has progressed dramatically in the past months.
At the beginning of this month, leaders of these two countries met in Pyong - based Pyong to discuss mainly the establishment of nuclear disarmament.
This took place after the historic June meeting between the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jung-un in Singapore, when they agreed on several methods of working to eliminate nuclear weapons in Korea.
But on Saturday, the Northern Korean Foreign Officer R Yong-ho blames the US authorities for not taking action since then.
"Unless the US still trusts, there will be no hope for the safety of our country and under those circumstances, we will never close our own arms first," said Mr Ri in an address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "s control of emotions," saying that he is not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minor Leader Nancy Pelosi has called the one to be chosen by the Supreme Court Drett Kananaugh as "cons control of emotions" and said that her emotions also do not allow her to work in the Supreme Court.
Persis utters these words in a conversation on Saturday in the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I just thought that if a woman did this way, it would be called a ‘ emotional control, ’" said Pelosi with her reply to Kabanauh’s words before the Sanate Judea Committee on Thursday.
Kabanaugh has bitterly denied that he has shot Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at an early age.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh expressed emotions, some of which he lost while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also took note of the Democrats on the committee, called the charges against them the "information of human knowledge to be executed" intended for the public to blame that Hillary Clinton was cut off in the 2016 election.
Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh’s testimony points to failure in the Supreme Court, for it indicates that he is opposed to the Democratic.
"I think he makes himself unfit for those words and how he speaks about Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was rare when asked if he could try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was denied, and that Democrats received many seats from the House of Repreentaves.
"This is what I will say -- if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it means not only in the Supreme Court but also in your present court," says Pelos.
Kabanauh is now a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi has added that as Democrat she is concerned that Kavanaugh may judge against Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is thought to be the judge acting.
When questioned, Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he could answer some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to be an emotional person, who takes the side to the court and is expected to say, 'Until it was good,' says Pelos.
And Women Need to Exercise Their Power.
Proper criticism, months and years of fiery anger, and there is no other way to throw you away without weeping.
"We cry when we are angry," Nksz. Steinim told me that 45 years later.
"I don't think that is unusual, what do you say?"
He added, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a misfit, who said that she cried when she was upset, but he found out that when she was upset and she cried, she would say to the person who spoke to her, "You can think I’m sorry because I cry.
I’m angry. ’
Then he went on.
And I think that was fine. ’
Tears come to life as a way to let go of anger because they have a strong need for people.
One of my earliest memories, an office full of men, when I found myself crying out because of an unexplainable rage, was attracted by an insolence that I always feared to pull me to the stairs.
"Take care that you don't see you crying," she told me that.
"They don't know you are angry and angry.
They think that you are upset and will be happy because they have found you.
Patricia Schroeder, who became the Democratic comes from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when she entered the choice.
In 1887, when Mr. Hart was caught committing adultery in a vessel called Monkey Business and was released from election, Nkz. Schroeder, very angry, he realized that he could not fulfill his desire to make a choice as president.
"It was not a well - thought - out decision," she said to me when she laughed 30 years later.
"There were seven others in the competition, and the object of ridicule did not wait for another.
One calls it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was about to end, he had no money for the press, so he vowed he would not enter the race until he had $2 million.
It was a war that I could not win.
He found that some assistants who give him $1,000 to men could give him $250.
"Do they think I’m getting a break?" she wondered.
While he spoke out as saying that he would not perform an organized campaign, he was overwhelmed by the emotion of people who had supported him, the frustration of a plant that made it difficult to gather money and look for voters rather than for membership, and the resentment of the prejudices among women that have been caught in it.
"You would think I had entered," recalls Mrs. Schroeder and the way the news was reacted to him.
"You can imagine that Kleenex will be a coffee sponge.
What will they put in my grave?
"Are you weeping?""
How trade between the US and China can be beneficial in Beijing
The Salvos to open the trade between the US and China closed their ears, and as the war is far from over, the conflict between these countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the future, say experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, issued the first warning early this year by distributing goods sent to China as well as electric generators, steel, and alumenium.
The greatest trend in this check is the new tire affecting $,200 billion ($5, U.S.), and half of all goods enter from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in the same way, recently placing between 5 and 10 percent of American goods cost $60.
China has asked to be equal to the US Cwamash, and the second largest economy worldwide has little chance of falling soon.
To adjust Washington means to keep it in check with its requirements, but to bow to the US can be very embarrassing to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, researchers say that if Beijing acts wisely, the pressure to trade with the US can reap China for a long time by reducing the interaction of both assets.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that can cause economic problems in both countries are more dangerous than people who have seen it before," says Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'prescription' for the return of the refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready to return by willing return to refugees and seeking help to rebuild a war - ravaged country that lasted seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, foreign minister Walid al Moulem says that conditions in the world are improving.
"Today the situation is calm and safe because of the progress made in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to repair areas that have been damaged by terrorist attacks to restore normal lives.
All situations now permit the willing return of refugees to the country in which they had to flee because of terrorism and the oppressive economic laws that plagued their daily lives and way of life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled this country since the war began in 2010.
The rest of the six million people who still live in this area are in need of material assistance.
Al-Mouleam said that the kingdom of Syria would enjoy the help of rebuilding war - torn land.
But he emphasized that they would not accept help that was reasonable or assistance from nations that advocated rebellion.
