You have to bring them there.
Why is this so important?
Asa and my father.
Do not give up.
I am new here.
I’ll be in a bad mood.
We know what you are doing.
How Does Your Father Feel?
I know what they have to say.
Why don’t we go too far?
We’ll meet again!
Be quiet!
I don’t have a place to live.
You can.
Last year I gave birth to my first child.
I’m sure I’ve seen you some time ago.
You are a good person.
Where is your family located?
Better it would be if you didn’t.
I am not hungry.
I am a staunch university student.
I lost my keys.
We are not alone.
I want to know.
I would like to ask you, What are the benefits?
No one knew what should be done.
It made me think.
I’m one of your students.
Why not learn French?
Not necessarily.
I want to see you.
I’m glad you are there.
When Do You Grow Up?
Tom knows why?
At what time?
We have no money.
Be Forgiving!
I do not need them.
I told my parents everything.
There is no other way.
I know what to do.
I know where he is.
It is very good.
When it does not become cold, it is not simply dry.
I lost my purse.
When Do You Rise?
You can find any of the colors that you like.
All day long, he was gone forever.
They have no money.
You are a good parent.
Come or Come?
I want to cook for you.
Do you want to have a lot of money?
I lose my head.
If you do not, come with me.
He is my father.
I’m curious.
What is he short of understanding?
I don’t think he will.
I’m not sure.
They say that he is rich.
His Word was striking.
I don’t want to cook.
Do not do that again.
No one knows her well, except her parents.
I could do it.
I don’t think he will.
He rejected her.
The sun rises in the east.
Why not?
It will be very good.
It’s easy.
I remember that earlier.
Do you want to take them?
What is his name and purpose?
You act as if you were right.
My older brother is away from home.
My parents called me over to them.
What do they do here?
Do you have a brother?
See this picture.
I am confined to a wheelchair.
What are you able to do?
Is this your mother?
Why the blue sky?
If you do not, come with me.
This car is for us.
Nobody here has a car.
Choose for Us!
I don’t know the word.
The answer is obvious.
I’m glad you are there.
Are we?
Forget it!
What is the purpose of this object?
They don’t give me a chance.
My daughter is to be married on a sixth month.
I know these women.
I understand what you are saying.
It makes me happy.
Where do you know my name?
Which would you rather be?
Is It Love?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December is 12 months of the year.
I have a question.
I thought you were married.
Will You Walk With God?
Before him was a teacher.
I miss her terribly.
I was really rude!
Whose judgment do you think I am?
I’ve seen it in my own eyes.
You want to see it.
An oath is a sworn statement.
He is not with you.
I don’t like these people.
Do you need something to drink?
Are you happy?
Absolutely!
No one listened.
It seemed to me that it was all your fault.
Include a letter stating that the donation is conditional.
You did not come, do you?
He is coming!
Yes.
I don’t know how long.
Whose vessel is this?
May I come back?
Let him know!
No one knows what needs to be done.
Don’t look down.
I’ll have to ask him.
We returned.
I’ll look at you.
I know much about you.
It’s easy.
I want to learn French.
My car was wrecked.
You know I love you.
I know him.
Listen!
I know what to do.
I know what is going on.
He left his car key.
Why Are You Not Here?
Can I see it again?
Do you know how to separate the sheep from the goats?
You don’t know my brother.
I will take you to school.
Do I know Tom?
Do you feel that way?
May I come back?
And that makes me love you.
Are you one of them?
It’s going to be hot.
Please give me a piece of furniture.
On the contrary.
It’s hot.
You know I love you.
The bed is warm and warmed.
Our journey is urgent.
I accepted the money.
What would you like to see?
How do you go to school?
Are you a new person?
I know what to do.
Are you an avid learner?
Do You Have an Money?
I don’t know.
I know how to do that.
Which dot shows where we live?
I’m glad you are there.
This book is very interesting.
Thank you for taking the life of our home.
I respect them.
Wow!
He is powerful.
This is worth five dollars.
I returned home to Mother.
You are right.
Your furniture has been soiled.
I will fortify you.
Thank you very much.
Are you an avid learner?
May I give it to you.
Drink and relax.
I want something.
You are my friend.
Where Is Our Vehicle?
No one knows what needs to be done.
What is your school?
You don’t want to know!
He is a good student.
I often think about it.
Receive a copy of the book and read it.
I don’t have a home of my own.
Thank you very much.
I know you said.
I think about it.
He is happy.
I was hungry.
I’m not sure.
Do not do that.
I suppose you had returned home.
In time, my daughter will marry.
He was raised by his grandmother.
Let her tell you.
I want to go home.
They do not know.
I have a brother.
I quickly picked up the uniform.
How long will you continue to maintain it?
I leave home before eight o'clock in the morning.
I threw away my umbrella.
Why were they here?
What is love?
We are wise to understand.
I love this book.
Please read on.
She is a beloved wife.
I will be pleased with you.
It is up to us.
Where is your family located?
Do not say the same thing again.
Please, I’ll send you a copy.
Where are we going?
I don’t know how.
You know where I will be.
What is the purpose of your visit?
We are happy to see them.
I know that girl.
You stop the car.
I just don’t understand.
Do you know what to do?
We know it.
No, thank you.
Where would you like to live?
I love the place where I live.
Do not ask for help.
Should I open a window?
Wet water feet.
Where are you going?
Yet, you are very happy.
You have to go home.
Is he here?
Are you learning French?
You will be cordially sorry for what you have done.
Visits.
Where is my car?
I don’t know.
There I met my sister.
I know what I’m doing.
I gave the boy a copy of the book.
Who is your teacher?
I will do it for you.
This girl looks like a boy.
I don’t have a brother.
Sadly, a close friend of mine moved to another city.
Do they live in your home?
You know I have to go.
That’s your book.
It is not my day.
How long has he been sick?
If he had stayed home that day, it would have been safe.
Not only does he speak English but he also speaks German.
I’m not happy.
I know what is going on.
I know you know.
Better still, is it not?
I know what you think.
Greed.
It wasn’t enough, so I had to make some changes.
Better it would be if you didn’t.
This girl looks like a boy.
I like to watch you cook.
I have to clean my hair.
Too Little?
The owner is my brother.
I am happy to be happy.
Do you have time to help me?
Give them your support.
I don’t know his names.
Do You Know What Love Is?
The wedding will be on Saturday.
I would never die.
Tell me about your plans.
What is this book on the table?
I lost my purse.
Thank you for coming.
I’m a cook.
Someone is standing behind the wall.
I dropped out of school.
Well, do not give up.
Did you notice it?
Are they watching us?
Are you a good musician?
When I jumped out of the window, it was all gone.
Is he?
We found it.
They are children.
Do Not Be Afraid.
Do not forget to carry a letter.
I know that he loves me.
There is a need for being on the way.
I too am going to school here.
I don’t have a brother.
I'm even severely injured on my finger.
What do you see?
It will be embarrassing for you.
Do you know where he is?
Where is your Father?
Do not ask me again.
My father is at home.
Piercing is on the increase.
The Japanese?
Hand me a book.
You are a good person.
These windows close south.
I forgot to buy bread.
I will walk in the day of God.
We can.
Where do you come from?
Here we come to the crux of the matter.
I don’t know where he lives.
There is a hundred people in homes.
I understand that.
The plant has no teeth.
They were not.
My dream had come true.
You can get to know me.
I don’t know what to say...
Do you know where he is?
I am not a university student.
Let me see.
Are you with us?
Provide fine things in the sight of those needing it.
It’s not the same.
It is too small.
Assets do not work today.
We are so happy.
The girl is pretty.
Come and see me.
I am not the best carpenter.
I’m not sure.
Tell them what happened.
I suppose you had returned home.
I did it for you.
I love your car.
Who is your teacher?
Will You Be Back?
Does that prospect appeal to you?
It is enough.
Undoubtedly.
Would I like one?
I don’t know.
I’m glad you are there.
I need to feel frustrated.
I have left you.
Do not resort to additives, or tests, to different conclusions.
I don’t know what to think about.
I do not know what to do.
What motivates people to do so?
Where am I?
Do you know his name?
Money has been lost.
I want to buy a car.
I want to go too.
They don’t.
At what time?
We are convinced.
I could not believe my eyes!
I lost my keys.
I don’t know the word anymore.
I did not know it at this time.
I’m looking for you.
“ You see, ” he said, “this house is my house.
Your car is a good one.
They say that he is rich.
No one can be certain.
Will You Walk With God?
We don’t go.
In the past, there was a temple here.
I know you said.
Oh, yes.
Why not go home?
Is that how you feel?
They don’t give me a chance.
What would you like to see?
Why Do You Ask?
He is coming!
They don’t think I’m happy.
I believe he is quite strong.
Get what you want.
I know that girl.
It did not die.
You are a good parent.
Do you need a car?
I don’t have any money.
Do your homework.
I want to follow you.
I know only his name.
Asa and his mother.
I will really keep fast hold of you with my right hand of righteousness.
We understand that.
What is the condition of the family?
I speak some Spanish.
Next!
How old?
I have to know why.
He is not our brother.
My family is young.
Tom knows why?
Is he at home?
I love mathematics.
I know what to do.
It’s not the same.
Nothing happened.
We see each other.
Of course not!
Where is Tom?
Do not be afraid.
Where did you get it?
I do not know much French.
When do you go?
They have no money.
Tell them what happened.
What is this phone number?
Don’t stop.
It is not French.
Stop talking to me!
Sooner or later.
They saw him.
Efficient travel?
I did not know it at this time.
He nodded and nods.
Are you with us?
It is not presumptuous or proud.
Come up!
I love this car.
I know where to turn.
Yours is like your A.
How much is enough?
They take it one step at a time.
Not at all!
Where would you like to live?
See.
No one really listened.
Do not forget to carry a letter.
We are here for your sake.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
Take your shoes out of the house.
They know us.
When Do You Rise?
I will not give up.
Later in Britain.
You act as if you were right.
Let me explain.
Windows opened.
You do not have to come.
No one listened.
I have never forgotten that.
I don’t think he will.
It’s easy.
This is made of rice.
I know.
No one did.
They want us to do so.
What do you see on the outside?
I hope you will really enjoy it.
I’m not sure.
Where is Tom?
This is French.
The owner of the books is my sister.
We can work together tomorrow.
We arrived.
At home, I studied French.
Thank you for listening.
I know where they’re going.
It is a marvel of creation.
Our luggage is down.
I know your father.
At school, I studied French.
You have to go home.
Where did all people go?
Can You Open a window?
Will you go through the summer?
Where is my mother?
If so, when?
The same is true of you.
Where is your car?
I was not at home with my father.
There is no question about that.
Do you know what it is?
I am not disappointed.
Are you looking for them here?
There are no wealthy people here.
In this case, however, something far more serious was involved.
You know him.
I would love to see her.
My father was away.
Ah, but for how long?
What’s a phone call?
You can sing.
Be deeply sorry for me!
I know how to do it.
We are hungry.
I thought you could easily understand them.
Where are we here?
Love ceases to exist.
I’ll check it out.
I know you have.
I am not a student.
I’ll try it.
The winds are powerful, and I cannot move away.
Probably not.
There I saw my sister.
I do not give up.
How long will it stay there?
Asa and his father.
What is that?
It is followed.
My house is near the church.
He proved unfaithful!
All apples that fall down will be eaten by pigs.
I could not look.
I don’t want to read them.
No one knows her name.
Do you know where they were?
Where do you go to school?
Where are you going?
What a thought!
He gave them to me.
I shall not find you.
And where is he?
We listened.
Why do people say that?
Tattoos have great value.
I have a sworn oath.
I do not understand French.
No one!
Why do I have to do it?
Saturday.
So I did that.
I’m a cook.
How many?
We have no money.
I know that you listen to me.
Stack your shoes.
I know your appearance.
I was excited.
Is this a new car?
Why not?
He did not read the book to himself.
I do not want to be rich.
I’m sorry you said that.
An ant does not have teeth.
This will be a cause for rejoicing.
You can attend.
When Do You Come Home?
He did not read the book to himself.
You have to get up.
We love you.
This book is a new one.
You know him.
She is a French elder.
I don’t have a car.
Care for your head.
Why not make it your aim to do so?
I want you to see her.
You can use this car.
No, I didn’t.
I am a teacher.
I love him.
I am not a student.
Would you like to see this?
Stop saying that!
I love you.
He came alone.
I bought eggs and milk.
One plate is missing.
I saw him again.
Is this your mother?
We grew up together.
What was your purpose?
Are you looking for us?
I will be in my car.
I don’t like running.
She is a French elder.
He is a tall boy.
I know who they are.
You know how to do it very well.
I have a car.
When Will You Come Home?
In the evening, from 6: 00 a.m. to 8: 00 a.m., it is a time of rejoicing.
You do not have to come.
You have to stop drinking.
Take your mother’s care.
There is a need for being on the way.
Where did you end up on the road?
I will call between one hour and two hour.
If you have gas in your mouth, kill him.
Should I wear a badge or a do - it - yourself garment?
What book is this?
The Americans?
What does it look like?
Stop talking to me!
I’m reading a book.
Read!
I don’t know.
It is not as you think.
Would we find it?
Where Are Your Things?
Was an error?
Drink.
He is coming!
Can't End It All
I will fortify you, yes, I will help you, I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.
We are happy.
Keep cool.
It doesn’t matter.
I take them.
I am not hungry.
I understand.
Not really.
At school, I studied French.
Why?
I want to go home.
Asa and his mother.
Do You Want Me?
Let your mother do it.
You know I have to go.
Where is the car?
Do you love him?
We must place a limit between output and logs.
The serpent swallowed up the dove.
They are not coming today.
Do You Know What You Are Asking?
Open a window!
That’s where we are!
The boy is a relative.
Why didn’t you go to school?
Why not go home?
Can I get in?
You know I love you.
Research has been found on human bones in a cave.
Our journey depends on time.
Can I see it again?
These steps can prevent the spread of infection.
I am a factor.
We are told to eat a meal together.
Do not be provoked!
This is not an invitation to talk. We only go to a movie.
I liked him.
Why don’t we go home?
Get out of my room!
I am new here.
I want to learn French.
I am coming to find you.
I don’t have a sister.
I don’t sleep on the floor.
I have a purse.
The water is very, very hard.
If only I had known there were more.
I talk about what I think.
What was the price?
I know where we are.
Why not?
I am going to bring my car.
Why are you not in class?
We are in college.
I do not know his name.
My emotions are stirred.
How do you go to school?
Be Forgiving!
Not at all.
Do not hold back!
Do you know what it is?
I’m sorry you said that.
I know her family.
I know.
I lost my keys.
I’m not sure.
They don’t give me a chance.
What is the reason for your trip?
Why not?
She doesn’t speak English.
I ate eggs the next day.
Yes, is it?
We know.
I want a little relaxation.
No one did.
We are hungry.
I was devastated.
I talked to my parents about everything.
I wake up at 7: 00 a.m.
Keep the window open.
Come home.
Why not?
Why is it hot?
Every day, they set out on foot for the work except for the rain.
It is up to us.
Do not look below.
How does she feel about her sister?
Can we settle our differences amicably?
Where are you taking us?
I liked that car.
Why learn French?
I think so.
I’ve seen them.
I know who they are.
He accused the man of stealing.
So I made the clothes on my back.
I will not listen to you.
“ I do not know their names.
Share your thoughts with me.
I know what to do.
They say that he is rich.
Your furniture has been soiled.
You are Germans, are you not?
Do you love them?
"These trucks are more than more?" – "Yes, Father."
You do not need to thank me.
The next evening, what happened to your sister?
We want it to be a part of our lives.
Asa and his mother.
Since we are alone, let us enjoy life.
We visited you.
Which would you rather be?
It’s not my car.
I do not know his name.
Do you need something to drink?
Do you not know what has happened?
I know what love is.
Not at all.
The hawk aborts its attack.
What do you do here?
I am a factor.
Nobody prepared me.
We attended a one - school class.
Where did you come from?
It made me think.
Do you have some rice?
Is he here?
We meet.
Our siblings.
I know why you are here.
Why did you study at a university?
And where is he?
Sooner or later.
When Will You Be Back?
I've broken it now.
Thankfully, the answer is yes.
Listen to your mother!
Read what these people have to say.
May I give it to you.
What is it?
They are in my room!
A cup of tea?
Do you need something to drink?
I am the youngest.
How much is enough?
Would you like to read this book?
From Brazil.
I will take you home.
We attended a one - school class.
Do Not Forget Us!
I’ll write about it for us.
Do not give out small amounts of money.
Do you have the money?
It is too small.
It is his work.
That is what you have asked.
She’s my sister.
What do you want?
Do You Find Joy in the Disciple - Making Work?
He rejected her.
I want to see.
Stop laying down the law!
Sometimes we go to a movie together.
Is that not so?
Have you read this book?
Where are we?
Why do we do that?
This is extremely long.
Do you believe that it does not matter to me?
Covers are on the bottom.
She’s my sister.
It is his work.
Do you know what they said?
I’m not sure.
They do not know.
He is from the United States?
A cup or a cup of tea?
What was happening below?
I am sorry to say that I lost that position.
We are on our own.
I love what I do.
My voice gets numb because of my poor hearing.
Do you know what he said?
His words were, in effect, sweet.
When do you want to go?
I don't understand such things.
Is that the best?
From Japan?
I’ll try.
Does he know that you love him?
We are wasting valuable time.
Why not quit?
Look for an appropriate dictionary in other languages.
Where is his family located?
Magdalena and Vania make good friends.
I am happy to be happy.
We should eat at least one meal together.
Take one step at a time.
Do you have a brother?
We made up.
I’ll agree with that.
I have to think about it.
Where is Mary?
I feel like giving up.
I have to keep it.
I’m glad you are there.
Are they happy?
Why didn’t you come with me?
No one is at home.
I’m not sure.
He loved her.
She did not become pregnant.
Why Don’t They Love Me?
How Much Is a Parent?
What did you give me?
Look outside.
Tom is a carpenter.
I am not a wealthy man.
His face is intense; the brow is furrowed in concentration.
They were not.
The race!
I’ll take part in it.
How many nights?
We will succeed.
A smile came over me.
You have to go home.
Asa and his father.
You are invited to come along.
Do you know where he lives?
I was not happy.
Why don’t you come with me?
Give me your hour.
Do you have my money?
The sight is breathtakingly beautiful.
I suppose you had returned home.
I don’t have a brother.
I don’t know.
I don’t know how to keep my name.
Can You Recall?
I preach it.
Do you know these people?
Which right would you rather be?
Why do I do it?
I will not come near you.
This factory makes automated devices.
I am not a student.
Thankfully, the answer is yes.
Do not do that again.
Look in the window.
I was not happy.
One plate is missing.
He earns money.
He is happy.
Rickshaw Anyone.
Would you like to know why?
Would you like to find them?
Remember, though, your kindness is not limited to others.
I am the youngest.
What do you think?
We love to give talks in the language.
So did you come here?
I’m not sure.
I did.
No one said a word.
Our siblings.
It’s hot.
So I did that.
I have to learn.
Thank you very much!
It is his responsibility.
Does that prospect appeal to you?
You're our friend.
What was that purpose?
I no longer have any neighbor.
We are in college.
Nothing new.
Do you know someone who is struggling to escape death?
Why not review what you have said?
Nothing could be further from the truth.
I’ll try.
I would like to ask you, are you going along?
I know that girl.
What kinds of books do you like to read?
He or she needs water.
Where have you been?
It’s easy.
It makes me happy.
How many cups of coffee are you drinking?
Which office is that?
This car is a magnificent one.
We hear it.
Our luggage was down.
We shall see.
Your news?
I know you have.
I’m sorry you say that.
Children too.
I am a teacher.
We ascended a path that took us to the brow of a hill.
Name has been changed.
Do you want to be rich?
I want to read this book.
I never lie.
I am a university student.
They are for our own good.
They do not want us to know.
It’s not my car.
You are visible by red light.
I know what I am learning.
I miss you very much.
I understand what you are saying.
I want you to stay.
We walk together.
Give the opportunity.
I am not strong.
No one!
It is not a cause for rejoicing.
Can you understand French?
He makes me think.
On the contrary.
Who is this wine?
I have a brother.
It does not take much time.
“ If you need help, call me.
I.
We got out.
They are not wealthy here.
Why does he want to do so?
Listen to your mother!
I love mathematics.
He is coming!
We go there together.
We will be back in the following week.
I like to watch your cooking.
What do you do?
I shall lack nothing.
Did they?
He knows that we love you.
You can separate the sheep from the goats.
I’ll have to think about that.
No one really listened.
I love learning French.
We may take them along the coast this seventh end.
Why?
You did not come, do you?
You have to go home.
How old is he?
I know you.
Can't End It All
He does not seem to be happy.
I know where to turn.
Every day, they set off on foot for work, only to find that it was raining down.
Thank you very much!
I don’t want to quit.
What was happening below?
I’ll see a movie.
They look good.
I’m reading a book.
Do you know who owns this car?
I shall lack nothing.
You are a good student.
Forget that.
I am sure that I saw her again in a different location.
Do You Have a Time?
I love short - haired hair.
Do you plan to attend a meeting?
A cup of tea was running high.
Materials.
Yes.
