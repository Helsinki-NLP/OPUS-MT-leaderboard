The event of the rapid growth of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
An increasing event on the conditions of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) shows similar views in European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom to ensure that, although it is in different parts of the world, the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly progressing in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and emergency - care units should increase the willingness to accept many COVID - 19 patients who will need health care, and especially care for those in crisis.
On 31 December 2019, a group of people with unidentified etology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of the new coronavirus is now called the disease respiration syndrome coronatory 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the resulting disease of SARS-COV-2 has been named coronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence up to now indicates that 80% of the cases of COVID-19 are of minor cases, that is, respiratory disease that is accompanied by a vascular disease, and most of these people are recovering.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 is developing into the most serious illness that requires hospitalization while 6% of the remaining conditions are facing serious health problems requiring attention.
The deaths of the victims of COVID-19 are 4%.
In this study, we examine the accounts of the growing COVID-19 events in each European Union/European Economic Aria (EU/EA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those in the Hubei Province, China.
It also compared the current number of people with COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 was widely distributed in areas as well as the changing of the COVID-19 global epidemic is now following what is happening in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization General (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is a scourge.
The 5 March Council ofurosurveillance 2020, Spipiri et al. reported the first confirmed COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with WHO's definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first assured people reported to France on January 24, 2020 from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
By March 15, 2020, COVID-19 people had been found in all 30 countries of the EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom (UK), that between 31 December 2019 and that day, 39,768 persons with the virus and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750 infected with the virus and 1,441 dead were reported only in Italy.
To obtain the increasing number and increasing cases of COVID conditions
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), statistics for people with COVID-19 in each country worldwide, obtained only by legal sources such as the Department of Health for each country, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are reconvened each day by 8.00 a.m.
This data was used to analyze the COVID-19 EU/EEEA and UK, and compared with those in Italy.
As a representative of the development of the ongoing COVID-19 conditions, we calculate an ongoing period of 14 days of COVID conditions, thus considering the natural progress of COVID-19, in each country of the EU/EA and UK, during the period of 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also introduce an increasing number of reported cases for each country on 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared with Italy during the 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK
The growing age limit of 14 days of COVID conditions in EU/EEA and UK countries usually follow those of the Hubei Province (China).
All over the EU/EEA and the UK, the growing event of the COVID-19 began to rise on about 21 February and be very happy on 28 February 2020.
This is greatly increased by the rapid increase in the number of reported conditions from Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries show the same high levels of the developing COVID-19 event.
Figure 2 shows the increasing number of conditions of COVID-19, in EU/EEA and UK countries compared with that of Italy in the January 31,–15 March 2020.
Significantly, by March 15, March 8:00 a.m., some 15 EU/EEA and UK countries had already reported a total of less than that of Italian within 3 weeks before or less.
Our results show that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and UK.
The calendars marked on the growing problem of COVID-19 show that the epidemic is continuing at the same rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that the countries are divided, varied in the way of public health issues, and likely different explanations of conditions in countries as well as various protocols to select patients for diagnosis of COVID-19, which includes follow-up tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian provinces described the situation when 10% of COVID-19 patients needed care and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these provinces had reached their highest level.
The data for the COVID-19 hospital and/or care unit is found in the EU/EEA section only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (dadata not shown).
It should, however, be gathered in an orderly way to fit the current alert chart that focuses on the number of reported conditions and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a great difference in the availability of quality beds and of central care in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds in the Portuguese community.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 bed care and community care of 100,000 people in 2010–11).
To copy conditions related to the abundance of health care, which provides the average of each EU/EEEA and UK national population in regard to the increase of conditions in the hospital due to COVID-19 risk to the risk of over-defension of emergency beds, is provided in the sixth return for a brief study of the ECDCD-19.
Since conditions are accumulated in certain regions in the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and units of care usually help some people in the region, information about the circumstances and care facilities should be obtained at the rate of the Non-TWDS-2).
The experience of Italy and the current international satellites shows that the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly growing in the EU/EEA and UK.
The countries, hospitals and units of serious care should arrange for the ongoing interaction of SARS-COV-2 and the increase of COVID-19 patients who need medical attention, and especially serious care, such as that in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in a recent ECDC study of an immediate danger, a quick, active, and thorough method is important to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, by making changes from control system to a reduced course, since the expected rapid increase in the number of conditions may not provide the decisionmakers and hospitals with sufficient time for understanding, acceptance and adapting their response to their response as it is not possible to be used in the future.
A rapid risk check also means public health measures to control the effect of the epidemic.
There is a small gap in which the nations may not have the opportunity to further control their efforts to reduce the progress of SARS-CV-2 and reduce stress in health care.
Failure of this, some EU/EEA clinics are likely to be faced by a host of patients who need attention in the days to come or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a sere acute respiration syndrome (SARS) connavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), currently kills more than 3,000 people and afflicts more than 880,000 people in China and other parts of the world, which has succeeded in human disaster.
Like its same virus, SARS-COV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 has a more serious risk and mortality rate than SARS but is more widely passed and is treating more adults than are new and more males than women.
As a means of responding to the rapidly growing number of publications on the subject of a new disease, this article is trying to offer a timely and detailed review on the subject of rapid research.
We will discuss the basic things concerning epidemiology, biology, biology, diagnosis, treatment, cause, and prevention of disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help us to understand and be able to bring an end to the fear - inspiring disease.
The September 25, 2020, Spring Festival has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who are encouraged to stay in their homes on vacation and many weeks later because of the outbreak of the new virus.
The virus is much the same as the coronavirus (Cov) that caused the outbreak of a respiration of a respiration syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, it was named SARS-CV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named COV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and about 50 others around the world.
On March 2, 2020, the virus led to more than 80,000 assured conditions of COVID-19, with over 40,000 patients released from the hospital and more than 3,000 patients who died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "a leading public enemy" and is probably more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https:/www.www.nlm.nnih.gov/pubbmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 pages were printed regarding COVID-19 involving itsviology, epidemiology, etiology, treatment, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020.
This review is trying to cement the progress of research on the new and rapidly progressing subject.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by COV, Middle East respiration syndrome (MERS, 2012).
We will also consider what we have learned so far about prevention and the cause of sickness and other yet more important questions.
COVs generally viewed as noninfictions, primarily responsible for 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have had two major pathogenics, namely, SARC-COV and MERS-COV, which caused the epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, in sequence, and soon spread to other countries that caused serious illness and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third rise of the COV in written human history.
As indicated at Death.1.1.1, the idemonies with unknown origin began to be reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 in China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the COV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death event was reported in Wuhan.
In the meantime, the plague spread rapidly into neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, an influx of health workers was reported, suggesting that human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was disbanded and all public transport equipment was established.
On January 24 a study of the first treatment of disease reported that, of the 41 patients whose condition is confirmed, only 21 had direct contact with Wuhan’s Wuhan’s food market, which was considered to be the first place of disease from the unknown source of the animal.
On January 30, WHO announced the outbreak of a global health emergency.
By the time of the report, the disease had spread throughout China and about 50 countries around the world (Death.2).
As the situation changes rapidly, the end and tragedy of the epidemic are not known.
On February 11, 2020, a study of 8,86, which consisted of 4,021 confirmed that they were suffering from COVID-19 showed a more modified picture of the epidemic in the following way (https: //m. weg.ixin.q.com/s/Ulbi-HX_HPXA1HA2bdA).
SARS-COV-2 has caused disease for people of all ages, but mainly 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50, fewer than 20, and only 14 patients were less than 10.
SARS-COV-2 has caused more male illnesses (0.1/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 grew in groups primarily in and around the Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 days (2-9) from the beginning to the test.
The average period of the search period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from beginning to death is 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic remuneration number (R00) was 3.77 (95% CH: 3.51-4.55), and R0 modified was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people involved increased rapidly before 23 Jan. 2020, which was comparable to the time of the big move before the Spring Festival in China.
The death of confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% ICI: 1,101.86%), and the changed death rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% ICI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main factors of the risk of COVID-19 were sex (the men), age (%0260), and critical pneumonia.
COVs are part of a family of large, hidden viruses that contain a single RNA fibers.
It can be divided into four parts, namely, Alpha, beta, gamma, and Deltas, which are not known to affect people.
The spike (S) of the glycoprotein envelope adheres to the acceptance of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and input processors 4 (DPP4) for SARC-COV and MERS-COV, in sequence, then happens to be mixed in a fluid.
The RNA gene is released from the cytolipsm; after the return of the gene, the RNA of a gene that is associated with the glycoprotein and nucleopsid proteins form cells that contain a vioons, including the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The sequence of early SARS-COV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-COV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-COV with 99.98% of the 10 successive samples gathered at the first stage of the movement, the Huananan Sead Market in Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is usually much the same as SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
Using electron transmission microcopy, SARS-COV-2 crystals were found in the most visible parts of the epithelium for human thim.
The ACE2 people were found to be the SARS-COV-2 distribution and SARS-COV.
However, S S S S-COV-2 include a human ACE2 much faster than that of SARC-COV, which is in accordance with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes less serious transmission to patients than SARS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 can also build a new short protein produced by an organ3b and a output protein produced by an orf8.
The SAR3b of SAS-CV-2 may play a role in the bug-pounderity and may prevent the appearance of IFN®; however, nor does nor contain any known background or systemif.
On February 18, 2020, the Zhou, etl., reported a cylo-EM for people with full height of 2.9 Å associated with the amino acid vehicle B0AT1.
It was found that this combination, which consists of open and closed buildings, was combined as the DImer and the ACE2-B00AT1 link is able to combine two S proteins, which provides evidence of the appearance of CV and input.
B00AT1 may be a medical course in dispersal to stress the SARS-COV-2 input.
The origin and nature of the central layer
It is known that both SARS-COV and MERS-COV began in small bats and passed on to the people with civet cats and camels, respectively.
By comparison of SARS-CV-2 and other COVs, bats are recognized as the source of SARS-COV-2 as the new virus is 96% of the SARS-CVX45 bat and SL-CVZX1.
However, what chemical intervention helped the virus to cross the existing border between creatures so that it can infect humans is not known, and the channel of transmission will still be cleared up.
Ji, et al., suggested that the snakes may be a carrier of the virus from bats to humans that involved the recombination of the same elements inside the S protein.
According to research, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggest that gangolin - with a long nose, nitrate mammals commonly used as traditional Chinese medicine - may be the central component of SARS-COV-2 based on the 99% genetic components of COV found in pangolis and SARS-COV-2.
However, the 1% variation spread between the two genes makes a big difference; therefore, the assured results of a strong femaleity are left - handed. (Death.33)
SARS-COV-2 chemical elements are currently unknown.
SARS-COV and MERS-COV can live without a creature up to 48 hours in a dry area and up to 5 days under 20 degrees C and 40-50%.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar features.
It is reported that SARS-COV-2 is not associated with ultraviolet rays and 56 °C temperatures for 30 minutes; ether, 75% of ethanol, a chlorinic antibiotic, percetic acid, chloroplastic, and other fuels, but not chlorhexide, can cause the virus to work effectively.
All too often there is a lack of defenses against SARS-COV-2 and therefore is in danger of developing a new virus.
In the meantime, no detailed research has been reported on the response of the immune system to SARS-COV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to the previous studies of some COVs, especially the SAFS-COV and MERS-COV (Death.4).
Often, after the virus has infected the body, it is first identified by natural immune agents by the sensors (PRR) that include receptors like C cectins, receptor like Toll (TLR), receptor (NOD), and receptor similar to NOD (NLR).
By various means, the virus causes the display of the symptoms of diarrhea, the development of endritic cells, and the production of interferrons I (IFNs) that inherit the spread of the virus and speed up the macrophage pacocytosis of the antigens.
However, the N N SARS-COV protocol may help the virus to escape the reactions of the immune system.
Soon, the immune system’s adaptable response joins in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes that combine the T cells of the CD4+ and CD8+ play an important role in protecting.
CD4+ T cells encourage B cells to produce immune defenses, and CD8+ T cells directly kill infected cells.
T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, the CV can prevent T cell operation by producing an apoptosis of T cells.
Humor incompetence including such aids as C3a and C5a and immune systems are also important in the fight against infection.
For example, immune systems derived from a patient make MERS-COV ineffective.
On the other hand, over - the - counter reactions of the body’s immune system creates a large number of medical drugs in an area that can cause significant damage to the lungs and other body organs, and, in the worst of all, the failure of most organs and even death.
SARS-COV-2, with the first element as a group, is more likely to cause illness for older comorbidies and pregnant women.
It is not unusual for individuals who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have a immune system at risk to be infected, with higher risk of infection than other people.
The reason for the period of SARS-COV-2 is 1-14 days, most times 3-7 days based on the study of the first 425 persons in Wuhan.
However, surveys of 1,099 people show that the period of dating was 3 days on average and had a width of from 0 to 24 days.
Recent research, as described above, indicated that the dating period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on the knowledge of 8,866 people.
It is very important for health authorities to change the privacy of the period based on the correct diagnosis and to prevent infected people from passing the virus on to others.
As is the custom, people who are injured, or infected, need to be shut up for 14 days.
Should the curfew be extended into 24 days?
The fever is often the first major symptom of COVID-19, which may not be associated with symptoms or other symptoms such as no coughs, breath loss, muscle pain, pain, headaches, sore throat, thyroid pain, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In extreme cases, patients progressed rapidly and developed serious respiratory infections, sptic shock, metabolic acidosis, and cogagapoatethy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fevers, even though no unusual substances are seen in the colon image, should be prediagnosed for early tests.
A social information study conducted at the end of December of the 1920 ’ s showed the percentage of symptoms that were 98% of fever, 76% of non-inflammatory coughs, 55% of dyspania, and 3% of diarrhea; 8% needed to breathe with the aid of a machine.
Similar findings were reported on in two recent studies of a family group as well as a group based on a person’s having no symptoms.
By comparison, a study of human knowledge in 2012 indicated that ERS-COV patients also had a fever (98%), non-transformed coughs (47%), and dyspania (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed to breathe with the aid of a machine, much more than the cases with COVID-19 and in accordance with the highest rate of MERS murder than the COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and pain throat (21%) were also noted in MERS patients.
For SARS patients, it was shown that fever (99-100%), no cough (29-75%), dyspania (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were major symptoms and breathing with machine help was required of about 14%-20%.
On February 14, the deaths caused by COVID-19 were 2% in which the confirmed patients reached 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, the deaths caused by SARS in November 2002 were 10% of all reported cases.
In the MERS, based on human information research in June 2012, death was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
The first survey reported that R0 of SARS-CV-2 was higher by 6.47 had a 95-century division (CI) of 5.71-7.23, where R0 of SARS-COV was from 2 to 4.
SARS-COV-2 comparison with MERS-COV and SARA-COV concerning their symptoms, death, and R0 represents the Table1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-COV-2 is much higher in rate than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but it has a less deadly capacity than both.
Therefore, it is far more challenging to manage the SARC-COV-2 epidemic than MERS-COV and SARC-COV.
The start of a chain is usually at the same family or at the same gathering or a similar transportation device that is similar to the boat.
Patients usually have a history of visiting or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with individuals or patients two weeks earlier.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for as long as two weeks and that hospital - run patients can also carry the virus, which gives warning of increasing privacy.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells of peripheral (especially lymphocytes) in the first stages.
For example, white - celled lymphopiania is < 4×109/L including the number of lymphocytes < 1×109/L, along with high levels of apartate aminotranspherase and aviremia found in 1,099 with COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and veins and myoglobin were higher in the blood of some patients, and C-reacticive proteins and erthrocyte code were higher in the blood of many patients.
For seriously ill patients, D-dier level, the amount of fiber loss in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes had dropped dramatically.
An unusual discovery was in the chest of a number of COVID-19 patients and consisted of a double-clicked group or group of glaspality in the lungs.
Patients often suffer from extraordinary pneumonia, serious lung damage, and acupitory stress disorder (ARDS).
When ASS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, buildup of fluids, and progressive fibrosis are endangered by gas exchanges.
Disability of type I and I-type Pneumocyte reduces the rate of surfarfaract and increases the stress of the upper area, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to extend and increase the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the worst effects of radioography are often similar to the most serious condition of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first COVID - 19 for biopsy showed the appearance of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes, and the achievement of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as the discovery of multinized hyncial cells in the lungs of the patient, which is accompanied by a biopsy theory and ARDS and similar to that of SARDS and MERS patients.
The RNA discovery of SARS-CV-2 using verb-transscriptse polymerase (RT-PCR) was used as the main subject of COVID-19 evaluation.
However, because of the high number of non-invasive poisons, which may speed up the epidemic, medical evidence was introduced when tests (not only on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation developed when SARS was diagnosed.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, medical evidence, laboratory tests, and radar results is important and vital to successful diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Fong Zhang team described a CARLOCK program based on the CRISR to locate SARS-COV-2, which finds non-human RNA sections of SARS-CV-2 in 20 × 10-18 mol/2 to × 10-18 mol/18 mol/L (10-100 copies for each installed micrometer) is used for a time without complex equipment.
It is hoped that the new method will greatly improve sympathy and benefit if it is sure of medical samples.
Because of a lack of experience with a new COVID, doctors may primarily be able to provide support for COVID-19 patients, while trying various types of previously used or developed medical methods to treat other ComVs such as SAARD-COV and MERS-CV and other diseases (Tabla2).2).
This treatment includes current and possibly antimicrobial, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from patients, Chinese medicine, and mental help.
It is even recommended that blood plasma of patients be used as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical firms compete to develop antibodies and antimicrobial goals.
SARS-COV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably again, to a small degree, other body organs that show ACE2, such as a gastroids and kidneys.
Nevertheless, poor working conditions and respiratory failure pose a serious threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Therefore, the support for breathing is important to treat the symptoms and save the health and include conventional health care, high oxygen flow, air-cushion, and air-conservation, with the use of the body's emergency.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be based on the use of extracorporial membrane oxygen (ECMO), an improved surgical procedure used to treat heart failure or life - threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, the preservation of the integrity of an electrolyte certificate, the prevention and treatment of secondary transmissions and sub-septic shock, and the protection of vital organs is also important for SARS-COV-2 patients.
It is known that a cytokin storm is the result of excessive reactions to SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is the reaction of a multiplication process with the characteristics of the release of a series of cytokines including TNF®, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL, FN̆, FN®, FN®, MCP-1.
These cytokines encourage the immune system to release large quantities of free medical drugs that are a major cause of ADDS as well as the failure of most organs.
The stress of immune systems is vital to the treatment of cytokines, especially for serious patients.
Corticosteroids and tolicazumab, anti-IL6 monoclon, have been used to treat the cytokin storm.
Other anti-depression therapy includes the control of the body’s reactions directed to the T cell; the stop of IFN-, IL-1, and TNF; the name of the JAK; lunatumab; pressure for the use of the cytokine 4 and HDAC.
steroids, such as immunosuppressants, are widely used for SARS therapy to reduce the risk of swelling.
However, steroids on high levels have not contributed to serious lung damage to SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Rather, it may result in tragic side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which has a significant impact on prognosis.
Even so, a short system of corticosteroids in lower to middle levels has been recommended for careful use of COVID-19 highly ill patients.
At the time of writing, no effective treatment against infection had been established.
However, remdesivir, nucleotide analog, was found to work in an American patient with COVID-19.
The Remdesir is a new antiviral drug that Gilead first produced for the treatment of Ebola and Marlburg virus.
Later, the reminisir also indicated that it could prevent RNA viruses with a single line connecting MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has given China an element to conduct research for SARS-COV-2, and the results are seriously considered.
In addition, birititinb, interferon- aft,lopinar/ritonavir, and Ribabilin have been raised as a possible treatment for serious respiratory - respiratory patients.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious reactions may occur after a combination of lipinavir/riitonavir.
The effectiveness of this treatment and other medications used in patients should be considered carefully.
Plasma from recovered patients and the development of immune systems
The collection of blood for recovering patients from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting disease rather than longer history.
In fact, patients who have recovered often have a high rate of antibodies against the disease in their blood.
The immune system is the immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes in order to fight disease and other substances that are not essential in the body and can detect different cells and make them not directly active.
Based on this, plasma was collected in the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was administered to 10 patients in a crucial way.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and infection levels as well as improved oxygen levels.
However, confirmation and clarification are needed in order to make the recommendation that a procedure be widely used before any treatment is improved.
In addition, when considering the side effects of treatment, some side effects with blood plasma should be considered carefully.
The immune system, for example, can greatly encourage reactions to the immune system and cause cytokine release, which may be life - threatening risks.
The amount of immunity in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma is great if it can be treated in extremely serious cases.
It is difficult to develop and produce certain antibodies too quickly to combat a global epidemic.
For this reason, it is very important and logical to distinguish between the B cells for patients who are recovered and to be marked by genetic codes that have active genes or the immune system working to represent the vital proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the combination of various parts in various forms based on the study of the disease based on the TCM.
Most of the working parts remain unknown or are not as clear as it is difficult to tear down and confirm such parts or their more efficient combinations.
In the meantime, because of a lack of effective and precise treatment of COVID-19, TCM has turned into one of the major treatments of mild-signed patients to the middle of those who recover in critical stages.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du pills and the Lian Hua Qing Wen have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
High rates for treatment of COVID-19 patients were noted in many Chinese states who have used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Republic of Hubei, still in use TCM about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had a very low rate of recovery (13%).
This, however, is a misimpression as other factors such as the number and quality of patients should be included in a review.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published research on measuring West medicine alone (WM) and a combination of WM and TCM.
They found that the times required for the body’s temperature to be improved, symptoms ending, and hospitalization were short for the WM+TCM group only than the WM group.
Even more impressive, that the level of symptoms (from small to serious) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group only (7.4% compared with 46.2%) and death was much lower in the WM+TCM group than only the WM group (8.8% compared with 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and security of TCM still awaits well - managed research at many major levels and centers.
It can also be of interest that the course of action is noted and made clear that active parts of TCM treatment or their combinations are possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmed that they are suffering from COVID-19 often have a serious fear of a highly contagious and deadly disease, and people who are confined to them again have a relapse, a feeling of loneliness, and anger.
In addition, such symptoms as fever, hypoxia, and cough and serious side effects of treatment such as sleep - related corticosteroids may lead to increased anxiety and mental depression.
In the first phase of SARS, many mental - health - related diseases that include chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, stroke, mood disorders, mental disorders, and even suicide were reported.
COVID-19, a series of rigid communication and closings, as part of the public health response to the development of COVID - 19, may cause many people to become anxious and feel guilty about the consequences of involvement, isolation, and burial in the family and friends.
As a result, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having it, people connected with them and the general community that they need.
Mental help should include the development of many mental groups of mental health systems, a clear and regular and accurate communication with regard to the progress of SARS-CV-2 as well as medical procedures and the use of electrical therapy and procedures to avoid close contact with others.
Practical goals are vital to break free from the contact line from animals and infected people to targets that may be exposed and are often associated with antibiotics in the control of new viral infections.
Efforts have been made to develop goals based on the S protocol to make long and effective defenses and to kill and/or protect against access to SARS-COV.
Low - powered goals have been studied in animals in connection with SARS.
However, the work of these biologists is a goal for the elderly, as well as a number of life - threatening specialized models, as well as their protection against the spread of germs from animals to humans that will still be found before medical research begins.
This is because the SARS has remained silent 17 years ago and no new illness has been reported since then.
On the other hand, rare conditions and MERS groups continue to be spread from the Middle East and spread in other regions as a result of the persistence of biological sources from animals to humans in infected areas.
MERS vaccines have been developed by use of non-invasive bacteria, DNA plasma, microorganics, nanoparticles, microorganic crystals and subgroup units, and some have been tested in animal models.
The building of a safe and active target against the SARS-COV-2 in the people involved is an urgent and important task in controlling the continued epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to withstand the difficulties because of the long period (the average of 18 months) required for the development of the goal and the different types of COV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to demonstrate its program of full medical care in thousands of patients.
In many cases, patients can recover gradually without the effects of a previous disease.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a higher rate of sickness and death among seriously ill patients.
Therefore, building a model for the cause of the disease is important to health care in order to put its screens first, especially in areas with small help.
Based on reported medical research to date, the following factors may affect or be linked to the cause of COVID-19 patients (The Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the cause of SARS, also true of COVID-19.
COVID-19 appeared primarily at the age of 30-65 and 47.7% of those patients were more than 50 in a study of 8,866, as described above.
Patients who needed attention from critical conditions had a higher chance of being infected with other diseases and complexities and were significantly older than those without (66 ages compared with 51), which suggests that age is a factor in the effect of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-COV-2 has caused more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared with 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Diseases already present and complex: COVID - 19 patients who need serious care have a high risk of heart damage and arhythmia.
Cardiovascular events were also the leading cause of the death of SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-COV-2 is also able to stick to ACE2-positive lollocytes, which may lead to liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is good to note that the age and disease already present are closely related and may be confusing.
The effects of an unusual laboratory: The level of C-reacticive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the risk of swelling or damage to the muscles and has been raised as a potential cause of illness, response to treatment, and complete recovery.
There is also a connection between the CRP level and the risk of COVID-19.
In addition, the high lactate dehydrogenese (LDH), arratate aminotransferase (AST), aalinine amentransferrase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also have been helpful to predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely displayed in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during muscle damage.
As a result, they are common signs of heart failure or liver failure.
Major medical symptoms: COVIVIVID-19.
The use of steroids: As described above, IMunoppressant steroids are often used as an additional treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the risk of swelling.
Since the high number of corticosteroids has been applied to patients with a serious SARS, most of the survivors were suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with a life - style disability and an adverse quality of life.
As a result, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low rate and for short periods for COVID-19 patients.
Depression: As described above, during the accident of COVID - 19 many patients suffered as they had to endure long periods of silence and extreme uncertainty and to witness the death of close family members and patients.
It is vital that mental counseling and long - term support be given to help patients recover from depression and return to normal health.
In harmony with human information research until now, COVID-19 appears to have the characteristics of epidemiological elements different from SARS.
In addition to repeated in the lower respiratory system, SARS-COV-2 is able to multiply easily in the upper lung and cause little or no symptoms in the first phase of infection, similar to common flufs.
Therefore, patients involved in the first stage or the period of diagnosis can produce a large number of infection during everyday activities, resulting in greater difficulty in the control of the epidemic.
However, the SARS-COV invasion was thought to occur when patients were very sick, while most infections did not occur in the first phase.
As a result, the movement of COVID-19 is more critical and difficult to control than the SARS.
There are many current efforts in China that include the Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuing closing of the entire population in hopes of hindering the transmission of SARS-CV-2.
Although these measures have had a serious impact on the economy and other parts of the world, the number of new patients is on the decline, reflecting a decline in the rate of the epidemic.
The most promising average is that the departure will end in March and the slowing stage will continue for 3-4 months.
Some scholars, however, offer no such hope.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be more related to SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longingini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-COV-2 may carry two thirds of the world’s population.
The Canadian team reported that SARS-CV-2 were found in both mid-turrbinate and in the throats of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly discovered virus may have been a repeat chapter similar to the flu.
However, promising signs appear in China on the basis of the decline in the number of sick young people, indicating that the current strategy may be effective.
Previously, it had been predicted that Ebola would have infected one million people and half a million of them dead.
However, because of severe pent - up and strong isolation, the disease is eventually controlled.
It may be possible, like SARS-COV, that SARS-COV-2 may be weak and may become weak and eventually die out or become a less healthful virus that is able to interact with humans.
A comparison of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is given below (Death.5).
SARS-COV-2 contributes much to coughing or coughing, and it may be by direct contact with infected objects.
The virus was reemerged from the feces, producing a new opportunity of transfer from the feces to the mouth.
A recent study of38 patients reported that 41% of patients might have been admitted to hospitals, including 17 patients who had previously been infected with other diseases and 40 health personnel.
Hence, greater precautions should be taken to protect people, especially health - care workers, health - care workers, family members, their friends, and even people who are close to the sick or vulnerable.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear your face masks; both the use of surgery masks and N95 repier (a series # 1860s) helps control the spread of bacteria.
Facial masks block fluids from someone who may have fallen into the air and stick to the face of things, where they can be passed on to other people.
However, only N95 masks (a series #1860s) can protect you from inhaling small bisions from 10 to 80 mms, while only 5% of the bions are able to pass completely; SARS-CV-2 is the same size as SAS-CV both are about 85 mm.
Since the cells can pass through the five combined surgical masks, patients who work directly with patients must wear N95 masks (a series #1860s) rather than surgery masks.
In addition to the masks, health - care workers need to wear enough protective gloves to reduce the risk of infection.
Microorganisms can infect an individual directly.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor was admitted to SARS-COV-2 although she was wearing N95 masks; the virus may have entered her body by entering her eyes and appearing.
As a result, health - care workers should also wear face - to - face protections or glasses while working with patients.
In the general community in affected or perhaps affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with soap more often than usual, try to sit in the house so as to keep themselves and start in contact with people who may be infected.
A three - step walk is viewed as the ideal distance from patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of infection.
Although SARS-COV-2 arrived as a new virus in the world of mankind, its presence with the SARS-COV structure as reported on January 7, 2020 should be a warning to China because it still remembered the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, until January 2020, the director of the Center of Disease Control in Wuhan assures residents that the new virus has a small and small recombination and that it is not a problem to prevent and control disease.
This message made public sense, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and they missed a crucial time of controlling the virus before the Wuhan.
Chinese disease - control mechanisms can learn from this crucial lesson and make important progress in the future.
For example, these agents should (1) be more careful when they make public declarations as they are important to the citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) feel and respond more to unusual information from a clinic than wait for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) prevent them from controlling what may be a epidemic in their first stage instead of trying to comfort the public; and (4) often do so as to improve public awareness regarding infectious diseases and to improve public awareness of them.
The development of COVID-19 caused by a new SARS-COV-2 virus at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is much like SAS-COV and symptoms are also the same between COVID-19 and SARS, the development of COVID-19 creates the feeling that SARS is repeated.
However, there is a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is essential to controlling the disease and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects more adults than men and men than women, and the risk of death is higher in adults than in youths.
SARS has a mortality rate higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared with 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients pass on the virus even when they have no symptoms while SARS patients pass it when they are very sick, which causes a greater problem in controlling COVID-19s than SARS.
This explains in part why the SARS-COV-2 is much faster and more widely extended than the SARS-COV.
A normal RNA analysis of SARS-COV-2 may have an influence on some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who are treated may become more sensitive to the virus’s diagnosis.
This discovery greatly increases the risk of infection infection.
With rapid progress in COVID - 19 research, there are a few serious problems that need to be solved, including:
Where does SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although it has been found that there are 96% similarities between SARS-COV-2 and two COV bats like SARS, we cannot conclude that SARS-CV-2 are derived from bats.
Which animal was in the center that transmitted the virus from the first tree, say bats, to humans?
If we don't know the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot successfully cut back, and the relapse may be worse at any time.
Although cell models and biochemic analysis have shown that SARS-COV-2 adhere to ACE2, how does the virus actually enter the respiratory cells and cause changes that lead to resulting ill health?
Is the virus also attached to the cells that show ACE2 in other parts of the body?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot come up with a quick, accurate diagnosis and treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How do the genes change during human interactions?
Will it become a global epidemic, will it end up like the SARS or will it become worse from time to time like a flu?
It is important, but it may take some time to search for the answers to the above questions and many more questions.
Regardless of the cost, however, we have no choice but to prevent the epidemic as soon as possible and to restore our health to the normal condition.
The origin of the virus from animals to the human coronavirus
The change and harmony of the situation have encouraged coronavirus (Coms) and its structure, including people, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two COVs (HCOVs) were known to cause mild illness, as common fever.
The rise of the setre acute respiration syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiration syndrome (MERS) have changed the situation to show how much damage HCOV can cause and greater life.
The appearance of SARS-COV-2 in China in the mid-2019 replayed COVs and surprised us with a high precision but with reduced pathogenicity compared with her sister SARS-COV.
HCOV is a zoonosis and an understanding of the origins of HCOV zomonotics can help us.
Many HCOVs come from bats and do not cause disease in them.
Central HCOVs are also known.
The identification of animal pets has positive effects on the prevention of human diseases.
Research into the interactions of the CV organization with animals may provide important insight regarding the development of CV in humans.
In this review, present a summary of the already existing knowledge about seven HCOVs, and we will focus on the history of their discovery and its origin of zoonotics as well as on the interaction of various species.
More importantly, we compare and divide separate HCOVs from the theory of mutations and genetic combinations.
The current COV epidemic of the 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful industrial change and the effects of the virus’s change to the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (Covs) are part of the Coronaridae family, which consists of a closed, obscenous, single RNA group of bacteria.
These viruses are the largest of 26 to 32 pounds [32 kg] of RNA bacteria called "COV" because of their trophology that resembles a crown under the electron microscope.
According to the building, COVs have non-genetes that do not have the same order.
Nearly three parts of the root consist of two large separate reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), translated to be replicase polyprotein p1a and p1abs.
Polyproteins are further researched to form 16 additional nonstructures, called ansp1 ~16.
The remaining portion of the frame contains ORF building proteins, including spicke (S), envelopes (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
The number of useful proteins related to the list also has a list of different versions of COV.
Based on the different types of proteins, COVs are fitted in sections of four sections (alpha-CV, beta-CV, gamma-Cov, and Delta-CV), where the beta-CV field contains most HCVs and is divided into four columns (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and mice are the source of Alpha-Cov genes and beta-CVs, while birds are the source of gamma-Cov and Delta-COVs.
For thousands of years, COVs have progressively gone beyond the boundaries of nature, and most of them have become the most important pitogens in the human population.
Up to now, seven COVs (HCOVs) are known.
Among them HCOV-229E and HCV-NL63 are Alpha-COV.
Five other beta-CVs include HCV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, set out for respiration disorder coronavirus (SARS-COV), Central East respiration disorder coronatory (MERS-COV) and SARS-COV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 often cause small signs, such as common fever and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and the recently discovered SARS-CV-2 are a major cause of serious respiratory illness, resulting in a serious respiratory illness in a number of patients, resulting in a high chance of developing acrostic respiary syndrome (ARDS) and other diseases that occur outside the lungs.
The first type of HCOV-229E, B814, was separated from normal fever-cushion in the mid-60s.
Since then, more information has been obtained about the detailed HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43, both of which causes automatic signals.
In fact, the view was adopted that HCOVs are generally safe until the SARS is launched.
The rise of SARS in 2003 is one of the sadest in present history, which caused more than 8000 cases and had a death rate of nearly 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiration syndrome (MERS) resulted in a ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with occasional rapid expansion in other parts of the world.
The new HCOV (2019-nCOV), later named SARS-COV-2, is a major cause of the ongoing scourge of colonavirus for 2019 (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alum has also been crying and the earth must be ready for the coming SARS-COV-2.
All seven HCOVs have the origin of zoonotics from bats, mice, or livestock.
Much evidence supports the origin of the evolution of all HCOVs from bats, in which bacteria adapt themselves well and do not cause disease but show a wide range of genes.
The COVID-19 epidemic has raised major medical, scientific, social, and cultural challenges in China and in the world.
Tracking the origins of HCOV zoologists provides a framework for understanding natural history, force, and development factors for the flight of creatures.
This can also guide or help in considering the cause, which is in the middle as well as the creation of the sARS-COV-2, which will have a significant effect on future transmission control.
In this review he introduced a summary of the origin of zoonotics, interconnected species and HCOV-pathogenesis.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the same bullet that HCOV - parent bacteria are usually responsible not for sickness on their natural host but for sickness after contact with the various creatures and the new host.
We also return to the HCOV calendar when the increase in concentrations usually comes and the decline of pathogenicity.
The effects of the continuing SARS-COV-2 is discussed in this context.
Animal COVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first division of HCOV-229E, B814 from the nose of patients who had contracted common fever, separate COVs were separated from various types of animals, including garlic, rats, cattle, pigs, cat and dog.
Over the past decades, seven HCOVs have been found.
A brief summary of the history of HCOV discovery in sequence (The Table 1) may benefit and teach.
The first type of HCOV-229E was separated from the pulmonary respiration of upper respiratory patients by the year 1966, and was accepted to grow into the WI-38 lung cells.
HCOV-229E patients had common flu symptoms, including headaches, nausea, malaria and sore throats, and fever and coughs were seen in 10, ~20%.
Later in 1967, the HCV-OC43 separated from the muscle joint and the synthesis of the next chain in the digestive glands.
HCV-OC43 operations appear to be similar to those caused by HCV-229E, which were not divided according to the symptoms of other respiratory infections such as flu virus A and Rhinovirus.
Both HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43 are spread around the globe, and it is usually joining during the winter season in good weather.
Usually, the two infections are less than a week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to the study of human volunteers, healthy HCOV-229Es suffer from mild flu.
Only a few patients with depressed immune systems showed serious respiratory problems below.
SARS, also known as "a rare pneumonia", became the first plague of HCOV recorded in human history and is the cause of SARS-COV, the third received HCOV.
The first disease caused by SARS can be traced to the end of 2002 in China’s Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic led to a report of 8,096 patients and 774 dead, scattered in many countries and continents.
Apart from the major dispersals, it was estimated that each event could cause at least two other events, during a 4- to 7 - day diagnosis and the rise of the virus in the 10th day of illness.
Patients associated with SARS-COV at first seemed to suffer from myalgia, headaches, fever, malaria and fever, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory stress as symptoms.
lymphopiania, faulty liver testing, and high cotinea kinnase are among the unusual things of the virus that are common because of SARS.
The spread of analveor damage, the movement of the epitheral cell and the growth of macrophages are marked in SARS patients.
At least 20-30% of patients need serious care and air-conservation.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, many body organs that include the nervous system, liver, and kidneys can also be involved in these critical conditions, which are often associated with the cytokine, which may kill especially patients with dangerous immune systems.
The virus was first separated from the open lung for the first relative of the patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made in connection with HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 was separated from a seven - month - old Dutch child by the end of 2004.
First it was discovered that it had increased in young children, older people, and patients with immune systems who were exposed to respiratory infections.
The presence of coryza, conjuncititis, fever, and bronchiliitis is common to HCOV-NL63.
One independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the vertebrae of an 8 - month - old man who suffered from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Though discovered in the Netherlands, it is actually spreading around the world.
It has been estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of normal respiratory infections, and its high event occurs early in summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with opticive laryngitis, also known as a cross.
In the same year, HCOV-HKKU1 was separated from a 71 - year - old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchilitis in Hong Kong.
Apart from social media and bronchilitis, HCOV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acoustic astrocity.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 was found around the world, causing mild respiratory infections.
All these existing HCVs are highly compatible with humans and are often less able to change into the most pathogenic diseases, although accidents occur for reasons unknown as in the unusual form of the highly lethal HCOV-NL63 form, reportedly cause serious respiratory disease below China.
Often, when these HCOVs gain the ability to easily enter and maintain them in a continuous state within the people, they also kill or are slightly pathogenic.
The MERS-COV was first distinguished in 2012 from a 60 - year - old patient who had a serious pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the conditions confirmed are from the Middle East, imported conditions are spread to nearby victims reported in various European and Tunisia countries.
Another second transition took place in South Korea in 2015 with the events of 186 confirmed.
MERS's appearance is similar to that of the SARS, noted by a progressive critical hormone.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients suffered serious kidney failure, which is at present different from MERS among HCV diseases.
More than 30% of patients have evidence of up to 30 percent of gestrates, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Since February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 reported cases have been reported with high mortality rates of death by 34.4%, making MERS-COV one of the most dangerous microbes in humans.
From mid- December 2019 to its end, many patients with pneumonia known as sARS-COV-2 were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization called the outbreak of low - respiratory respiratory disease caused by SARS-COV-2 as a Public Health Emergency to Concern the World and named the COVID-19.
On March 3, 2020, there were reported 90,053 patients around the world, with 3.4% death rates.
Significantly, the number of deaths in Hubei, China is 4.2%, whereas the other is 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 causes a serious respiratory disorder such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, which has been introduced as fever, coughs and dyspnea.
Patients also suffer from diarrhea.
pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can progress rapidly into acceritary stress disorder.
Although SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar because of the very high sequence of nucleotide is 82%, there are different groups in the branches of the phylogenic tree.
SARS-COV-2 appears to be a little pathogenic but very closely related to SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
It is reported that there are people who have no symptoms and may have an immediate effect on their worldwide growth.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-COV-2 with other six HCOVs produces a very interesting contrast.
First, the period of diagnosis and duration of HCOV disease is very similar.
In this regard, SARS-COV-2 follows the usual calendar of six other HCOVs.
Second, the risk of COVID-19 signals is between SARS-COV and the four available HCOV-229E (that is, HCOV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CV-2 shows the symptoms often seen during the transmission of HCOVs to the public, which include a lack of clear symptoms, slight symptoms or lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, the lower set of emergency conditions of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the condition of SARS-COV disease, though the ratio is low.
Third, the SARS-COV-2 link also shows interesting carpets with both the characteristic HCOV and the SARS-COV.
On the other hand, the transfer of SARS-COV-2 is as high as the found HCOVs.
On the other hand, it will still be determined if the SARS-COV-2 transmission is slowing to people as in the conditions of SARC-COV and MERS-COV.
Finally, as with other HCOVs, SARS-COV-2 can be found in samples in the wild.
Whether the SARS-COV-2 transmission plays an important role when it comes to the SAFS-COV under certain conditions will be explained in future research.
It is also of great interest to see if SARS-COV-2 will show up at certain seasons as is the case with HCOVs found in the community.
Nevertheless, SARS-COV-2 factors, including their additions, protrusions, and secure growth after the transition to the people will have an impact on the final outcome of the ongoing movement of COVID-19.
All HCOVs found in the community cause little signs to adapt well to people.
According to one view, it may also be true that people are quite compatible with these four HCOVs.
In other words, both probably survived the pre - HCOV epidemic.
HCOVs cause serious illnesses in humans, and there are no more major HCOV infections.
For this to be done, HCOVs must go back to the people to the extent necessary to allow for the growth of changes that are in harmony with the factors of union pregnancy.
In this way, if the rise of SARS-COV-2 is persistent and affecting a large number of people, there will be a greater chance of getting along with the people.
If they are highly compatible, its impact on people may be difficult to restrain by restraining them or by some other means of controlling the flow.
For many years, COVs has been found in a social eccentric community, causing common flu to people who have a proper response to antibodies.
These germs do not need an animal’s source.
In contrast, SARS-COV and ERS-COV in pathogenic have not yet been well compatible with the people and their internal interactions cannot be preserved.
They need to keep themselves in shape and grow up in their biological source and want the opportunity to pass on to vulnerable victims, likely by one or more central tower and to raise visitors.
SARS-COV-2 have the same features as both SARS-COV/MERS-COV and the four available HCOVs in the community.
It is more common than HCOVs found in the community, at least in the first creation.
However, the pathogenic is much higher than HCOVs found in the community and has less pathogenic than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
There is still to be seen whether they will fully get along with humans and move around without the source or the central layer of the animal.
Before discussing the origins of HCOV animals, it will be helpful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolution, natural, source, internal, and generating HCOV.
An animal becomes a transition HCOV if it holds a closely related ancestor with a high degree of nucleotide.
The adult virus is usually highly compatible and does not cause any ill effects on the misdemeanor.
Similarly, the source plant keeps HCOV on and on for a long time.
In both cases, hosts are naturally involved and are natural HCOVs or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCOV is reintroduced to a central gas or to the introduction of humans, they are not properly adjusted to a new chemical and often cause disease.
The central spider may be a biological source of human infusion and play a role in the magnifying of the virus that allows the virus to multiply for a short time and pass on to the people to increase human transmission rate.
HCOV may experience a final replacement if it is not able to maintain its attachment inside the centre of gravity.
On the contrary, HCOVs are able to adapt to the central gas and even establish long - term chemistry.
In this case, the central layer becomes a source of natural energy.
The epideological data showed that back in view that the SARS patient had a history of contact with hunted animals.
The subsequent studies of the proprietors showed that cartels have a higher IgG against the SAFS-COV compared with the number of people in the general population.
The masked palm civet (paga larvata) and the carcoon dog in the animal market were found to carry viruses such as SARS-COV similar to SARS-COV.
This was accurately supported by the fact that no further SARS reported after the destruction of all market civets.
It has been reported, however, that the wild masked palm civet or the unexplored farm of the animal industry was a source of decay in the SARS-COV, suggesting that masked palm civets may be the center - growth plant but not the natural source of SARS-COV.
Significantly, 80% of the various animals of Guangzhou market have immune systems against SARS-COV, we are not able to ignore the possibility that many mammals are the proprietors of the central SARS-COV.
All of these appear to be the last SARS-COV visitors.
The next study of the SAFS-COV natural animal created a coV closely related to the bat, known as SARS-related Rhinolopus bat WOV HKU3 (SARSR-Rh-BatCOV HKUM3), which is found in a butterfly called a Chinese horse shoe.
These are supercomputers when it comes to antibodies against SARS-COV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCOV HK3.
This and other compatriots are divided by 88-92% of nucleotide and SARS-COV.
These studies have led to the development of a new idea that bats are vaccinating new species of people.
COVs such as SARS (SL-COVs) are marked on bats, but they are not the only ones called Wiv1 can be classified as a living virus.
Angiotensuning enzyme 2 (ACE2) of humans is known as the SANS-COV provider.
AWV1 from a bat dung dump was shown to be using bat, civet, and ACE2 people as a porter.
Interestingly, SARS's recuperation of patients was capable of killing Wiv1.
Until now, Wiv1 represents the closely related ancestor of SARS-COV in bats, sharing 95% of nucleotide.
Although there is a high probability between these two bacteria, it is generally believed that Wiv1 is not a single parent of the SARS-COV and that bats were the nearest host of SAS-COV.
phylogenetic analysis includes MERS-COV with the same group as the COV-HKU4 bug and COV-HKUR5 bug.
The COV-HKU4 bat and MERS-COV use the same compatributor, dippracticise 4 (DPP4), from infection.
The sequence of RNA's RNA based on the MERS-COV's RNA is closely related to its beta-CV-gete found in Europe and Africa.
Until now, no MERS-COV is available from wild bats.
MERS-COV and its close relative COV-HKUK 25 bat share only in 87% of nucleotide’s eceology.
As a result, bats may not be a local source of ERS-COV.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have shown that camels with aerosols are in the immune system directly killing MERS-COV, similar to camels that originated in the Middle East in many African countries.
A living MERS-COV similar to a virus found in humans was separated from the driveway of a dromedary camel, which further indicated that the camels are the real source of the MERS-COV.
It is also noteworthy that there were often minor symptoms but the major release of the MERS-COV cameras by research.
Significantly, not only through the respiratory system but also through the vocal cords, which are also the principal means of infection from bats.
However, questions remain, since many MERS cases have no record of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, it may be that a human interaction from one person to another or a unknown link involving unknown animals that include ERS-COV.
SARS-CV-2 share 96.2% of nucleotides and COV RaTG13 bat separated from Rhinolopas afins.
As with SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the differences between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 are too large to be assigned to a parent's relationship.
That means, the bats may have been the nearest source of SARS-COV-2 unless the discovery of about the same bats in the future.
It is estimated that, the guardians of the central wild animal of SARS-COV-2 should be among the wildlife sold and killed at the Huanan Seawood Wheel Market, most of which was associated with the first COVID-19 disease, which indicates that there may have been a link between animals and humans.
A few recent studies based on the sequence of metagenomic have suggested that a group of small mammals known as gangolins (Manis javanica) may be harboring old beta-COV related to SARS-COV-2.
These new gangolin CoV is equal in 85-92% of nucleotides and SARS-COV-2.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 for about 90% of the degree of nucleotide sequence.
They come together into two subgroups of bacteria similar to SARS-CV-2 on a phylogenic tree, one of which shares the background of a much like RBD (RBD) and SARS-CV-2, and the corresponding combination of amino acid.4%.
In sharp contrast, the SABS-COV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although there is a high degree of ecumenism.
An earlier study of sick Pangolins reported the discovery of infected cantigs in lung samples, which appear to be related to SARS-COV-2.
The study used a variety of construction methods and manual designs to form a sequence of the element built up about 86.3% of the total length of the biological frame.
We are not able to set aside the chance that gangolin is one of the nearby SARS-COV-2 animals.
However, there is no evidence at present that gangolin is a direct source of SARS-COV-2 because of the differences between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CV-2 of the gangolin associated with beta-COV.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CV-2 and RaTG13 is much shorter between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV-2 of the refractions associated with beta-COV.
SARS-COV-2 of bats, pangolins, and other mammals will yet be discovered.
Although high-ordered ecumenism is found in RBDs between SARS-CV-2 and gangolin, SARS-COV-2 related to beta-CV, SARS-CV-CV-2 and RaTG13 are shared by the higher ecumulates.
There are high suspicions that a high degree of RBS-COV-2 gangolin associated with beta-COV and SARS-COV-2 is being conducted by a reversion of contact.
Another recommendation recommends the recombination between SARS-COV-2 pangolin related to beta-COV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal.
Like the force of evolution, the re-organization is spread among the beta-COVs.
The conclusion is not yet reached as to the source of nearby sARS-COV-2.
In addition to the most sophisticated HCOV, the source of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that both HCOV-NL63 and HCV-229E may have started in batting, while the parent bacteria of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 found in rats.
It is reported that the ARCOV.2 bat (Apalachian RidgeCV) found in the three-colored North American bat showed close contact with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was related to another butterfly, called Hipposideros/Gina Kwam/Kama/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while calameds have been suspected of being its nearest unit.
To explain, the current information about the animal origins of known HCOVs is reached in Picture 1 and Table 2.
The analysis of phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the climates of HCOV species in history.
When HCOV-OC43 was from another animal to be passed on to the people from domestic animals about 1890, the respiratory disease was recorded.
The history of the variety of HCOV-229Es is not very clear.
A related HCOV-229E have been found.
Among them is the aceca alpha-Cov.
A few evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First of all, people, not the alpacas, may be contacting bats in the same environment.
Instead, people are closer to one another with alpacas.
Secondly, HCOV-229E bat are different and does not cause illness in bats, whereas the aceca alpha-CV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca’s Alpha-Cov has not yet been found in wild animals.
As a result, we will not ignore the possibility that the acecas get the alpha-COV associated with HCOV-229E people.
In fact, bats are a direct source of bacteria that cause people’s illness, including the bacteria of the rabbi, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats may transmit HCOV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, where the Alpha-CVs works as a set of HCV-229E genes, alpacas and hydromedary camels may be the central virus that transmits the virus to humans, as is MERS-COV.
MERS-COV is a good example of the interaction of species from bats to hydrogen cameras to humans.
The origin of the MERS-COV evolution from bats is known in its original identification and is confirmed by the following findings.
Evidently, bats give different kinds of bacteria the opportunity for genetic variation between different animals and intersectings.
Long life, crowded colonies, close public relations and powerful flight skills are all ideal conditions for bats to become a good "visitor of the virus.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has been established for centuries with a dromedary camel.
It is perfectly compatible for these camels to turn into a stable and natural source.
MERS-COV causes little illness and has a lower rate of change in these animals.
Its influx is a mistake and people remain the last match of the MERS-COV since its transmission cannot be saved.
Unlike the camel role in the MERS-COV transmission, the role of gangolin, if available, in the SARS-COV-2 distribution is different.
In particular, the beta-Congolin beta-Congolins cause serious illness in the pangolins.
It may be the last beta-Cov related to SARS-COV-2, like civets in the SARS-COV state.
A few possibilities for the interaction of species with the SARS-COV-2 from animals to humans should be considered or not considered in future studies.
First, bats may be the source of the SARS-COV-2 virus related to the SARS-COV-2 similar to SARS-COV-2.
People may play the same role as bats through surgery or coal mining.
Second, gangolins may be a growing layer in the middle of which the virus related to SARS-COV-2 has recently been introduced.
Humans are infected by surgery and eating raw meat.
It may be that many mammals including pets can be exposed to SARC-COV-2.
A study of animal and wildlife conservation needs.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and reconciliation of SARS-COV-2 may occur in the third animal associated with both bats and pangolins.
The memory of the SARS-COV-2 animal continues.
Apart from the various kinds of animal hosts, there are three main elements on the side of the virus that are important in making the COVs cross the line of creatures.
First, their high number of changes in RNA repeat.
Compared with other RNA viruses that have a single line, the average number of changes of COVs may be viewed as "little" to "extensive" in terms of changes 010-4 each year for each 2-, depending on the CV balance unit for new hosts.
COVs have oxyribonucleases for looking for errors, their removal results in extreme changes and loss of strength or the inability to develop properly.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress the multiplication of COV by the prohibition of this xorobonicase and the RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising claims against SARS-CV-2 medical research.
Even so, the rate of change of COVs is about one million times higher than those of nonmembers.
In addition, the number of changes is usually higher if COVs are not properly in harmony with the organization.
Compared with the SARS-COV which has the highest number of changes, the number of changes SARS-CV-2 appears to be low, suggesting a higher degree of human tolerance.
Supposedly, it may already have been agreed upon by another man - made tower.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this applies again to MERS-COV, which is well-conV, in accordance with hydrogen camels.
It is thought that genetic changes are unlikely to cause anti-SARS-COV-2 infections to slow down.
Second, a large removable RNA root in COVs uses more flexibility in the transformation and recombination, thus increasing the opportunity for a variety of creatures, which is beneficial in the development of new COV conditions.
This is supported by many different reading and protein frames that are produced at the third end of the frame.
Third, COV constants automatically change the networks during retribution RNA in a different "copy-mode option".
In the organization that acts as a composite container, a change of type occurs regularly during the COV RNA channel.
RNAs with full length of homologouss and subgenomics may reconvenate to form new COVs.
Phylogenetic evidence has been found in both HCOV-HKU1, HCV-OC43, and animal coVs such as SL-CV for bat and batCV-HKU9.
Bacterial interaction with the plant in connection with the transmission
In addition to the three components of the virus mentioned above, the link between the virus and the motherland is another major factor that affects the interaction of species.
Here, the recombination of SARS-COV is considered to be a general example, showing evidence of a partial selection during the instances of inter-connected species.
Based on comparison between separate persons and SARS-COV in civet, it is thought that SARS-COV is dealing with quick response to different hosts, especially with changes in S.D.
Usually, RBD in S COV coV protocol cooperates with the ladder operator and is strongly selected for the alarm immune response.
In SARS-COV, RBD is at 318 amino acids to 510 in the S1 part, which adheres to the human ACE2 and its coreceptors for infection.
SABS-COV is able to see the ACE2 distributions of various animals, including bat, civet, rats, and raccoon dog, which allow the virus to be transmitted by different creatures.
In fact, only 6 remains of amino acid that have been noted to be different from the distribution of the human virus and the civet in RBD are 4 of which are found in a motif attached to a distribution to the ACE2 distribution.
The SARS-COV of the Civet has changes to K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the level of Spike protein interaction with the human ACE2 distribution.
In other words, the changes of the two amino acids may be necessary in the transmission of the virus to humans.
It is significant that SARS-COV-2 has the same share of the SARS-COV.
The difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CV in S1 unit of S Proxy means that the level of contact for S and ACE2 people may have changed.
In fact, cylo-EM research shows a higher degree of 10-20 curves than between ACE2 people and S S S-CV.
It will also be of interest to determine whether further coreceptor is required for the SARS-COV-2 input.
Interestingly, HCOV-NL63 is again attached to ACE2 but with a different S section.
There are other HCOV distributions, such as aminooptidase N in HCOV-229E, and 9-O-acesyletic acid acid for HCV-OC43.
They may also be viewed as a reason for the successful blending of COVs to humans after the combination of different creatures from their animal hosts.
In addition to the cell hosts, the effect of the interaction of different living organisms with HCOV is also controlled by dependence on other forms and limitations.
The differences between these chemical compounds between humans and visitors who are the natural source of HCOVs as bats, hydrogen camels, and rats may create a barrier between different creatures.
HCOVs should take the factors of reliance on the owner and interfere with the factors of the impact of the fusion of the vibrities for successful interaction of creatures.
In this regard, cell - cell mates in this vital area of contact with the virus will still be seen and marked.
The comprehensive decomposition of the system depends on the environment and the SARS-CV-2 conceptions, using the modern CRISPR technology may be useful.
New HCOV appearance: restoring
The variety of batcos provides many opportunities for new HCOVs.
In this sense, bats serve as a set of HCOV genes.
In addition, rapid changes and genetic recombination continue to continue HCOV evolution and acts as two important steps in the process.
For example, the discovery or loss of genes that make up a new protein code has the power to alter the virus’s phnotypes dramatically.
Among the useful proteins in SARS-COV, ORF8 is thought to be important in human relations, since viruses related to SARS-COV are separated but found to produce different ORF8 proteins.
An element of the removal of 29-nucleotides of SARS-COV has been found in separated types at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal separates the ORF8a into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a flexible change that encourages the change of the hosts.
Besides, SARS-COV may have a history of re-unification with the albums of Alpha and gamma, where a large number of sub-divisions were found in the RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Recompositions were found again in nsp9, in large part of the ss10, and in sections of the nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-COV epidemic experienced recombination events between different ranges, which took place on the hydromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from SARS-COV and MERS-COV, recombination events have been marked by other HCOVs, where HCVs are reunited with other animal coVs in their nonstructures.
It should also be noted that the choice of making may be a contributing factor in uninvolved changes in the immune system, which may result in freeing the bacteria from the pressures of the choice used, such as those of the body’s immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of ORF4 complete length in the HCOV-229E version, due to a double nucleotide removal.
Although the completeORF4 was seen in the microbe related to HCOV-229E, the aceca-Cov shows a single nucleotide insert, which leads to a change in the frame.
Finally but most important, new HCOVs conversions are reimpressed by pressure to be selected from its source.
There were no signs or only small signals found when the bats were inserted with COVs, which indicate the same combination between COVs and bats.
It seems that bats are properly adapted to COVs in the construction and operational manner.
For example, the disorder of the use of reactions that encourage bacteria easily reduces the pathology introduced by COVs.
Besides, the function of a natural killer in bats is put under strain because of the rise in response to the reaction of the natural killer of NKG2/CD94 and the low level of the I complicated Hhistocompability.
In addition, high levels of oxygen (ROS) built up by a high - pressure harvest of bats may affect both the stress of recombination of the COV and the testing of errors by exoribunicase, thus providing the pressure for the development of the species of Pathgenics when it is introduced to a new host.
Highly pathogenic types may also be altered by recombination, leading to the discovery of new proteins or characteristics of the process of genetic engineering.
As a result, it is not just a chance that three new HCOVs have appeared in the last two decades.
Covs do not become ill with each other or cause little symptoms to their main fans like bats and camels.
They multiply rapidly without promoting the strong reactions of the immune system.
Here are some secrets as to why nonsigned carriers are seen and what causes serious conditions in people’s illness.
Particularly serious symptoms are caused by excessive immune function and a cytokine storm when there is strong reactions to the immune system, the damage to the lungs is even greater.
In contrast, for those who do not show symptoms, the reactions of the immune system have been divided into the multiplication of COV.
The same method of distinguishing reactions of the immune system may have a beneficial effect on treatment against SARS-COV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong for bats.
As a result, the use of I interferron type for at least the first stages of SARS-CV-2 input on people should be of benefit.
Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammsome is not valid.
According to this estimate, the NLRP3 inflammatory with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-COV-2 follows the standard server for SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Although the beta-Cov bat shared 95% of nucleotide family and SARS-COV, there is also the COV bug that shared in 96% of nucleotide hormone and SARS-COV-2.
Although civets and other market animals have been found to harbor bacteria such as SARS-COV, the neighborhood-cov-2 has not yet been found.
It has been found that gangolin beta-COV-2, which indicates that gangolins may be some middle-onals or gangolins that the gangolins may contribute to the genetic components in the final version of SARS-COV-2.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 is deliberately or indirectly created by man.
The COVs are returned to the theater because of a later SARS-COV-2 explosion.
The study of COVs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our view of the importance of the biological origin of onotics and HCV sources in human interactions.
The widespread evidence indicates that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 has a negative background and is transmitted to the people by middle-temporaries.
Since SARS-COV invasion is based on contact between people and commercial cives, closing the market of living animals and killing the carvets could have ended the SARS epidemic.
In the same opinion, pangolis should be removed from the biological markets in order to prevent the interference of the monoids, considering the discovery of many beta-Cov lists of pangolins closely related to SARS-COV-2.
However, whether it is transmitted and how it is transmitted to humans by pangolin and other mammals will yet be explained in future graves.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been present for long periods of drive.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as a main source of meat, honey, skin, and wool for local people.
It is widely scattered throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible for all camels to be killed to control the MERS, as is true in the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the circulation of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to prevent the MERS recurring MERS movement, a more detailed method must be used to develop practical goals against the camel MERS-COV, along with other measures of control.
Since we cannot eliminate these germs, new genotypes may appear to cause a new outbreak.
A variety of polyontics rotate in the wilderness.
In particular, the powerful bats are very different.
There are many opportunities for these voontics to change and reunite, which will result in new COVs who are able to get more in touch with each other and/or kill people in the future.
The tradition of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the case of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 cases, there should be the best preparation and response program.
In fact, the vast majority of the world’s long - standing microbes do exist.
They live in their natural habitat until they have the opportunity to leave.
Although bats have many characteristics that encourage the spread of bacteria, the possibility that humans can communicate with bats and other wild animals can be weakened if people are taught that they are distant from them.
Continued care of mammals is needed to better understand the nature of COV physics and its natural guardians, which will be helpful in preventing the transmission from from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
At the conclusion, the best way to prevent the microorganism is to keep people away from the natural environment of the biological reservoirs of zoonotic bacteria.
A few parts of the puzzle source of SARS-COV-2 have not yet been found.
First, if the bats transmit the original SARS-COV-2 virus to the gangolins, it will be helpful to see which conditions the bats and gangolins are capable of sharing in the relation to the environment.
Second, if fruit bats play a key role in human exploitation, it should be determined by how people communicate with bats.
Third, if a mammal acts as a literal medium of exchange, the way we deal with the various species of humans, bats and pangolins should be explained.
Finally, since many mammals and pets may be exposed to SARS-COV-2, both care and concentration of research should be done.
If it is a bat, a gangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-COV-2 or its parent viruses will be discovered in the future.
Continued research in this area will explain the course of evolution in animals, with significant results in the prevention and management of COVID-19 human beings.
The review of the assessment for those who are "confirmed" and "confirmed" that they have a COVID-19 need
On 6 February 2020, our team had published an early advice on the early test and treatment of the new Coronavirus extensions of the 2019 (2019-nCOV), and the program provided our experience as well as an appropriate pilot to combat this global epidemic.
However, the 1990 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is increasing on the basis of ongoing research and medical experience; that is why, screening techniques and treatment continue to be revised.
In this book, we answered one comment about our sentence and presented the matter of a new test for those who are "guilted" and "provised" that they are ill in accordance with Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh list) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus (2019-nCOV) had caused outbreaks, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named as the disease acute respiration syndrome coronatory 2 (SARS-COV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO referred to COVID-19 as a epidemic.
In order to combat the SARS-COV-2 contribution, our team has established a quick response route and is printed on the Internet on the Military Medical Research in February 2020.
He has received much attention since the publication.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, a growing awareness and knowledge about it is increasing on the basis of the findings and medical experience; that is why, attempts for diagnosis and treatment continue to be revised.
For example, Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19, published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http: /www.www.g.g.v.n/), between January 16, 2020 to 3, 2020, it has produced seven volumes when some things have been drastically changed.
Our essay received notice from Zhou et al., presenting a simple argument based on their experience.
Their work adds new proof of our attack and makes a significant reference to this epidemic all over the world.
We commend their precious work and express our gratitude.
However, their maker needs to be revised in accordance with the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), to ensure a condemned illness requires a combination of one or two elements of epidemological history and two operations for general analysis, or to meet three types of medical evidence without clear - cut epidemism:
The history of epidedological history: (1) the history of visiting or staying in the town of Wuhan and the environment, or other communities where COVID - 19 was reported 14 days before the beginning of symptoms; (2) the history of contact with people infected with SARS-CV-2 (by a study of nucleic acidic acid); (3) the history of contact with the Wuhan - environment, or other communities where COVID - 19 are reported in the 14 days before the beginning of symptoms; (4) the history of contact with many patients who have been affected with patients with the disease and symptoms between small, such as in the home, school.
Medical evidence: (1) fever and/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) with the symptoms of the COVID-19; (3) the total number of white blood cells that indicate a normal, low, or lower amount of lymphocyte count in the first paragraph.
The diagnosis of a confirmed illness should be based on the one suspected case of the following initogenic or pherical evidence: (1) a slow PCR of the real period of SARS-CV-2; (2) the sequence of a full term indicating high in the known viruses of the new carronavirus; (3) to be interested in having a direct IgM and IGGG'CV-2 for a reservultation; or the change of a specific IRC video model of the IRC-COV-V-CO-2, which indicates the higher degree of the virus.
We can see that a genuine study of nucleic acid time on the respiratory or blood samples is made up of two subsystems (18 January 2020) and a third (22 January 2020).
The availability of the pathogenic sample of blood is a component of the fourth in four systems (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); and the evidence for the pherological evidence is included in the seventh order.
These changes are based on the continuing work of researchers in search of a high nucleic acid for early testing, as well as respirator samples that include blood sample, which have increased the availability of different tissue, and have contributed to the rapid transmission of the immune response to a confirmed matter.
Besides, there is additional evidence that reminds us that we are on guard against patients with unusual symptoms and symptoms.
Thus, the Zhou et al. it should be repeated, since it refers to a person with no medical symptoms as "as a low risk".
The point - making process also needs to be reassured at work and in the ongoing medical courses.
In conclusion, we hope for further evidence to come and ask that the students observe.
For a test of "reprovable disease" and "provable disease", we recommend that the new international services be followed and heard in their home.
Our hosts will also turn to us for help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, a very high number of day
Last day, Bangladesh confirmed the five new deaths caused by COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest day’s number caused by the virus.
Since yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) has reported that the reported number of cases is 114 and 33 healthy who live in the home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In the Internet news service, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the dead include four men as well as one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were over 60, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41 and 50.
He also said that two of them were coming from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announces that COVID-19 is a scourge on March 11.
The hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the deaths was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an Internet video announcement, the Bangladesh Highway Minister Obaidul Quarter said that the public transport would be banned for a longer period than that planned, until this coming Saturday.
This ban on public transport had begun on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of important goods -- medical treatment, fuel and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were on March 8, for two people who returned from Italy with the wife of one of them.
By March 19, these three are already justified.
The number of SARS-COV-2 is more than one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of people who suffer from SARS-COV-2 coronavirus passed over a million around the world, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths were associated with COVID-19, disease caused by coronavirus.
This happened on the same day when Malawi confirmed her first illness caused by coronavirus and Zambia had her first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea has said, since Thursday, it is one of a few countries without Coronavirus.
Last day, the World Health Organization carried a guaranteed 1,051,635 cases, including 79,332 cases in just 20 hours before 10 a.m., in the Central European Union (0000 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand coronavirus cases are recorded, related to some 5,90 deaths.
The CBS News reports, quoting a data from Johns Hopkins University, that more than 1,000 deaths occurred at US on Wednesday due to the combination of coronavirus.
Around the world, nations have declared strict measures against the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyan, Moscow's capital, has served as a city's closed block until May 1.
Throughout the world, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians will continue to be paid without work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament has voted to expand the national emergency in 15 days; the vote is made up of 220 votes, 10 dot votes, and one has a vote against this.
Saudi Arabia has the time to return to the home of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the rest of the day; earlier, the time to return home was between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to use a return time between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, has declared that the state has upheld its law of staying at home until May 1.
Stores in Australia have reduced the cost of buying small - room paper in each purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian store Wolworths and Coles reduces its purchase of toilet paper so that one can buy two and one pack from each store in the whole country, in a row.
The ALDI again releases an end of one pack, Monday.
These spaces are displayed as messages on exit, and on the shop Facebook pages.
Buyers have been buying them for fear of COVID-19 if they have to separate themselves.
On Wednesday, Wolworths is again able to buy the toilet paper from those who are brought home to be one out of every order.
These changes are followed by the pre-tribution of the four-voltages on each purchase that was introduced by the Wolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"Coles, in its March 8, media commission, reported that at the limit of the four litets, "" most stores still lack goods after about the hour of their delivery."", and called the need "unequal"", whereas ALDI, in its Facebook post on Tuesday, "and "unexpected."
"Strong" over the previous week, according to the Wolworths Speaker."
A Costaco shop in Canberra also increases the number allowed to be two rolls a week ago.
In order to deal with the shortage, Coles ordered the largest packages for the surgeons and announced the increase in the removal, the Wolworths ordered an extra supply, while the ALDI made a plan of a 3-pounder to be made immediately available.
Russell Zimmerman, the top director of the Australian Reteilers Association, said that merchants are trying to raise a chain, but the limits of the local council regarding the time of the carriage of trucks make things difficult.
He expects the cost of production to rise, as the surgeons try to meet the need, with a few sponges.
On Tuesday, the ALDI announced that because of the rapid release of the chain, some stores are unable to continue with the Wednesday parcel.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Morttimer, a Queensland University of Technology expert, said that stores fill a chain every night.
Note that a small room sheet is a heavy item, which leads to a low number of trophies when it comes to numbers and, when completed, leaves a large space open, strengthening the feeling that it is worshiped.
Coles and Woolworths have an idea [that] if there were many items in the shelves, if the product like small house paper trucks and tractors might [be purchased] and there are more, you could probably reduce fear in the case of Russell Zimmerman according to ABC News.
The inventor of the newly produced public paper Who Gives a Crap said that on the third day they were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Killeex Toleet Tissue, and Sorbet’s Sorbet Soper, insisted that they worked 24/7 to keep the product available, according to a report from News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real - estate firm, reports that some house vendors give free paper to the first person who is in need of preparation in Melbourne, during which a few act because consumers have time to rest because of the long weekend of Labour Day.
A Thursday version of NT News, a Darwin’s daily printed newspaper, installed an appendix with a 9 - page Index intended to be cut and used as a personal paper.
The stores were at first reluctant to set limits, according to the ABC Australia report on March 3 when they said they did not have access programmes.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products also have a higher need, including masskis, tractors, dried food, detergents and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday night a supermarket selling on the British Internet, Ocado was seen to be at the start of Andres's public paper purchase so that it could be two on a 12-roller.
The World Health Organization calls the COVID-19 pandemic
On the third day, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 — a disease caused by coronavirus SARS-COV-2 — epidemic.
"Although the word "the plague" refers to the extent of the disease has been affected, not to the extent in which specific examples are harmful, WHO has shown to care for the need to run governments in action:"
All countries are no longer able to reverse the process.
If the nations do research, investigate, are here, divide, follow after and respond to the control of human movements, says Pedro Adamom Ghebreyus, WHO's Director.
We are deeply concerned about both the alarming and the severest ranges and the lack of movement on the levels of shock.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, who was the former director of the United States's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a disease with no previous comparison."
"He said that, by the notice announced to the CNN in February, "without the flu, there is no other respiratory virus that is followed from its beginning until it is spreading around the world."
"Grebereyes has given the same vision, saying "We have never seen before the plague of the cannavirus."
"You're still going," and we've never seen an epidemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new state of the epidemic follows the WHO’s January's decision to call the outbreak a global crisis for the emergency of public health.
"The U.S. director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases's, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said, "What's left, it's going to be worse."
Since Thursday, the Associated Press has reported at least 126,000 examples of COVID-19 worldwide, leading to more than 4,600 of the dead.
The victims of the 2020 connavirus is the ongoing plague of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the disease acute respiration syndrome cryonic 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was launched in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it was declared the Public Health Emergency for All the Nations on 30 January 2020, and it was viewed as a plague on 11 March 2020.
Since 10 April 2020, the 1,61 million accurate examples of COVID-19 have been reported in countries with 210 borders, leading to 97,000 deaths.
About 34,000 persons remained calm.
The number of examples of extinction has been estimated to be 4% in China, at the same time global from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include heat, cold, and cold.
Problems may include pneumonia and acupetary stress syndrome.
The time of exposure to symptoms usually lasts in five days, but it can range from two to fourteen.
No known cure or treatment can conquer the virus.
The principal treatment for symptoms and helpful care. High safety measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping your distance between others, and keeping yourself away from people who suspect that they may be in danger.
The authorities around the world have now responded by limiting travel, division, movements, safety measures on the workplace, and land control.
The plague has led to severe economic and social upheavals worldwide, reduction in sports, religion, politics, and cultural developments, as well as to a shortage of emergency items.
Schools, including universities, are closed worldwide or in 193 countries, affecting 99.4 percent of the world’s students accurately.
False information about the virus has spread on the Internet, and there have been cases of racial prejudice and discrimination among Chinese peoples, other people from the East and the descendants of the Far East, and the appearance of the Far East, and others from the oldest with many examples of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel rates and the closing of large industries, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon dioxide.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (Hubei's capital) reported a series of cardiological examples with unknown origin in 31 December 2019, and a survey was opened at the beginning of January 2020.
Many examples have been related to the Huanan Seawood Wholely Market, so the virus is caused by the development of an animal.
The virus that caused an outbreak is known as SARS-COV-2, a new virus that is closely related to the batconaviruses, pangolin cornaviruses, and SARS-COV. The first known person who showed symptoms was later found to have begun to be ill in December 1,2019, and that the person never had a clear connection with the wet network.
In the first series of examples reported in December 2019, three parts were found joining in the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unprovable report from the South China Morning Post recommended that the following example follows in 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old person of the Republic of Hubei, may be the first. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as new examples are reported slow down in China but they are growing by chance in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new examples outside China and then have passed the number of new Chinese examples for the first time.
There may be reports under examples, especially among those with short - term symptoms.
By 26 February, small examples had been reported among young people, those who saw 19 and below create 2.4% of the world's examples. The chief science adviser for the United Kingdom's, Patrick Vallannce, was imitating 60% of the British community will need to be included in order for the Effective hemunity to be achieved.
Examples refer to the number of people surveyed for COVID-19, and their tests confirming the reliability in accordance with the legal procedure.
Since March 23, no country has considered more than 3% of its population, and most countries had laws to avoid a study of those with simple symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, until 23 January, 86% of the COVID-19 link had not yet been found, and this unwritten link is the source of 79% of written cases.
Statistics published on March 30 estimated that the number of entry figures in Italy are much higher than reported cases.
The first estimate of a simple number of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that it may be 5.7.7.
Most cases with COVID-19 are improved.
Those who do not recover, the time from the appearance of symptoms to death is between 6 days and 41 days, most commonly 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, the deaths of at least 97,000 were put on the basis of COVID-19.
In China, since 5 February about 80% of the dead were more than 60, and 75% are already having health problems that include heart disease and diabetes. Official mortality rates for COVID -19 normally refer to people who have been tested for COVID by a legal procedure.
The true number of the dead of COVID-19 may be very large, since it does not include everyone who dies without checking -ib.
A meta metastasis from Italy found that the number of deaths during the epidemic exceeded the official death rates due to COVID by 4-5x.
"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know" that the [sended number of deaths] is measured in proportion", a term that corresponds to the annual census reports in the U.S.S. U.S.. U.S. system is common in case of epidemic, such as H1N144 is common in 2009. The first death confirmed in Wun on 9 January 2020.
The first deaths that took place outside China itself took place in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China itself, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and places had reported death, in all continents except Antarctica. There are several measures often used to calculate the mortality rate.
These numbers vary from place to place, and are influenced by the extent of the study, the state of health care, the nature of medical care, the nature of treatment, the time since the onset, and the social factors such as age, sex, and general health. The dedath-to-to-case Ratio indicates a number of deaths in a number of examples studied during a certain period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the Global Death Death-to-case Ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) since 10 April 2020.
The number varies from place to place.
In China, the ratio of endath-to-cassio dropped from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 =10 January 2020) to .7% (for those who have symptoms of 1 February 2020). Other measures include case fetality rate (CFR), which shows percentage of people who die from disease, and infR form of infR (IFR), which shows the percentage of infected (not diagnosed and undiagnosed) death.
These figures do not depend on time and follow the number of individuals from the tip of the pattern.
Many highly educated people tried to calculate the figures of certain people.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidance-Based Medicine estimates that infection factority rate is between 0.1% and 0.1%.39%.
The high ratio of this level is accompanied by the results of an informal COVID-19 survey in Germany, and a study of statistics that analyzes the results of CFR estimates.
WHO asserts that the epidemic is not controlled.
The true height and height of an eruption are uncertain and can vary from place to place.
"Miciej Boni of Penn State University said, "If left unsupervised, the inter-connected outbreaks are reduced and begin to decrease when the disease is lost by the preservers we can find."
"But it is almost impossible to make up the current guess about when that will be."
"Chong Nanshan said "it is possible to end by June" if all countries are going to act to follow WHO's precautions to prevent the spread of infection."
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharki of the London School of Hygine & Tropical Medicine said that SAFS-Cov-2 "will go around, vigorously for one or two years."
"According to the study of Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical separation and other steps will be required "until the solution (by bathing for 18 months or more)."
"William Schaff of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus [“because the coronavirus is easily passed off forever" may also be "it becomes a period of seasons, and it returns every year."
The return leap will depend on the strong protection of the flock and the degree of changing them
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be negative in some cases and non-invasive people may have no symptoms.
The most common symptoms are heat (8%) and dry coughs (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, constipation, dyslegm, shortness of breath, shortness of breath, muscle and joints, pain of the throat, headaches, colds, vomiting, vomiting, hemoopysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO has stated that 1 person in 6 is seriously ill and has a respiratory problem.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list showing symptoms such as respiratory distress, persistent chest pain or depression, persistent coughing, difficulty in waking up, and a green face or lips; rapid medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The development of disease in this may lead to a serious case of pneumonia, avate respiration syndrome, septic shock, and death.
Some of the victims may have no symptoms, no medical symptoms, but their research results confirm the transmission, so researchers have suggested that those who had close contact with those who have been confirmed must be noted nearby and be wiped to ensure that there is no disease.
Chinese equality with non-marked zero range is from a few to 44%.
The general warmest period (the period between the frequency and the occurrence of symptoms) is from one to 14 days; generally five days. For example, to measure half of the cases of COVID-19 people who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and later down to 15%.
Other details about the spread of disease are still considered.
The disease is believed to be spread primarily during close contact with small droplets that form when you cough, sneeze, or speak; when the contact close to one another is about 1 to 2 feet (3 to 6 m).
Studies have found that unsupervised coughs can lead to a distance of up to 13 feet [4.5 m] (15 m) to 8 feet [8.2 metres (27 m]).
Some have suggested that a virus may be transmitted by a tiny, short - term microorganism, which can be present during speech. Seconds can also be formed during respiratory emissions, including when you speak, even though the virus does not usually travel through the air.
Mollusks can sit in the mouths or in the nostrils of people nearby or may even be sucked into the lungs.
Other medical procedures, such as introphysics and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause respiratory desalination and result in a loss of air.
It may also disappear when someone touches an infected area, which includes the skin, and then touches the eyes, the nose, or the mouth.
Or there is concern that it may be on the increase, a danger believing it is low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of the transmission of the SARS-CV-2 virus by touching the mouth after contact with the sewage. The virus has an increased risk of infection within the first three days when symptoms occur even though the spread may occur before the outbreaks and the final stages of the disease.
People were diagnosed with a virus up to three days before symptoms appeared that indicate that transmission would occur before major symptoms were developed.
Only a few reports of no examples have been verified by the shown laboratory, but unmarked transmission has been conducted by some countries during a follow - up survey.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while the spread of the disease is not clearly clear, one person usually infects the other two or three. The virus continues to survive for hours to more than things.
Pointedly, the virus is found until three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 in a starles model, one day on the cards, until four hours of copper.
This, however, is different from the temperature and temperature. Home animals and other animals who have believed have actually been found with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals are able to transmit the virus to humans, even though British mosquitoes command man to wash his hands after touching animals, as is the case after contacting infected people who may have touched them.
The Severe avate respiratory disorder coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people who had pneumonia in contact with a group of respiratory symptoms in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the new SARS-COV-2 virus occur in the natural environment of coronaviruses. Without the human body, the virus dies with the home nails, as it melts its external defenses.I SARC-COV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-COV.
It is the result of the source of contact from animals.
Genetic research has revealed that the coronavirus naturally joins with the Betacoronvirus, subtypes of Sarbecovirus (line B) and the sub-division from bats.
It is the same as 96% for the total amount of samples of other bats. (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is a single amino acid that differs from certain chemical elements between bacteria from pangolins and those of humans.
All the combinations until this day have been found that it may be 92% of the original elements between the pangolin and SARS-COV-2, which are not enough to prove that the pangolins are not the middle maintainers.
The transmission of the virus may be obtained by seeing the signals, although the final confirmation appears at last by converting a transmerase effect (rT-PCR) to a compressed or CT image.
The study that compares the PCR to the CT in Wuhan has raised that CT is much more sympathetic than PCR, although its appearance is low, since many of its images are grouped in other types of pneumonia and disease.
"From March 2020, the American College of Radioology recommends that "CT should not be used for investigation or be the first test of COVID-19"."
The WHO has published countless RNA checks for SARS-COV-2, first published on 17 January.
Tests use positive-time transfer.
A test can be made either by breathing samples or by blood.
The results are often found within a period of several hours in days.
The test is usually performed with a soopharngeal sappalyal, although the swab of the throat can also be used. A number of rubbers and companies promote natural piercings, which are able to locate antibodies.
Since April 6, 2020, none of these have been advanced as well as sufficient to be permitted to be used everywhere.
In US the automation process developed by Cellex is permitted to be used with emergency situations only with certificates.
The characteristics of the visual characteristics in radiographs and computerized tomography (CT) of the people who display symptoms include asymmetric periphere fields white pages of glass and absection properties.
The Italian radic Society combines the standard online databases to be found by supported models.
Because of concern over other diseases such as adenovirus, taking photos without the assurance of PCR is limited to pointing to COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the effects of CT to that of PCR and showed that although the image has a small degree of definition, it is faster and more sympathetic, which raises the idea as a test tool in the pedemics of the plague.
Contextal superusers are built on anti-incompressants so that they can check the IUD images with both radiographs and CT.
Tactics include keeping the whole body of personal hygiene, washing the hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or coughing with a sheet of paper and putting it directly into the trash.
Those who may already have received a discharge are urged to wear a face mask in public.
Also, steps that can be taken to protect one another’s physical well - being are encouraged by numerous governments, which have placed restrictions or warnings against an even greater cause for the existence of an ethnic group.
The virus, however, has reached the point where it has become a widespread public health problem in parts of the world.
This means that the virus is still active in communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how to get it, health - care workers who care for someone who may be infected are encouraged to use a fixed method of alert, alert to contact, and protect the eyes. Following the victims of the health authorities can see the source of intersects and prevent further transmission.
The use of the location from the nose from the government for this purpose has removed the concern of privacy, the Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations produce a statement requiring limits in this view.
There have been various anti-netic anti-exportsed, and since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen professional teams have worked on joint and private solutions, such as using Bluetooth to install the user's socialisation to other kiolets.
Users can now receive a message when they are close to someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. There are conflicting theories of methods of prevention; for example, cleaning the nose and resuscitation with the mouswash does not work.
There is no known cure for COVID-19, although many organizations work on building it.
Hand washing is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially when you come out of the toilet or the joints appear dirty; before eating; and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezes.
The reason for this is that outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, since it spews out its protective nose.
The CDC also encouraged the use of an alcohol-based santizer at least 60% of alcohol in volume if soap and water are not available at that time.
WHO urges people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Areas can be contaminated with a few solutions (between one minute of exposure to infection instead of stariles chain), including 62–71% of ethanol, 50–100% of ishopal, 0.1% of sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% of hydrogen peroxide, and 0.5% of salodone-iodine.
Some solutions, such as mebaalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, work at a low rate.
The CDC recommends that if the COVID example is blamed or confirmed in such places as office or day care, all places such as offices, toilets, public facilities, virtually operating systems such as libraries, screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM devices that patients have used, must be killed.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a cough or a noose when coughing, or sneeze, and then quickly throw out any spade.
The operational masks are held in high esteem to those who may be in danger, since wearing a mask limits the amount of air pressure and the range of breathing gums coming out when speaking, breathing, and coughing.
WHO has published guidelines for the time and way to use the mask.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a viologist at the University of Leeds," "Masking may reduce the tendency of people to touch [] the face, which is the main source of outside the proper handwashing. "The Maasski is also encouraged to be used by those who care for someone who may be ill."
WHO has recommended that non-patients wear masks only if they are in high risk, such as those who care for COVID-19, even though they acknowledge that wearing makeup can help people avoid having face contact.
Many countries have begun promoting the use of masks.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing a cloth mask rather than a health measure. China directly recommends that sick members of the community use discarded health masks, especially when you are close at least three feet [3 m] or less) with other people.
Hong Kong encourages wearing a surgeon mask when carrying public transportation or sitting in full - fledged areas.
The health personnel in Thailand's people encourage the making of masks in their homes and clean them all day long.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have officially closed their way through the community without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, the Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask when he went to public places to protect himself and others.
The Austrian government insisted that everyone entering the restaurant should wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear a royal mask while in the community.
Taiwan, as it has continued to produce ten million sacks a day since the middle of March, has asked the passengers and city buses to wear their face masks on April 1.
Panama has made it a challenge to wear face masks whenever you go out, at the same time encouraging you to build a face mask at home for those who can't afford your face masks.
Its face masks were widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Isolation (also known as physical isolation) includes steps to control infections intended to increase the spread of the disease by reducing contact close contact with people.
Roads include separations; travel limits; closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, mattresses, and shopping centers.
Individuals may be able to use social means by staying at home, taking the initiative to visit, avoiding clutter, not greeting one another without contact, and keeping physically separate from others.
Many governments are now pressuring or encouraging social Disstancing in those areas that have been affected by the plague.
The high number of meeting organizations raised by the US government and health organizations was suddenly reduced to 250 people (if there were no extent of COVID-19 position) were put in 50 people, and later reached 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany officially closed a community gathering of more than two persons. The aged and those with present health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, asthma, and stroke, and stroke soldiers faced the risk of serious illness and problems and the CDC warned them to stay in the homes as much as possible in the host areas of the plague. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health branches began to use the term ‘ physical separation ’ instead of that ‘ separation by living together, so as to make it clear that the goal of physical interaction at the same time is to be maintained in a relationship with each other.
"The use of the "isendment" field, and then leading to the conclusion that people must have a full share in social isolation, may encourage them to continue contact with others in different ways. Some authorities have issued guidelines for sexual health that can be used in the future.
These include the urgings to have sex only with a roommate, who is free of the virus or the symptoms of the virus.
The separation in the home is encouraged by those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who suspect that they may be infected.
Many governments have imposed strict restrictions on home living conditions, and many governments have imposed or even promoted restraints on anyone living in affected areas.
The most heavy guidelines for closing home have been passed on to those in the most vulnerable groups.
Those who are likely to be exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently visited the country or the region that will have more extensive communications were encouraged to close for 14 days from the time it is likely to be the last attack.
Tactics to control the epidemic include closing or suppressing, and reducing them.
Conservation is followed in the initial stages of the epidemic and is intended to search out and separate those who are infected and that other anti-invasive programs are opened to prevent the disease from going away to other people.
If it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are being made to reduce it: steps to increase its spread and reduce its effects to health and public health care.
Both steps of closing and cutting down can be followed at the same time.
Pressure requires extreme measures to reduce the epidemic by reducing the easy birth rate to less than 1. The part of treating the outbreak of a infectious disease is to try to reduce the top of the epidemic, known as slowing the line of plague.
This reduces the risk that health services are found to be frustrated and allows more time for medicine and solutions to be built up.
Prescriptions of drugs that can control eruptions include personal protective steps, such as handwashing, masks, closings, public steps that are intended to separate physically like closing schools and contributing to public events; participation in promoting public acceptance and participation in such practices as such; and so natural measures such as cleaning the environment. The most rigid measures to prevent eruptions were taken in China when the size of the eruptions is clear, such as closing the cities, and forcing the rules that prevent visits.
Other countries have also found different measures aimed at restricting the spread of the virus.
South Korea closed the public view and made intercomments, and gave warnings about the movements of those in the affected.
Singapore is vulnerable to financial support for those who are trapped and forced by high wages for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of your face masks and imposed the penalty for the abuse of medical equipment. A study of Great Britain and the U.S. state shows that reducing (to slowing down but not to stop the expansion of the epidemic) and stress (resisting the growth of the epidemic) has serious challenges.
The main reduction laws may reduce the serious need for health care by 2/3, but the end result to hundreds of thousands of deaths and disorders of health programs.
The pressure may be better but needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to surround human society (or until a solution comes first, if that comes first), as exchange rises quickly when steps are taken free.
Long - term intervention against the scourge costs society as well as the economy.
There are no specific drugs to fight COVID-19, but efforts to build them are on the way, including testing existing drugs.
Obtaining medication from stores, taking liquids, and rest may help relieve the symptoms.
Depending on the weight, the treatment of the air, the injection of water, and the support of breathing may be necessary.
Using steroids may undermine the results.
Many elements that have been authorized to work on other growing diseases are being studied to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
"WHORE also issued that some of the "old and home's" remedies" are capable of having relief from these symptoms of sARS-COV-19.
To raise the strength and balance of health care according to the need for COVID-19 patients is raised by WHO as a serious action to respond to the outbreak.

A study of the repierary coronavirus range of 2019 Covid-19 and the SARS-COV-2 virus related to it include the means of detecting the presence of the virus and those who see the antibodies as a result of a human intervention.
The presence of viruses in frames confirms RT-PCR that detects the presence of Cronar - RNA.
is designed particularly to monitor the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
It is used to confirm the latest or current diagnosis of disease.
An antibodies, siology, can be used both for a person's diagnosis or for the management of a unit.
Antibody studies show how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too small to be reported or without any symptoms.
The exact number of deaths due to this disease and the extent of the public’s inequitableness can be found in the outcome of this test.
As a result of estimates, by the time of March 2020, no countries had a reliable number of virus spreading in their communities.
On 23 March, no country has studied more than 3% of the people in their countries and there is a significant difference in the number of surveys that have been made in various countries.
These differences may have a profound effect on reported death rates that may have jumped from some countries.
With the use of a re-time transfer of polymerase, rt-PCR, this test can be done on reppiory frames found in various ways, including a human-time stab or sputum.
The results are usually found between two hours and 2 days.
A study called RT-PCR made by swab throats can be reliable only in the first church of disease.
In the future, the virus may disappear from the throat but continues to increase in the lungs.
For people who have a virus tested in the second week, another stratial can be removed from the depths of the steaming system by the removal of the cattheter or by the coughing of the meterial, sputum, can be used.
Some of the first PCR scans were developed in Crite in Berlin on January 2020 using a positive-time translation of polymerase direct action,ERT-PCR, which provides the basis for the spreading of 250,000 fasts by the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom had also developed a method of testing on January 23, 2020. The South Korean Kogenebiot company improved the PCR-based SARCOV-2 study on 28 January 2020.
"I-Egene" the same in all beta coronaviruses and RdRp genes that are found only in SARS-CV-2. In China, the BGI Group was one of the companies that received the crucial approval of the National Products Administration in China using the PC-B-Base SAV-CO2. In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, broadcast the 2019-Nive Cornavirus, 2019-R, Nol-R-RPl Dial Dial Dial Dial in the course of research on the Department's Department of Health.
Three of the traditional genes test methods of the kits produced some unclear results due to poor CDC tests in Atlanta, resulting in less than - 100 shocks a day that won the whole February 2020.
A survey using two parts was not found to be reliable until 28 February 2020 and until that time when the provincial and local survey centers were allowed to begin.
This method of testing was authorized by Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authority. Self-exports began to investigate at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020 the LambCorp announced the nationalisation of COVID-19 assessment based on RT-PCR
The Queen Diagnostics likewise conducted a COVID-19 study from 9 March 2020
No mathematical limits have been announced, the gathering and processing of Specins should be done according to the CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 was improved and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR
On 11 February 2020 this test was registered by the Federal Service for Survey in Health. On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a type of COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, the Roche Diagnotics obtained a FDA for a test type of 3-.5 hours in doing so allowing one computer to make a study of 4128 hours 24 hours.
In 19 March 2020, the FDA has released the Abbot Laboratorys permission of critical times, EUA, to investigate the Abbott m2,000, FDA has given Hologic, LabCorp and Theor Fisher Scientific.
On 21-March 2020, the Cephed alike finds EUA with a FDA form of testing that takes about 45 minutes.
FDA has allowed the type of testing using isthamal nucleic acid spirituality instead of PCR.
Because this does not require a series of temperature and temperature cycles, this type can provide postitive effects in five minutes and negatives in 13 minutes.
At present there are about 18,000 machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to raise its performance for some 50,000 daily tests. A study using amonocyl antibody that adheres exclusively to nucleopsid protein, N. protein, non-nvel connavirus is developed in Taiwan in the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes like influenza.
"Repetition of March 2020 concluded that the "" radioographs are of little help to the first paragraphs and that the CT, computer tomography, may exist before the symptoms of the disease start."
Common aspects of CT include bilateral multibar group-grand-glas epacifiities with peripheral, asymetriceposteritor District.
Subpletal comination, crazy paving and console grows as the disease changes itself.
A survey that compares the PCR to the Wuhan area where the plague started suggested that the CT is more sympathetic than the PCR but has no details, many of which are compatible with other pneumonia and disease procedures.
"By March 2020, the American College of Radioology encourages that "CTs may be used for first COVID-19" by March 2020, the CDC encourages PC in the first death."
Part of the immunosconsence in cases of disease is the production of antibodies including Igm and IgG.
These can be used to test the existence of disease from 7 days or more, for the appearance of non-invasion and public employment. Asssays can be made up for major test centers, CLTs, or post-of-caring, PCT.
The high level of the automatated systems in most medical research centers will be able to work with sterility, but their availability will depend on the vine for the production of each of them.
With CLT, only the peripheral blood is used normally, although a serial serial is not used for the reactions of the body's soldiers.
By PCT, a single blood specimin is usually obtained by a tanning of the skin.
In contrast with PCR methods, shooting action is not necessary before the Internet. In 26 March 2020, FDA introduced 29 names that reported this act as a necessity and are now able to spread their antibody test.
According to 7 April 2020, only one method of testing was allowed by the FDA under the supervision of critical conditions. Toward the end of March 2020, the Euroimimium Medical Laboratory Diagnos and Economics received the approval of its European satellites who could check to see the IG and IGA antivirus in blood cells.
The amount of testing is several hundred frames within an hour and is much faster than the Vial RNA.
The presence of antibodies is usually measured after 14 days of infection. In April, the UK found that none of the antibody stats could be useful.
"In Hong Kong there have been a disaster in which patients are accused of being in the home," "a crisis trial which will give the patient a specimen  van"", so that they can push it back, and get the results after a while. The British NHS announces that it begins a program of home investigations that the patient will be able to assist others if they go to the hospital or need to clean up the patient's disease if it is available. Concerns about those who are accused of illness at COVID-19 vehicles, a health worker will take the use of appropriate treatment."
South Korea has helped South Korea to make a more rapid, much - focused study in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statatory Health Insurance Physicians spoke on 2 March, stating that it had a commission involving about 12,000 studies per day on the mail schedule and a survey of 10,700 had been conducted in the previous week.
The cost is borne by health insurance when the doctor calls.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the power to include a survey of 160,000 each week.
Since March 19 a study of driving was given in many large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of surveys conducted by Germany had been unknown, for only true results have been reported.
"The first study of the laboratory showed that from the 12/2020th week of the calendar, a total of at least 483,225 samples were examined and included only 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) during the survey she confirmed the SARS-CV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rams Hospital and tested how to test samples for 64 patients at the same time, by including only more when the combined sample indicated. The Whandododo-kidor-me of the test of the "Ha" is "Ha" or "Ha" (Fa) in the text "Ha" (Fu), with "Ha" (Fyu) in February20).
Since the project was still under siege by the BGI founder Wang Jian and took up 5 days, the simulation shows that the examples in the Hubei would have been up by 47% and the appropriate cost of meeting the detention would be doubled if the capacity to include the study was not available at a time.
The Wuhan Lab is quickly followed by the Huo-Yan libraries in Shenzen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities throughout China.
From 4 March 2020 the total of the day’s transmission is a study of 50,000 daily. The open source, the intricate drawings released by Origami Assys are opened to enable them to test many patients samples to 1212 of COVID19 using only 93 assies. These simulations can operate in small amounts without the need for wet robots.
Since March, the shortage and adequate number of receivables has been a major factor in measuring the majority between the EU and the UK and the US.
This led some authors to examine the legal methods of setting samples that involve burning samples at 98 °C (208 ° F) for 5 minutes in order to free more RNA elements. In March 31 it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now studying their more people in view of Coronavirus each head than in any other country, and they were walking with a good foot in climbing the degree to reach a large part of the population.
"This has been a combination of combinations to include the power of driving, and to buy a platform-style mass-through-thrount laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on "Huo-Yan" in Chinese).
It is built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to guide tens of thousands of checks by RT-PCR on a day and the first in the world of this working level outside China.
Various methods of testing for different types of coronavirus were built in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization chose a German system for the construction of the slot machines that were sent to countries of limited financial means without their own construction services.
The German policy was published on 17 January 2020; a policy established by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not found until 28 January, it delayed the study found in the U.S.A. China and the United States to cope with the security problems of research vehicles at the beginning of the explosion, and these countries and Australia were unable to build enough helicopters to satisfy the need and encourage health experts.
In contrast, experts say that the wide availability of surveys in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The capacity to include analysis, especially in independent libraries, was built over a period of many years by the government of South Korea.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the giving of test methods as the best way to implement the infection COVID-19. The high need for screening due to the spread of the virus caused the concentration of hundreds of thousands of workers in the U.S. libraries independent, and the removal of Sabs and chemical reegrees distressed.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its research tanks.
In the United States, CDC scans are found "with some errors" the government removed the law walls that prevented private investigations. Spain bought tickets from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioey Biotechnology Co Ltd, but discovered that the results were wrong.
The company explained that the consequences may be the result of a poor judgment of collecting samples or of using earrings in a proper way.
The Spanish Ministry said that it would release the ticks to produce the wrong results, and it will replace them with the Shenzhen Bioey. 80% of the Czech surveys that the Czech Republic purchased in China yielded the wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test tickets in China that were found to be correct.
"Prime Minister Matovič recommended that he be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry has said that Turkish checks in China were found with "a high degree of errors" and never "used." "UK bought 3.5 million test tickets in China but at the beginning of April 2020.
The survey, followed by the arrests of those who were found to ensure that they were checked and followed by those who had contact with people who indicated that they should be sure of the SARS-COV-2, and the results were also to be verified.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vla, the first COVID-19 death site in Italy, conducted a general survey of 3,400 people, at least ten days away.
At least half of the people who went to extremes during the survey had no symptoms, and all the examples found were locked up.
As the visit is over, this removes a completely new link.
In pursuit of enthusiastic victims, the incoming visits have been introduced, tested, and banned, the 2020 Coronavirus epidemic in Singapore continues more sweeter than other developed countries, but without difficult limits such as the closing of food stores and other commercial markets.
Many events have been clarified, and Singapore began to advise citizens to stay at home on 28 March, but schools opened at a time after vacation on 23 March.
Several countries have also been able to manage the plague with a keen pursuit of contact, inter-trailing, testing, and closing, but to a small degree, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistics have found that more research, compared with the number of deaths, has lower rates of death rates, which may be the reason that they are in a better position to search out those who suffer from severe or chronic symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries with no capacity to include analysis and that they have a national library with limited experience with COVID-19 that send the first and preceding ten valid samples to the COVID-19 of one of the 16 trusted libraries of WHO will confirm the study.
Of 16 reliable libraries, 7 are Asia, 5 are Europe, 2 are Africa, 1 is North America, and 1 is Australia.
In the next chart, the "Visibility % inspection" is influenced by the policy for a country's inspection.
A country that checks only those admitted to hospitals will have more assured of a survey than a nation that examines all its citizens, whether they show signs or not, other things are equal.
Washing hands (or washing hands), also known as handwashing, handwashing with the intention of removing dirt, glass, small objects, or unneeded taps.
Cleaning the hands with soap without delay during those “critical times ” during the day protects the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which combine with oral hygiene.
People can also be exposed to respiratory diseases such as colds or ordinary colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, defiesive features).
Five critical periods during the day when soap washing is important include: front and back after the release, after washing the breasts or cups, before feeding the baby, before and before and after preparing and handling raw meat, fish, or birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, inside, and after preparing the food.
Before and after the patient’s care.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who uses the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing, or coughing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal waste.
Physical hygiene refers to personal hygiene related to medical practice.
Washing your hands before offering medication or medical help may prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The primary purpose of handwashing is to wash the hands of the pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially important for people who carry food or work in the medical field, but it is a routine even for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of colds, canonavirus, and other infectious diseases; to prevent the combination causes of diarrhea; to reduce respiratory infections;
and to reduce the mortality rate of infants in the home.
A 2013 study indicated that advanced handwashing process may lead to less progress during the development of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of young people associated with respiratory and diarrhea can be reduced by starting a simple life - style change, such as by washing their hands with soap.
A simple action can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by about 50%.
Snuffs that promote handwashing with soap can reduce diarrhea in three parts, and this can be compared to cleaning clean water in poor areas.
The decrease in diarrhea by 48% can be linked to the washing of hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is one method that works well and is less expensive in order to protect diarrhea and respirations (ARI), as a normal behavior that occurs in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
The main ARI, led alone as a cause of infant death under five years of age, is destroying the health of an estimated 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia both contribute to the deaths of about 3.5 million babies a year.
According to UNICEF, turning hands into soap before eating and after using the toilet to become a strict habit can save more health than any single cure or medical intervention, determining to die for about half the cause of diarrhea and death from respiratory diseases in one part.
Handwashing is usually associated with other waste disposal interventions as part of the water, garbage and sanitation programs (WASH).
Washing hands also protects against embryosis by direct contact.
A minor accident resulting from regular washing of hands is skin damage caused by dry skin.
The Danish study of 2012 found that excessive handwashing could have a result of swallowing, a leathery skin condition known as skeletal eczema or hod dermatitis, which is most common to people who are not health - care workers.
More frequent washing of hands is also seen as one of the symptoms of opticive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five crucial times during the day when soap washing is necessary to reduce the transmission of disease through oral hygiene: after the use of the toilet (soiling, defecating), after the washing of babies (for changing diapers), before or after feeding a baby, before or after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or birds.
There are times when proper handwashing should be followed to avoid the transmission of disease involves both before and after treatment of cuts or injuries; after a sneeze, coughs, or sneezes; after touching an animal’s dung or handling animals; and after touching the garbage.
In many countries, there is a low level of soap washing with hands.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on the average, 38.7% of families follow the practice of soap washing. The 2014 survey showed that Saudi Arabia had a 97 percent higher rate; the United States near the middle of 7 percent; and China at a very low rate of 23 percent. A few traditional practices are now in developing the practice of handwashing with hand washing in times of crisis. To wash hands as a group of school children at the appointed time of one of the developing countries to focus on children's hands.
The "Esentical Health Care Program" introduced by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the role of child and education.
Twice a year, accompanied by regular washing of hands with soap, daily washing with fluoride, is a pillar of the world order.
It is also successfully started in Indonesia.
Removing microorganism from the skin is also better for soap or water cleaning.
The main function of soap and cleaning is to reduce the solution, and to raise the solubility.
Water alone is not enough to clean the skin because fat and protein, which are soil structures, are not easily dehydrated in water.
But cleaning is helped by the flow of water to a reasonable degree.
Snuff, since it is able to work again, may keep the bacteria from operating earlier.
A small number of studies that monitor the transmission of the virus from a tumor found toxicity conclude that it is impossible to keep bacteria clean and foam at the same time.
The CDC continues that "water soap and handkeeping is better.
Antiviral soaps are widely advertised by health - care professionals.
To this day, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or disinfects is suggested to select natural antibiotic-resistants.
However, antibacterial soaps have normal antibacterial representatives such as triclosan, which has a long list of redestant orchestras.
Thus, even if antibiotic resistant samples are not selected by antibacterial soap, they may be able to work well in the way it is sold.
Apart from the surfact and a defense agent, complex structures may contain acid (acetic acid, acobic acid, calcium acid) as a management of p.H, antimicrobial benzoic acid, and other skin care (aloe erra, vitamin, vitamin, plastics, externals). An extensive study of the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that empty gifts work just as effective as compensumential, antivises with antivises.
Hot water that you can not wash your hands does not burn them properly so that they can die of germs.
Germs grow very much when the temperature of the dam is 37 degrees Fahrenheit [37 ° C].
Yet, the warm, soapy water works better than cold water, which contains soap to remove natural fats that absorb soil and bacteria.
Contrary to belief in a multitude of things, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not contribute to reducing microbial lead in the hands.
Hand sanitizer or the right antiseptic is a representative of water-clean handwashing.
At the end of the 1990s and early part of the 21st century, hand cleaners made of alcohol washing water (also known as alcohol-bod hobs, antiseptic sand rubs, or sanitzers) began to gain popularity.
Many based on isropractical alcohol or ethanol that has been taken together with a hot agent like Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) made a marin, or muctant as a glycerin, or foam to make it easy to use and reduce the flavor of alcohol.
Injecting hydrogen-perixed fluid increases the function of antimicrobials. Hand sanitizers with alcohol 60 to 95% effectively kill germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizer kills germs, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tubculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, Rhinovirus, vivirus, influenza, and hepatitis).
Alcohol rub bits with 70% of alcohol kills 99.97% (3.5 log) by slowing down, as well as 35 decibels by a decrease) infection in the hands by 30 seconds after anointing and 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 pg) of bacteria in the hands at 1 minute after anointing. Handiniters are effective in some bacteria and work slowly on certain bacteria.
An alcohol - based sanitizers are virtually useless to the norovirus (or Norwalk) type of bacteria, the main cause of a cometroteriitis. A sufficient antiseptic or alcohol rub should be used to soften or cover both hands.
The front and back of both hands and back hands and the back of the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or mare is dry.
The fingers must also be washed, rubbed on both hands. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than shaking hands with sanitizers, which is the principal where the hands are clearly fine.
The height in the use of these representatives is due to their simple performance and quick ability to kill micro-organisms; however, they should be used to replace proper handwashing except where soap and water are not available.
A regular use of a sunnitizer based on alcohol can cause dry skin to become dry unless it is inserted with a emolients and/or skin solvents in combination.
The process of angry alcohol can be reduced or completed by inserting glycerin and/or hormones in combination.
In a medical study, alcolotizers based on almollinants make a much better skin and dryer than soap or antimicrobials.
Alergic meet mettatitis, contaminateria syndrome or hyperness to alcohol, or antialiasives that are available in non-Archol hubs.
The lower condition of causing the starting starting of the counteratt deromatis is more attractive than the washing of hands with soap and water.
Regardless of their effectiveness, waterless advocates are unable to wash their hands on the natural elements, but they simply kill germs.
This is for this reason that hand sanitizers do not work as well as soap and water in preventing the spread of many fatogens, as the phategens continue to be in their hands.
The success of non-Alcohols has much to do with all the ingredients and interactions, and in record they are more extremely efficient than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, the combination of subsoil chloride has shown the persistence and increase of the antimicrobial activity after anointing, unlike alcohol, which is shown to reduce working levels after repeated activity, may be the reason for the continuing reaction of the skin.
Many people in economically poor communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or dust.
Dust or soil may be more effective than water, but it will work less than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash gets contaminated by micro-Organisms, it may raise the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also an antibacterial agent because when it is mixed with water, a mixture of alkaline is formed.
WHO encourages ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
The correct hand washing process recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for Prevention of Transmission of Disease include the following steps:
Fill your hands with warm or cold water.
Water is encouraged because standing elevators may be contaminated, while the cold or temperature of the water does not make the difference.
Wash your hands with adequate soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap raises germs in the skin, and studies show that people often do better cleaning their hands when soap is available than when they use only water.
Kill at least 20 seconds.
Steeling causes heat, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and long - term vomiting removes more bacteria.
Clean well under running water.
Washing on the face may cause damage to your hands
You stop with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Drought and soft hands are easy to take for granted the garbage — places that easily forget the thumb, the wrist, the middle of the fingers, and under the nails.
The nails of inserting and cooked polyols may harbor microorganism.
A hydrant is usually recommended to keep your hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can raise the risk of infection.
A small number of inexpensive programs can be made to meet handwashing when tap water and/ or soap are not available. To pump water through an appropriate container or drum and/or use ash if needed in developing countries. In areas with limited water (such as schools or rural areas in the developing countries), there are expensive water-save operations, such as "taps" and other forms of savings.
Sppy-Tap is a simple method of using a ropeed drum, and a foot- ore in which small water is poured into the hands with a soap plate.
Proper handwashing is an important part of the process of handwashing, but there is a debate over the best method of drying in public areas.
A growing number of studies suggest that paper towels are better clean than electrical gases found in the bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was directed by the University of Westminster, London, and supported by the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of hygiene found in paper cans, hot - hands, and the current dry hands of rapidly.
After washing and drying the hands of the hot sun, the total number of bacteria was found to rise at an average rate on the fingers of the hand by 124% and on hand mats by 254%.
A quick metastasis succeeded in an increase in the total number of bacteria in the fingers by 42% and in handts by 15 per cent.
After washing and drying the hands with the paper towel, the total number of the virus falls down on the fingers by 76% and on the fingers by reaching 7%. Scientists are also taking up a study that could reveal if there were any chance of contraband and cleaning services as a result of each method of drying.
Steams, which blow air from them at a fixed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), succeeded in freeing micro-organisms in their hands and nearly adding other users to the cleaning area as much as 20 feet [2 m].
The use of hot air has spread micro-organisms to a depth of 0.5 feet [0.5.25 m] from the chemicals.
The paper towels did not indicate a significant deficiency of micro-organisms. In 2005, a study guided by T ÖV Produkk und Uwelt, different methods of drying were tested.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after the laying out of the hands were noted:
There are many artisans present, and handicrafts have been compared to dryings.
Washing hands using raw sanitinings is another way when you travel on the journey in soap and water.
An alcohol-made sanitizer should have alcohol at least 60%.
Medical washing was long forced after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis received his post (in 1846) to prevent disease in the hospital area.
There are electric generators operated by observation that remind the hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget them.
One study found a reduction in the rate of disease at work.
Medical washing takes about 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or margarine to apply either side of the hand.
The hands must be rubbed together by joining hands.
If there is dirt under the nails, the crystal brash can be used to remove it.
Since germs can stay in water in hand, it is important to thoroughly clean and dry up with a clean towel.
After the dry season, a paper towel must be used to close the water (and open any exit door if possible).
This avoid resuscitating the hands in such places.
The goal of washing hands in the care system is to remove the pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid passing them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that letting go of handwashing continues to be unacceptable in many medical areas, a large number of doctors and nurses continually forget to wash their hands before contacting patients, thus passing on microorganisms.
One study suggested that hand washing in a manner and other simple procedures can reduce the level of catter-reated blood pressure in 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing the system of handwashing and drying in the field of health care.
The directions to the organization for handwashing can be found in its recipes so that the public can observe them.
Replication should be directed by the Whiteby et al.
Stores may be able to measure and ensure hand cleanness, if a reasonable and legal agreement is needed.
The World Health Organization has "five times" to wash hands:
after a blood transfusion
prior to the activity of aeptic, just as
and after the care of the patient. Injecting anti-inflammatory chemicals ("to the medicine" or soaps "resisting microbes") provides the power to kill from this washing of hands.
That deadly force may be needed before surgery or in cases where antibiootic-resistant organisms are common. 'Racing' to someone for the purpose of surgery, it is necessary to have a pump that can be opened and shut without touching hands, chlorhexide or iodine wash, sterile towels towls to dry the hands after washing, and the sterile broile to wash under the feet.
All the jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and arms to the elbow, usually for 2-6 minutes.
Long periods of drag (10 minutes) are not required.
When you turn around, the water in the arm should be blocked without running back into the hands.
After the end of the washing of hands, the hands are dried in a Estherle cloth or a surgical suit is worn.
To reduce the spread of infection, it is better to wash your hands or take hand - to - hand antibiotics before and after treating a patient.
In order to control the hospital’s saphylococial diseases, it has been found that the greater benefit from clean hands comes from 20% of the first cleaning, and that there is very little additional benefit available when resuscitation of hands is raised over 35%.
Washing with empty soap has a three-rate effect of the foodborne disease compared with cleaning up by contaminated soap. For comparison with alcohol-bobbing solution with antibacterial soap and handwashing for a metbial time of 30 seconds.
But soap and water are far more effective than alcohol-bod hobs in reducing H1 influenza A virus and Clostriidium difficile pumpes in the hands. The intervention to improve hand hygiene in health care may include teaching the workers by washing their hands, raising the availability of alcohol-b, and the written and oral reminders to the staff.
There is a need for further research that investigates which of these interventions works best in different health care conditions.
In developing countries, soap washing is recognized as a means of nourishing, an important means of achieving good health, and even physical nutrition.
Yet, a lack of reliable water, soap, or handwashing facilities in people’s homes, schools, and workplaces makes it a challenge to get to the earth’s hands - washing practices.
In many African villages, for example, handwashing pumps near private or public toilets are lacking, although there are no cost - effective methods of constructing handwashing.
Yet, low handwashing may be a more deep - rooted reason than that of lack of soap or water.
Advertising and standing up to clean hands with soap can contribute to making rules, promoting caution with the benefits of handwashing, and leads to a change in social habits.
For this to work, vigilance and follow is essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies has found that social systems play a role in raising hands to the LMICs, while social advertising campaigns are less effective. The one example for promoting handwashing in schools is that UNICEF encourages schools to take simple, flexible steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other requirements of cleanliness.
When smaller levels are reached, schools can range from one to three stars.
Building handwashing can be part of the advertising campaign to reduce disease and death for infants.
The World's Day for Handwashing is one of the examples of the projects that promote caution in an effort to achieve a change of habits. As a result of the 2019-20 Cronavirus plague, UNICEF advertised the widespread use of handwashing.
A few studies have considered the total cost of hand washing in developing countries and relationships and the prevention of DALLs.
One review, however, suggests that soap - washing is more expensive than other water interventions and cleaning.
The importance of washing one’s hands in human health — especially for people under weak conditions such as newly introduced or injured soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the middle of the 19th century by two hand cleaners: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English "prescription of modern beauty."
At that time many people still believed that sickness was caused by the bad odors called maasmas.
In the 1980s, food outbreaks and medical - related diseases led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more hand washing as an important means of preventing the spread of disease.
The outbreak of flu flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 has led to high caution in many countries on the importance of soap washing to protect oneself from this type of infectious diseases.
For example, posters with the inscription "the proper handwashing procedure" are hung up near a sewer in public toilets and private compartments in the offices and airports in Germany.
The expression "cleaning your hands" means to make it clear that someone does not want to take responsibility for someone or to get involved in it.
Its background is part of the Bible text in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands in making a decision to impassioned Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used term in some English societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth's Mackespeare, Queen Macbeth first forced her to wash her hands in an effort to cleanse herself of a reasoned waste, which represents a guilty conscience regarding her crimes and persuaded her husband to do them.
It was also found that people, after remembering or thinking about wrong acts, often wash their hands more often than others, and are more likely to appreciate the importance of handwashing.
Moreover, when they are not allowed to wash their hands afterward they are less likely to share in "cleaning" acts, such as volunteerism.
Religion encourages the washing of hands with both the purpose of cleanliness and symbol. It is a symbol of cleansing of hands, using water but without soap to wash their hands, a part of the practice of handwash’í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netlat dzam in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. It is also a part of the process of washing hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing after using the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam force hand washing before and after meals.
COVID-19 Risk Management Management Management
Risk control controls instead of COVID-19 are the use of obsolational safety and health to prevent cryptic disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper safety controls in the workplace depend on the working environment and the type of work, in support of screening for the dangers of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community, and other risk factors for individual workers who may be weakened in the prevention of COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Organizational Safety and Health Administration (ORH), risk - related jobs have a lower degree of contact with the public and other employees, which are encouraged by simple safety measures, including the washing of hands, encouraging the staff to stay in their homes when they are sick, the good habits of breathing, and keeping the process of cleaning and killing germs in the workplace.
Inflammatory activities include those that require regular and close contact with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but may be infected because of continued social interaction or foreign visits.
This includes workers who can contact the common population like schools, labor unions that are crowded with crowded people, and the market conditions that are high.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to simple protective measures, include high-efficiency agents, sneeze Guards, and personal processes available in conditions where a COVID is found.
OSHA views health and cold personnel exposed to known people or suspected of having COVID-19 as a high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure if the workers perform aerosol-generating services, or carry or carry an apecienses from known people or suspected of having COVID-19.
The appropriate safety control on these operations includes building controls such as negative pressure velocity, and personial processes that are suitable for the job.
the development of the*COVID-19 may have serious consequences within the working environment.
Employees may be unemployed because of sickness, the need to care for others, or fear of exposure.
Marketing habits may change, for both the desired kind of goods, with the means of obtaining these items (such as shopping in less busy times or by being a driver or a driver).
Finally, exports from heavily affected COVID-19 areas may be interrupted. Preparation for an infectious disease and response program can be used to control safety activities.
Programs view the risk factors involved in different workplaces and types of work, including the type of exposure, risks raised at home or in social conditions, and the hazards of individual employees as high age or conditions of chronic illnesses.
They also explain the proper way to handle those dangers, and the following scenarios may well be the result of an explosion.
Preparation for a contagious illness and response programs may depend on the promotion of national or state law.
Reactions include reducing labor in the workplace, protecting people at higher risk of serious health problems, keeping business jobs, and reducing serious consequences to other businesses and stores.
The difficulty of the disease in the community is the business in which it affects the measures taken.
The accidents control steps are the frames used widely in theocuctional safety and health to combine the risk controls with the results.
When the dangers of COVID-19 are not removed, better effective control of building control, followed by control control, and finally the personal safety equipment.
Construction controls include separating workers from work - related hazards without trusting in the worker’s routine, and they can be a step toward greater expense when applied.
The management of changes in the policy or procedures that require the employee or the employer's action.
Personal protocol application (PPE) considers success to be less effective than building and control control, but it can help to avoid some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected on the basis of the job risk, be appropriately dressed as appropriate (e.g., repiretes), wear and, in a manner, be checked, maintained, and changed, according to need, and eliminated properly, cleaned, and kept or left to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Safety and Health Administration (ORH), low - risk jobs have little contact with the community and other age groups.
The simple steps taken to protect the virus in all the workplace include frequent and active washing of hands and hands, encouraging the workers to stay at home when they are sick, good breathing habits that include covering coughs and desalination, diuretics with soaps and ashts, preparation of domestic work or switching sprays, encourage employees to avoid using other tools and tools, and continue to keep the process of cleaning and disinfectioning at the workplace.
The immediate detection and isolation of people who may have been infected is an important step in protecting employees, customers, banks, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with anti-inflammatory symptoms should stay in the home until they can no longer be warm, and other symptoms at least 24 hours without using hot or anti-flammatory drugs, and that the rules of the days of the illness are under threat, allow workers to stay home to care for the sick family member, and that the staff know these rules.
According to the ORHA, the activities of the middle exposed include those activities that require regular or close contact with the six times (1.8 m) with people who are thought to be COVID-19 patients, have the SARS-COV-2 virus because of the ongoing increase in society near the workplace, or because someone has recently returned from the outside world where there is an increased contact with COVID-19.
These include users associated with the general public as schools, high - profiles, and high - market conditions. Establishing executives of these high - risk groups includes putting on high - quality air filterers, raising corporate levels, placing limits such as automation programs, and providing a window for passing through the service service service service. The control of these highly defined work group includes encouraging patients to stay in homes, putting on a vitual control system to replace the face-to-to- face system, establishing a high - pressure approach, which may be more important to the extent of operating systems, including automittering, self-propharpulations, self-inting, self-related equipment, and the use of medical products, and medical products, which are used by the use of blood products, which are used in the use of blood products, which are used by the use of blood products, and drugs, and drugs, which are used in which are used by the use of blood products, and drugs.
The staff on the team of exposure do not usually need to use the repire.
When a person becomes sick in a bicycle, appropriate sleep control programs for the workers and other passengers include distinguishing the sick person from others at a distance of 6 degrees, setting one gang member to care for the patient, and providing face masks for the patient, or asking the patient to cover his mouth and nose with coughing or coughing.
The clepsyche must wear gloves when caring for a sick passenger or affecting body fluids or areas that may be contaminated, and it may be more protective if the patient has fever, persistent cough, and difficult to breathe.
The gloves and other missing items should be discarded with a biohazard bag, and areas that have been found infected should be cleaned and infected later. As for merchant ships, they include merchant ships and other transport ships, control of the canal includes slowing the journey when you are sick, and distinguishing them and informing the treatment center inside as soon as someone starts to start heat or other symptoms while he is on board.
If possible, a follow - up treatment should happen to a separate person. In schools and day care centers, the CDC recommends a temporary closing for cleaning and disinfection if a person with a virus has been inside the school building at any rate.
If there is little or no addition to the community, separation plans are likely to be started as lighting on car stickers, meetings, and other large gatherings such as natural education, education classes or snacks, extending space between desks, arriving in sections and coming home time, having unnecessary visitors, and using a different office of children who have flulike symptoms.
When the virus spreads in a significant way to the public, despite the efforts of people to separate themselves, it may be considered to be a expanded school block. In the day- to-day law workers, the health risk is then viewed as a low by the CDC.
Legislative personnel who must consult with people who are assured or suspected of having COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as health workers, including one’s own safety requirements.
If there is any greater contact when a person is found, the workers should clean and remove the germs from their work belts and clothing before reuse them with a latrine or house cleaner, and follow regular measures to prevent the spread of the virus and the disposal of the PPE used and the washing of clothes.
OVERHI estimates that some medical and winter personnel are at greater or greater risk of exposure to disease.
The activities of those who have been exposed to major risks include those who send medical supplies, relief supplies, viruses, and medical personnel who are exposed to known patients or who suspect that they have COVID-19.
These are the greatest risk of exposure to disease if the staff perform procedures that introduce aerosol, or build up or handle samples, from known patients or suspected of having COVID-19.
The processes that produce aerosol include tube transplants, enzymes, bronchoscopies, techniques and dental examinations, or the concentration of samples.
The activities of exposure to the most dangerous disease include employees who are involved in preparing dead bodies for people who are known or who are suspected of having COVID-19 when they die; these become very dangerous if they check dead bodies. More special units of these dangerous groups include separate rooms for known patients or suspected that they have COVID-19, which include where automation procedures are performed.
A special airway through heavy pressure can be suitable for some medical and cold - temperature satellites.
Samples should be handled with safety guidelines for the Biosophy Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into different waiting centers on whether there are doubts about having COVID-19. In addition to the other PPE, the OSHA encourages helicopters on those who work between those who are six and those who are known, or who have doubts, that they have SARS-CV-2, and those who develop programs that develop aerosol.
In the United States, NIOSH or better than it should be used as a full - written defense system, including a medical examination of health, exercise, and medical examinations.
Some types of repirators can improve and improve the efficiency of the worker. WHO does not encourage the Coverdales, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease not by passing through the body fluids.
The WHO recommends only surgical masks for the surgical personnel in their entrance areas.
For those who collect nose samples, care, or deliver COVID-19 patients without aerosol methods, WHO encourages surgical masks, glasses, or facessed chids, gloves, and gloves.
When the process of developing aerosol, N95 or FFP2 is replaced by the surgery mask.
Because the PPE is not available enough in the world, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telephone contact, physical prevention as shown by the windows, allowing only those who are directly involved in the treatment of a COVID-19 patient, to use only the necessary PPPE on a particular job, continue to use the same recipe without removing it while caring for many patients with the same disease, alerting and controlling the presence of PPE, and restricting the use of physical masks with those who have no symptoms.

COVER: [Covid-19] Reduction and preparation for the future
DAY/FAMILY DATE: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
RATIO: CC0: No privileges set
We find ourselves in a unique position to this month.
COVID-19 is a clear guide for the way in which people in the world are connected to each other.
We have never faced the same challenges, but we know that our reaction to them depends on the kind of worldliness, cooperation, and community development of the organization.
The cooperation and care we have seen in all our employees by e-mail, telephones, and chats is a significant guarantee that we have good people with whom we are privileged.
I am really happy and proud to work with you.
Last week, someone told me how he had appreciated our work.
He reminded me of how logical it is for the world to be able to open Wikipedia right now, and this is a powerful symbol of this most important source that is always available on the Internet and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep an open e - mails or are being paid or our communities are protected.
The world needs the information that can be found in Wikipedia, now more than ever.
Now is the time not only for what we do but also for how we do it, which will have a profound effect on the earth.
Because of the importance of this work and your role in it, we will make significant changes in our relationship with each other from the very next week.
Changes in our work and in the stock market
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team-c has gathered one evening and discussed how we will work with our shed for the days and months to come.
In that discussion, we have considered what we feel will be a positive response to what we are facing and the best way to keep the organization moving forward during this time.
We could expect to get rid of our stress and support for our long - term goal.
If you need to drive again, it is good.
Of all the workers, the companies, and the hired workers:
Our expected daily activity will be about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week until the change is announced.
We do not preach a holiday - if you are able to work longer hours, a company can use it.
However, things are uncertain in the world now, and whether you have to care for your loved ones, buy food, or go to a doctor, your health comes first.
We will not be going to work on your time.
If you are sick, you will not work.
There is no need to say this, but we will.
You don't have to install sick days or PTO - you will simply tell your manager and help your team adjust the calendars and checkouts to ensure that the important parts of the work are being accomplished.
(If it is found that you have COVID-19 virus, please tell Bryan among T&C Ops so that T&C will be able to help you by supporting and ensuring that your condition is properly cared for by the officers).
Workers who work full - time will be fully paid.
We have already said, and we are careful to fulfill our obligations to our employees and those who work in the hours.
Everyone will be paid according to his regular working hours in normal circumstances.
This includes sickness and disability.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to cope with their stress.
What we do can have a wonderful reward, especially in times like this.
Once again, it is important to take care of yourself.
We invite you to contact your supervisor, so that we can know what to expect and plan accordingly.
Some work is taken for granted.
There are things we must do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising (among others) perform some serious task that may require more support.
We will begin the process with every door open to us so that we can examine present goals and turn our attention away from supporting what is important in our goal.
All of us have much to do, and all of us will focus on the most important projects.
Adjusting our pace now will not hurt us later.
We don't plan to work again to hold a elevator when the plague is over.
You would not be expected to work extra hours to complete the job on an unprecedented scale at this time.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work at setting new goals and new times when they are appropriate.
What happens to the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to change our new circumstances and the hour of work we expect every day, we intend to change the sending of our 2020-202 Special Plan.
Our aim is to suggest the development of our 20th-2020s, which allows more time to make a budget for the staff to take priority activities, take care of them, and care for their loved ones while assisting those who need or wish to work a reduced shilling in the next few weeks.
This extension of the work period greatly reduces the present work schedule and the pressure on the rest of the organization.
We will present our request to Bodi the next week and return representatives and grandchildren to the following steps as soon as we have the assurance.
Thanks to the APP team for taking the lead in this.
Office, invasion, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF personnel might be exposed to COVID-19 virus.
Out of great concern, however, we have sent a group that cleans up germs to remove germs from all areas of the San Francisco office.
Use the medicinal soap of the hospitals to remove germs everywhere, as well as the hostel and the evangelization areas that enter our area.
The building uses its ethanol for care by using products that support the safety of its continent.
We feel relieved that the office will be right when we decide to return.
Our DC office is in Werk, which is shared with us its COVID-19 and all the DC workers.
Since last week, our DC office has moved to a remote area that has been fully handled in accord with the direction given by San Francisco.
As our other NyC staff knew, we had been talking about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but may last for some time.
Some of our fellow workers are working far away.
Our long - term servants know that a significant change can be made, and they want to give you advice:
Reduce the length of the meetings by an hour or two.
If long - term meetings are needed, give some thought to how you can separate them during a number of days.
Make it clear that the convention is about you, that you have a travel plan, and that you can send ahead of time things that should be learned.
Do so with video equipment, such as Google Docs and Zoos, to work and communicate.
Have someone take the lead in organizing all the meetings, someone to look up the questions in the discussions, and one to help write notes (or notes all of them).
Send e-mail to those who support technology if you need a good set.
Use your living expenses to buy food.
Sign a #remotis channel on Black so that you can talk to your friends about the work you are sending.
The HR Operations commission requires guidance on Internet networks in effective ways of working to support the increase in the work that is being sent to the entire company.
This past week we asked all who receive back money in the community to highlight the social events supported by Wikimedia, such as etatonics, until WHO announced the end of the epidemic.
We will tell them that we have come to realize that our request for a loan and other restrictions may not make it possible to complete their agreed - upon wages and that no one will be exempt from paying for delays or changing such plans.
In this coming year we will follow further direction on Wikimania and other public and national and national organizations.
The general feeling of society in the world seems to be a lack of frustration over disturbances, but relief by being explained and the opportunities to concentrate on their communities, Wikimedia and so forth.
In time, CRT works to set a page on the Meta-Wiki so that a public space is provided to monitor the effects and then follow up our conversations with them.
Maintaining contact with the COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for the special labor assembly.
We will use the opportunity to share some of these answers with you, to answer your questions, and to spend some time together.
We work together and will help wherever we can.
In the meantime, you can still obtain information about this mail, with all the other key information that is available, COVID-19, in the Office Wiki.
CRTC will keep these pages lined up and all information in the same location.
We also work to keep regular contact with workers living in lands currently deeply affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, work route, service challenge, or anything else you might need, please be willing to tell you and work with CRTC.
We are here to help support and communicate when needed.
If you have a privacy or a serious matter, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judahn - Director of the UNHCR (HR International Global Cooperations).
None of these changes are to be viewed as abandoning our job and obligations.
Rather, it is a realization that at this time, our work and commitments will likely need to be adjusted as never before.
These steps, which believe, are necessary to support one another in the work, to provide our group with the support they need, and to give the earth a function in which you place your trust.
The work we plan to do will be waiting for us when the time comes.
In the meantime, it is a time to support one another and to make room for the important work that may take place in the weeks and months to come.
We want all of you to do that, so we need to take care of you and your family so that you can be fully prepared when the need arises.
Now, we invite you — come along and do not touch your face!

B'Angiotensin-conservative enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an external enzyme (in cellular walls) of cells in the lungs, nerves, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 combats the function of angiotensin-conning enzyme (ACE) by reducing the number of angiotensin-III and increasing Ag(1-7) to make it a promising treatment for heart and blood diseases. ACE2 also serves as an entry into certain coronvirus cells.
The human species of the enzyme is usually referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensun-conservative enzyme 2 is a metalloenzyme that is found on the face of the endthelic and other cells.
ACE2 protocol contains N-terminal resource M2 and C-terminal co-compression arctal amino acid transfer.
ACE2 is a single - cell protein protein, with which the enzyme function in the face of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
An external cell cell cell is separated from the tansmembrane by a enzyme known as the Shedhasse, and the resulting decomposition of the resulting protein is extracted from the blood and eventually results in the urine.
ACE2 is present in a number of body components: ACE2 is linked mainly to the cell cell’s cell II of alveor cells, interrocytes of small intestines, aberial cells and annous endorial cells in many cells.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in cebral cortex, stritum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of the ACE2 is to work as an ACE clerk.
ACE divides the angiotension hormone I into a vascopying angitsion II.
ACE2 distinguishes carboxyl-terminal amino acid phone from angiotyan II (Isp-Arg-Val-Tyl-Tyl-Tyr-Hyle-HE) and divides it into a vassoliatoratoryon (1-7), (H-Isp-Arg-Tyl-Tyr-This-Pro-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also divide a number of other ppptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghelin.
ACE2 also manages the movement of the neutral amino acid transferer SLC6A19 and is linked to Hartnup's disease.
Like the Transmembrane, ACE2 acts as the main entrance to certain coronavirus cells, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-COV (SARS virus); and SARS-COV-2 (COV-19).
In particular, the combination of SARS-COV-COV and SARS-COV2 in the enzyme enzyme ACE2 on the face of the cells results in endocytosis and its movement of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosomes between cells.
This entry procedure also needs to enable Sprotein operated by the Sere Proteasse TMPRS2, a barrier under current screening as a cure for disease. This has led some to conclude that reducing the ACE2 symptoms in cells, can help in combat the infection.
However, many leading institutions and active bodies have encouraged continuing with common ACE prevention and treatment for ARB.
"A systematic review and analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "ACE prevention" was associated with 34% greater reduction in pneumonia risk compared with controls."
"On the contrary, the "Pneunia risk has been reduced to patients treated with ACE which have been at greater risk of pneumonia, especially for heart disease."
"The use of ACE's prevention has also been associated with the reduction of patients who die from pneumonia, although the results have not been much worse than the damage caused by pneumonia."
A human combination of ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a new treatment for severe lung damage, and it seems to promote pulmonary hemodyminics in the release of oxygen from the polylysacharide-induced respiration syndrome.
Half of rhACE2 people take 10 hours to work and begin working after 30 minutes more than your 24-hour (time).
Some research indicates that rhACE2 may be a suitable medication for those who are unable to drink renin-engiotin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or disease when angiotsin II focuses on eating. RHACE2 is studied in medical research for acate respiration syndrome syndrome.
"Anaps eb'COVID-19 are programs designed to help you find numbers in regard to the 20th-20 Cronavirus epidemic, as a method of finding people ( "" affected""") that they may have contact with a person who has been infected."
Several programs have been developed or considered, in support of government legislation in some places.
Frames have been developed for the design of the scanners of the target.
Secret concerns have been revealed, especially about systems based on the direction of the apple users.
Other methods that do not require confidential information include the use of officers in Bluetooth to replace the user in other young ones.
On April 10, 2020, the Google and the Apple announced that they would build a way to support such apples in Bluetooth directly to the OS in Android and OS.
In China, the Chinese government, deals with the Aripay, has developed an ap that allows citizens to examine whether they have had contact with COVID-19 people.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, ap called TraceTogther.
"This application was developed by local IT workers, launched as an open spring and will be given to the government. In North Macedonia there was released "Stop Korona!"", an apple working with Bluetooth for a follow-up for people who might be infected and given immediate response to health authorities."
The apply was established by the Department of Communications and Technology and the Department of Health.
Starting on April 14, 2020, the apply was expected to be authorized by the Google Clay Store and the App Appter.
"On 12 April, the government said that an ap for human identification was at a advanced stage of development, and was to be available for release in a few weeks. A similar apple is prepared in Ireland, and France ("Stop Covid").
Both Australia and New Zealand consider taps based on Singapore’s TraceTogther and BlueTrace. Russia is intended to establish a show-up when a person breaks the limits set for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they are not displaced.
Ross Anderson, a professor of prevention at Cambridge University, lists a number of possible problems with aptics, including misleading warnings and the chances of not receiving a warning if the capacity of ap is limited to a small number of people.
"To resolve problems related to the crowd of applets "inconnavirus" which are false or dangerous, the applet has set limits to the types of organizations that can install a coronavirus in its Appre, stating that it will be only "right" or trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have established similar boundaries.
Secret defense partners have expressed their concern about the problems of mass identity using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the search plan designed to handle the coronavirus epidemic will be disabled when the threat has passed.
The Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement that limits this type of search.
These organizations have set up nine restrictions in government projects:
"Relation should be "right", necessary and appropriate" "
the expansion of the watches and the search should have the circumstances of sunsets;
The use of the data will be limited to the aims of COVID-19;
the preservation of the date and the unknown of words will need to be protected and shown as a defense based on evidence;
a biopsy should avoid lowering the risk of prejudice and diminishing the value of things;
whatever sharing of things with others, it will be necessary to be legally established in the Law.
must be cautious against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
"Stric participants are all "in active" will be required, including local health experts and small groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohne Gren) will also produce test lists.
The proposed Google/Applet program intended to correct the recurring problem by removing a search operations from the OS console where you do not need it.
Some countries were using a network-based inspection rather than amp, which would eliminate both the need for amplification and avoid following.
In Israel, a network-based follow - up was granted.
Network - based solutions that can reach the total of the unsupervised land can have serious privacy problems.
However, not all clinics have large sensors that need to reach a person’s total location; the number of secret - defense clinics has been built using large servers only to communicate (see below).
In South Korea, non-app-based systems were used to track a person.
Instead of using a standard application, the system collects search information from various sources, including the data of following a small dial and card purchase data, and includes this in order to send text messages to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this information to warn people who might be infected, the government has also made available the community’s knowledge available, which is allowable for many changes in privacy after the MERS outbreak of the country.
This information is available to the public with ap and advis. The countries that include Germany are considering the use of both major and private practices.
Since April 6, 2020, details have not been published.
The privacy security system is a well- plan, with many research material from at least back in 2013. Since the 7 April 2020, more than 12 teams of experts have sought solutions for secrecy, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect the user with other young people.
PPP-PT, however, is an attempt to connect both major and diverse ways, and is not a single profile. Various protocols include Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Traffic (DPPPT/PPP-3T), Temporary Contact Numers (TCN, FCN, Fka Contact Evening, CEN), Privacy Principles for Mobile Protocols and MEchanisms for Mobile Contoctocing (PAT) and others.
In these protocol, man’s visible identity never leaves the diadem, and all the combinations do not cause any confusion.
The Privacy Group in MIT Media Lab has been establishing the SafePaths, a platform for use of privacy protection techniques when gathering and using the location or metamer of a crossway to follow the progress of COVID-19.
"It is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Mattuiting Personal Privacy in an Appidemiic" published in March 2020. One similar effort is the Sfeettrace platform of the Enigma MPC, a secret industry that developed for the first time in the MIT Media Lab.
The Sfetrace uses safety technology to allow users to share a serious environmental and health calendar with other users and the legal authorities, without endangering the privacy of the event.
On April 5, 2020, the international TCN Coalition was formed in what has been a very different form with various protocols, with the aim of reducing divisions, and the global use of aps for research and warning, an important factor in general acceptance.
On the 9th of April 2020, the Singapore government announced that he had issued an invitation to the BlueTrace public prosecutor used by its official ampp.
On April 10, 2020, the Google and the Apple, firms that control the small platforms of Andreoid and OS, declared how to track people, and asserted that they would protect privacy, based on the Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography.
They also print the features of the technology used in the program.
In accordance with the Apple and Google, the system is intended to be produced in three stages:
the release of tools to allow governments to create legal apps that monitor the coronavirus
installation of this element directly into the IOS and Andreoid Google and Apple order to correct the problems of starting and continuing awareness by sending the system first with OS reviews, and then removing it in the same manner when the threat has passed.
b'Drug repositioning (also known as re-use of medicine, re-profiling, re-tasking or 19peutic vitching) is to reuse a known medication to cure another disease or health condition different from that developed by it.
This is a form of scientific research currently being done to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment methods.
Other research guidelines include the development of the COVID-19 goal and the transfusion of the constituent plasma. SARS-COV-2 have about 66 proteins that are capable of using medicine, each with a number of social networking sites.
Reviewing the sites in which they are connected constitutes a reasonable program to develop an antimicrobial drug against COVID-19 proteins.

The objective of the B'A COVID-19 is a perceived goal against Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no goal of medical research has ever been achieved, there are many ongoing efforts to find such a goal.
Toward the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was not expected that the objective of the SARS-COV-2, which is the cause virus, could be found less than 18 months.
The five clinics of the Department of Defense Research in April.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
The major outbreaks in the world in 2020, led to a great deal of financial and research work to achieve a goal.
Many organizations use genes to establish possible purposes for SARC-COV-2.
Since April, the key elements of CEPI’s project are fast, cut, produced, and accessible on earth.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that ten different technical platforms had been studied and developed in the early 2020 to form a practical goal against COVID-19.
The main platform operations that developed in class safety I include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Stringster I and goal resolution: Moderna, MRNA 1273)
Aviral vector (integration founder I and the target conference: Can Sinno Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As CEPI scientists were reported in April, 15 percent in the early stages of the project, and 78 were confirmed as disease - carrying devices (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 were declared, but very little of the public information available (perhaps planned or invented).
The IEI section study the safety prior to the use and fighting of the virus, usually not planned, is controlled by a vaccine, and is available in many institutions, while more precise, effective enzymes are considered.
The study of Type III usually involves more participants, which include a control team, and the operation of a target test to prevent the disease, while serious consequences are being handled with the right amount.

In March 2020, the government, industry, and three US universities combine equipment to locate IBS computers, combined with sun computers from the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some goals involve the effect of other living things, which are also called unexplained.
That means they can have far more serious side effects.
One informal study in Australia requires the registration of 4,170 health personnel.
Goals may not be safe or effective.
The first study of the effectiveness of the object is used by animal models in COVID-19, such as a infected ACE2 mouse, other laboratory animals, and human pets, showing the need for efforts to protect the virus from infection, and interaction with other countries in order to ensure safe practices that work around the world.
The goals of SARS and MERS have been studied in animal - less - human models.
Since 2020, no sARS safety strategy has proved to be safe and effective.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of goals and new drugs in treating SARS was a major feature of government and public health services worldwide. And no goal has been found for MERS.
When the MERS surged, it was believed that the current SARS research could provide an effective computer to develop goals and treatment methods for the MERS-COV virus.
Since March 2020, there has been one (DNA) goal (DNA) that completed the MERS Medical research class, and three others are still being studied, and all are the goals ofviral-vectors, adenoviral-vectored (ChADOX1-MERS, BMS-Gam Vac), and two MVA-VARS-Vac.
Ports of the communication areas promote the idea that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and that the goal is already being discovered.
The accounts quoted in the introductions of various chat rooms refer to the already existing genetic codes as well as the goals of some coronavirus relatives such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious virus caused by a sere respiration syndrome disorder 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Symptoms of general illness include fever, cough, and asthma.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, painful throat, bad breath, and stomach pain.
The time from the onset of symptoms is usually five days but may range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in symptoms, some result in a progressive pneumonia and many deaths.
Since 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million reports have been reported in 210 countries and areas, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people in contact, usually by small drops that come out when you cough, sneeze, or speak.
Although the worms are released during breathing, they often fall to the ground or onto objects rather than become germs in longer distances.
Humans may also be infected with the virus and touch the infected area and touch the eyes, the nose, or the mouth.
The virus can live on objects for about 72 hours.
It is most common during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it can spread before symptoms of the disease and later stages of the virus. The usual method of diagnosis is the transmission of polymerase (rT-PCR) by the crocodile.
The use of masks is encouraged by those who suspect that they have the virus and their caregivers.
The public’s suggestions for the use of masks vary, some authorities say that they are not used, others say that they are not used, and still others force them to do so.
At present, there is no specific goal or treatment against COVID-19 virus.
The transmission of the virus has been found in many countries in all six areas of WHO.
Those infected may have no symptoms or symptoms such as colds, colds, fatigue, and asthma.
Symptoms of an emergency disorder include respiratory difficulties, persistent chest pain or depression, confusion, difficulty in getting up, and a green face and lips; encouragement to get a doctor’s help as soon as these symptoms appear.
Strange as it may seem, symptoms related to breathing above may appear as a cough, a sneeze, or a sore throat.
Symptoms of the disease in the mouth from the mouth to the waist, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been shown by various percent.
Some incidents in China started to develop only chest density and heart rate.
In others, the disease can spread into pneumonia, kill most of the organs, and kill.
This is also called the age of symptoms.
The period of symptoms for COVID-19 will usually be from five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms suffer during 11 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these who do not have the symptoms of disease in transmitting it to others is not yet fully understood; however, current evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The number of people who are not infected with the symptoms of disease is now unknown and studied, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected people have had no symptoms during hospitalization.
China’s National Health Commission began to include the cases of non-embroids in her daily numbers on April 1; of 166 infected that day, 130 (78%) did not have symptoms during tests.
Both the cough and the saliva can be infected.
A good conversation produces several points rather than ordinary ones.
Research in Singapore found that coughing without a cover can lead to a walk of about 15 feet [4.5 m] (15 m).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted to the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it can be transmitted by breathing and that air-cushion services outside people's rooms produced a supersonic respirator of RNA virus.
Certain medical procedures, such as the introduction of tubes and cariopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the production of crystals to be released into the air and result in a respiration by breathing.
While concern about possible side effects is not limited, the virus is thought to be very small. The virus is highly contagious when people have symptoms; although the outbreaks may occur before the symptoms of the disease are detected, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet fully clear how easy it is for a virus to spread, one person usually infects two or three people. The virus lives for hours until days on things.
In particular, the virus was found to survive one day on a board, about three days in plastics (polypropylene) and steel (AISI 304), and about 4 hours in 99% copper.
This, however, differs from the humidity and the temperature.
Soap can also serve if used properly; soap products reduce the protective layer of bacteria, kill it, and remove it from the skin and elsewhere.
Some soaps, such as basalkonium chloride and chlorideydine Glucote, do not work properly. In a Hong Kong study, urine samples were taken two days after the first hospitalization.
Of 5 out of 6 patients, the first sample showed a high infection rate, and the sixth patient showed a higher infection rate on the second day.
Asre award respiration syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is the worst respiratorary respiration disorder, starting with the release of three people who have pneumonia and are involved with many of the most serious respiratory infections in Wuhan.
All aspects of the new SARS-COV-2 virus come from coronavirus.
When outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, which releases its protective nose. SARS-COV-2 is closely related to SARS-COV.
The lungs are the most affected parts of COVID-19 because the virus enters the main cells through a enzyme called angiotsunsion-conserving enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is widely available in the type II of alveolor cells in the lungs.
"The virus uses a special glycoprotein called "ispike" (peplomer) to connect with ACE2 and enter the main cell."
A serious heart injury was found in 12% of infected people who were admitted to a hospital in Wuhan, China, and it is more common to serious diseases.
The symptoms of highcardiovascular disease, caused by the swelling of the tumor and by the immune system during the rise of the disease, but serious heart attacks may also be associated with the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are more visible in the heart and are involved in heart operation.
The case of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboemolism (25%) is found in ICU patients infected with COVID-19 and may be related to weak prognosis. A study of people who have died from COVID-19 has shown DI; DAD, and lymphocyte in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a hyperinflammation of ACE2-expressing lung glands, serious COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, the Pathogenic GM-CSF-reating T-cells appear to fit the discovery of IL-6-serting sonocytes and the causes of severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
It has also been reported on lymphocytic insulates during autopsy.
WHO has published a number of biodegradable devices for screening the virus.
A common method of testing is the transfer transfer of polymerase (rT-PCR).
Tests are usually performed in respirator samples obtained from a scaffolding; however, an insulation tube or sputum sample can also be used.
The results are usually found within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two samples of blood taken during two weeks and the results have little value at that time.
Chinese scientists were able to divide part of the coronavirus and print a sequence of nutrients so that viruses around the world could develop their own polymerase scan (PCR) to identify the virus.
Starting on April 4, 2020, tests on the components of a disease (which can detect active bacteria and if a person has already been infected) were introduced, but they have not been widely used.
Chinese studies show that accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States authorized the first diagnosis of treatment on March 21, 2020 that was used at the end of that month. An examination published by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan suggested ways to detect the virus based on the properties of treatment and the risks of control of disease.
Bilateral mutilbar group-Glaslas opacies are spread by peripheral, asymmetric and posteriers are common in infection.
Subpletal comination, crazy paving (the fever of the libular subtal with avarveor gilling), and consulation may develop as the disease progresses.
Little data is available through microscopiic lenses and the COVID-19.
The main causes of the study were the following:
macroscopy: surfacesy, pericardis, lung console and pulmonary edema
Four types of pneumonia bacteria can be identified:
normal pneumonia: pulmonary oidema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, malaria aty chemical pneumocytes, interstatic inflammation with lymphocytic induction and multinulunicated cellular information
critical monitum: dialy alloys (DAD) and dialing anlveolor inverses.
DAD is the cause of acceptary stress syndrome (ARDS) and hypoxemia.
cooked hormone: a mixture of exodates in alveor Caviations and pulmonary interstial fibrosis
Blood: dieselted invascular coagulation (DIC); Leukoerythroblastic reaction
Steps to reduce the risk of infection include staying in the house, avoiding crowded areas, washing hands frequently with soap and water for about 20 seconds, practicing oral and nose hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC encourages closing the mouth and nose when coughing or coughing and encourages using the inside of the rod when the tube is missing.
Proper handwashing after coughing or coughing is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of a face mask while in the public, in part, to reduce the infection from people who have no viral symptoms. Self - contact techniques are intended to reduce contact between infected persons and large groups by closing schools and workplace facilities, preventing travel and crowding.
Distance guidelines also include that people are at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
"There is no known drug that works in prevention of COVID-19. Since the goal is not expected until 2009, the best way to control COVID-19 to try to reduce the number of those with the virus, called "make the line flat."
The CDC also encourages people to wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands appear dirty, before and after feeding, coughing, and coughing.
It also promotes the use of at least 60 %, but only if soap and water are not readily available. In places where hand tractors are not readily available, WHO gives two methods to produce them in the area.
In these ways, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isropanonol.
"Drogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacteria in alcohol; "it's not a virus in hand washing."
glycerol is inserted to create moisture.
People are treated with care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen therapy, and support of other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect that they have a virus wear a normal face mask.
ECMO has been used to solve breathing problems, but its benefits are still considered.
Sanitation, life, and healthy food have been promoted so that you do not become infected.
Physical therapy may help those with mild symptoms who have recently been infected. WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have published suggestions to care for hospital patients with COVID-19.
Inensensivists and Pulmonologists in the U.S.
Since April 2020, there has been no effective treatment for COVID-19.
When symptoms appear, some doctors recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than buprofen.
Steps must be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to another, especially in medical areas, where procedures may produce aerosols, such as intuition or hod ventilation.
For doctors who care for COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping a person in the Airbone Infectious ILOR (AIR) rather than taking normal steps, preventing contact with the invision of the virus. The CDC describes the use of personal protencenceability (PPE) during the epidemic.
The necessary items: PPE pencil, opticor or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. When available, the reperators are encouraged (in place of facial masks).
N95 respirators are authorized to be used in industry but FDA authorizes to be used under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
It is not designed to protect air particles as dust, but the protection of certain body components is not guaranteed in its use.
If tasskis are not available, CDC suggests using different font types or, if there is no other option, automated masks.
Many conditions of COVID-19 are not too bad to require mechanical ventilation or other methods, but some do.
A form of respiratory support associated with COVID-19 is still being studied by hospital patients, and there is some evidence that intubunisation can be avoided by high fever and sal canal canal canal or bi-getl posative disease pressure.
Whether these two lead to the same outcome is unknown for people who are seriously ill.
Some doctors prefer to live with invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this method reduces the spread of inflammatory crystals compared with high fever and sal cannula. Most serious conditions are common among adults (more than 60, especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds, reducing the number of people caused by failure to handle the sudden increase in the number of persons with emergency COVID-19 need for hospitalization.
One study in China found 5% admitted to being exposed to severe illnesses, 2.3% needed ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30 per cent of the hospital with COVID-19 eventually was included in ICU.
Ventilation machines become more complex as the acupitary stress syndrome (ARBS) is developed in COVID-19 and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators with high stress - control techniques and PEEP are required to increase oxygen supply while the risk of damage to the lungs associated with ventlator and pneumthorax is reduced.
APEP may not be found in old Ventilators.
Medical research began in January 2020, and a number of antimicrobial drugs in medical research.
The remidesir seems to be the most effective.
Although the development of new drugs may be due to 2009, several of the testing drugs have already been licensed for further use or progress in testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried for people with a serious virus.
WHO encourages volunteer workers to assist in the research on medical and health care that can be used. The FDA authorizes temporary invasants of blood plasma as a standardized treatment in cases where a person is already in serious condition.
He has not yet taken the needed medical research to prove that it is safe and effective in treating disease.
In February 2020, a small ap was developed in China to handle the outbreak of the virus.
Users asked to enter a name and number of ID.
This application is able to see 'if you are close to a person' using a search engine that could be dangerous to infection.
All users can consider the situation of the other three users.
If a situation appears to be dangerous, ap encourages not only isolation from humans but also health authorities. A thorough analysis of many details through a youth's metamorphosis, face - to - face technology, follow up to the telephone and development information developed is used to transport infected and infected people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the State of Israel authorized a security check to follow up on the host telephone of people who are thought to have coronavirus.
This is done to separate them from the community and to protect those who might be contacted by the infected population.
In March 2020, the Deutsche Telelem shared a network of telephone and German government agencies, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia developed the art of facial expressions to find out who broke the rules of social isolation.
"The Italian health officer Giulio Galera said you were told to the young workers that "40% of the people are still moving."
The German government is running a 48-hour computer for a weekend participants of 42,000.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a national declaration of solutions to the growth of coronavirus.
People may face the stress of living alone, of being restricted, of negative side effects, or of being infected by the virus itself.
"BBC has quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "" continued social isolation, loneliness, concern about health, depression and economic well-being is a storm that affects people's minds and their well-being."
The virus may have minor or minor side effects, resulting in some common respiratory infections, such as a common cold fever.
Normal cases have been treated within two weeks, while those infected with a serious or serious virus can take from three to six weeks to recover.
Women who are pregnant may be at greater risk of the COVID-19 virus on the basis of exposure from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but the COVID-19 is missing. For some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
For those who are most affected, COVID-19 can rise rapidly to accreditive disorder (ARDS) and cause damage to the respiratory, sptic shock or death of most organs.
The problems associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal shock and heart damage, kidney and liver.
Clotting anorritices, especially an increase in prothrobin time, is found in 6% of those who are admitted to the hospital for COVID-19, while damage to the kidney is seen in 4% of the group.
About 20-30% of the people with COVID-19 show high levels of liver enzymes (transamisis).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms of disease and death is ten days, and five are spent in the hospital.
However, patients transferred to ICU have had about seven days between hospitalization and death.
In the study of early events, the average time from the appearance of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, totaling from 6 days to 41 days.
In a study of the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8% while the mortality rate for women is 1.7%.
Rhappathological samples for autopsy of the lungs indicate dicular alkalolage and cellular fibromyxoids in both the lungs.
The transformation of the original cytopic was seen in the pneumocytes.
A pulmonary respiration disorder (ARMS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart damage was noted in higher levels of troponin or heart position.
According to March statistics from the United States, 89% of those admitted to hospital were already sick. The discovery of medical and social factors may contribute to deaths.
Measures of death due to infection vary because of such differences in the provinces, but also because of difficulties in the methods used.
A few of the mild - tempered conditions can cause the death rate to be greater than expected.
However, the fact that death is a consequence of previous infections can mean that the mortality rate is now low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to receive serious COVID symptoms and up to 2.4 times more likely to receive care for an emergency or death compared with nonsmokers. Concern has been expressed about long - term pre - infection.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority has experienced from 20 to 30% decline in lung function among other people who have recovered from infection, and lung disks indicate that it may be damaged.
This can also lead to postpartum treatment after recovery.
In March 2020, it was not known that the past virus can help to provide effective and long-term protection to people who recover from the virus.
Defense against the virus seems to be possible, based on some coronaviruss, but conditions have been reported in which the recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by a subsequent tests of coronavirus.
These conditions are thought to be the spread of the virus rather than the reemergence of the virus.
The virus is thought to be both natural and biological, and it infects humans.
The origin of the cell is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the virus was almost fully led by its transmission from man to man.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 at Lancet, indicated that the first date of the outbreak of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official documents of WHO reported that the symptoms of the first disease were ever present on December 8, 2019.
Several methods of counting death are widely used.
The numbers vary from region to region and from time to time and depending on the degree of research, medical equipment, medical procedures, time from early puberty and other human factors, such as age, sex, and health.
At the end of the 1990s, WHO distributed copies of the ICD-10-10 emergency virus, U.S.1 killed by a proven SARS-CV-2 cable virus and U.S.2 killed by COVID-19 by medical and distributors except for a registered SARS-CV-2 virus. The mortality rate of deaths is different from the number of infected during the given period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the average death rate for the world virus is 6.9% (153,822,240,191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies from one region to another. Other methods include case factority rate (CFR), which shows percentages of infected infected people, and infection factor (IFR), which represents a percentage of people who are infected (non-defiled and undetectable) who die of the virus.
These statistics are not based on time and are followed by a number of people from the time of infection to the remedy of the environment.
Although not all infected ones are infected with a virus, the presence of the virus can provide information on how many people are infected.
In an area where most people are infected in Italy, in Castiglieone d’Addda, a small area of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) is already dead.
In the Gangel, the virus was promoted by Carnival festivals, and it entered into young people, resulting in low death rates, and not all of those who died from COVID-19 are officially recognized as infected.
In addition, the German health system has not yet had the highest rates.
In the Netherlands, nearly 3% may have a component of the disease, as was screening blood donors.
Of 69 (0.004% of the people) are convinced that they have been killed by COVID-19.
The toll of the epidemic and the rate of death varies from that of both men and women.
The number of deaths is higher than men in a study conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for males is when they are 50, and the gap between men and women is close only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The main reasons for these differences are unknown, but genetic and behavior factors may be the reason.
The difference between sex - based viral infections, the low percentage of female smokers and men who develop certain conditions of illness such as hypertension when they are younger than women can contribute to a higher mortality rate of men.
In Europe, 57% of infected men are males, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were males.
In April 2020, the US government does not follow the sex-related COVID-19.
Studies indicate that such infectious diseases as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A high number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the virus will be "COVID-19".
WHO official Pedro Adano Gherebeensus explained that CO represents corona, VI represents virus, D represents the disease, and 19 means the year marked for the first outbreak: the date 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen so as not to be named a specific area (such as China), animal or group of people, in harmony with the proposals of various countries intended to prevent discrimination. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the disease acute respiration cycle coronatory 2 (SARS-COV-2).
"WHO also uses "COVID-19" and "COVID-19" virus" in public conversations.
"both disease and infection are commonly called "coronavirus."
"During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan'coronvirus".
In January 2020, WHO suggested that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCov treate respiration disease as a term to be used for infection and disease in accordance with the guidelines of 2015 against the use of disease and germs.
The official terms COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
As a result of the shortage of products in the production industry, some of the carteers printed medical materials such as moths and entilators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the Ventilator Valve, and the surgeon could not send it at the time required, the local company used its machinery and printed 100 valves in one night.
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, imaginary, false and misleading stories appeared regarding the origin, development, development, prevention, treatment and other features of the disease and spread rapidly to the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to pass on the virus to other animals.
Research has failed to find evidence of the spread of pigs, ducks, and poultry by the virus.
There is no known cure or effective treatment for the disease.
International research on the aim and drug combinations of COVID-19 are conducted by government agencies, schools, and industrial research groups.
"By March, the World Health Organization has begun "FELLED Research" to investigate the effects of the treatment of four drugs that fight the existing virus, with high hopes that they will work."
There is no vaccine already available, but various herbs work to establish vaccines.
The past SARS-COV function is used because SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 use both ACE2 rector to enter human cells.
Three methods of prevention are being studied.
First, researchers plan to develop a vaccine.
The goal of the use of a virus such as this, which is not active or dead, is to develop a body response against the new COVID-19 virus.
The second method, subunit vancers, aims to set a goal that makes the immune system respond to certain aspects of the virus.
If it is in SARS-COV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protocol that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme solution.
The third method is nucleic acid goals (DNA goals or RNA, a new method of building a goal).
The goals that are studied in any of these methods will need to be tested for safety and functioning. On March 16, 2020, the first medical study of this purpose began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The object contains a security genetic code that is copied from the virus that causes disease. The development based on the properties of the disease has been proposed as a challenge to the development of the SARC-COV-2, but this is not guaranteed.
There are more than 300 medical studies continuing since April 2020.
Seven studies were studying the already approved treatment of malaria, including four studys of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Respiratory drugs form a major part of China’s research, and a nineth - class study of the remides of respirator in several countries will send a report toward the end of April.
The major recombination of the medical goals of COVID-19 and non-use drugs had begun, in April 2020. A number of available antimicrobial drugs are being studied in the treatment of COVID-19, including remidevir, chloroquine and hydroxyloroquine,lopinavir/ritonavir, andlopinavir are associated with intertor.
There was tangible evidence for the remidesir operation, in March 2020.
Progress in the treatment of patients that is seen in the use of remidevir.
A medical study of Type III is being conducted in US, China, and Italy. chloroquine, formerly used in treating malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with unauthorized results.
However, the results of research are proposed.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while encouraging the daily average of one gram, notes that amount is twice as high and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued permission to use in emergency situations of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for doctors who treated people with COVID-19. The seven Chinese programme guidelines included interferron, ribabilin or mufernovir in the treatment of COVID-19.
An unauthorized data indicates that high rubber levels are required to prevent SARS-COV-2 from invitro.
Manazaxanide has been suggested in a progressive video research after showing a weak block of SARS-COV-2. Research shows that the first rise of protein priming with tansembra is 2 (TMPRSS2) is the key to the entry of SARC-COV-2 by relationship with ACE2.
Achloroquine and hydroxychloroquine along with azithromycin or without it have large boundaries that prevent the medical community from receiving this treatment without ongoing research. Oselstavir does not prevent SARS-CV-2 from being avitro and has an unknown role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The Cytokin stom may be a problem in the latter classes of COVID-19 very bad.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine can have anti-cytochine storm. Tolicizumab has been added to medical guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a brief investigation.
A study of section 2 which was not planned in the national team in Italy was conducted after showing the devastating effects of a serious illness.
Linked with blood tests of serum ferritin to find cytokines, it is intended to prevent the occurrence of this, which is thought to be the cause of certain deaths of some affected individuals.
Interleukin-6 receptor tendonost was authorized by FDA on the basis of previous research in treating steroids cytokine syndrome caused by various factors, CAR T therapy, in 2017.
Until now, there is no informal, controlled evidence that toyilizumab is effective treatment for CFS.
The transmission of the contaminated and active antibodies produced by the immune system of those who are recovering from COVID-19 to the people they need is being studied as a means of limited immunity.
This method was tried on the SARS and the results were unknown.
Aviral utilization is the expected method used when low - dose therapy can provide protection against SARS-COV-2.
However, other methods, such as cellular cytotoxicity based on the elements of the disease and/or phagocyticosis, are possible.
Other methods of treating the components of disease, for example, using the same cell - containing elements, are developed.
The production of a calcium serum, which contains a blood component from patients who have recovered and who have the antibodies associated with the virus, can be developed for immediate use.
Coronavirus, a group of disease related closely
Li Wenlyang, a doctor at Wuhan's Central Hospital, who later became infected and died from COVID-19 after helping to monitor the spread of infection.
