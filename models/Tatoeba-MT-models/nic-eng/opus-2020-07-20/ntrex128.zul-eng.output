The Menga article gave Livingston at 0 while playing the Rangers
Dolly Mega’s first article won Livingston
The newly raised Livingston's Rager of Steven Gerard is surprised that he accepted his second victory after 18 games as the teacher of the Ibrox team.
Menga’s article became a difference as the Gary Holt’s team rose up and fell apart, so the mebernia slept a second.
Gerard’s team makes a trip to the premiership and will meet the Hears on the summit, leaving them eight points on the weekend.
Prior to this, the Ragers received the Rapid Vienna in Europe the fourth.
Livingston has not yet been won in six games, as trainer Holt has continued to lose since he closed Keny Miller’s space in the past month.
Livingston breaks up the opportunity when he catches up with the lazy visitors
The Holt group must have been very prominent before they could do it, their understanding has caused a lot of trouble the Ragers.
Scott Robinson, having a chance but failed to carry an article about the matter, was succeeded when Allan Lithgow gave Craig Halket his head and stabbed it.
The family had been willing to let the Ringer play before them, since they knew that they could be paralyzed with sets of pints.
And it was the most natural way out of the race.
Ragers made free-kick from Livingston, Dellan Gallagher and Robinson, touching the ball and inserting an article in the middle of the box.
In that season, the Ragers had a game but was not going through the back of the game and Liam Kelly was independent,
The carpet continued on the second floor, or Alfredo Moralose, who tried to have Kelly finished the ball.
Scott Pittman is under ban on Ragers ’ feet and Ragers ’ feet by Allan McGregor and Lithgow left a ball in the Livington slide.
Micros come in a series of Livingston's box, but then it is removed, and there are the press charges — after Halket to play badly with Glenn Middleton, and the rot is completely destroyed.
‘ Well done by Livingston-Muzi
Alaska Lamont from BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
The game is good and the effects on Livingston.
Just as a person, in good fun, they continue to go beyond the expected limits as he climbs.
Their way of playing and their own way has not changed since they returned from the log, but we should commend Holt for the way the group is prepared for the arrival.
He had many champions.
Captain Halket, whose wall is strong, while Menga kept Conn or Goldon and Joe Worroll finished the game.
The Ringers were missing, but.
Or they do well under Gerard’s circumstances, and they have kept that level at themselves.

Hundreds are killed by earthquakes, tsunamis, the number is increasing
At least 384 people lost their lives, many were swallowed up by mighty waves during the attacks of the buses, when an earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian colony of Sulawesi, says the authorities on the weekend.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a feast on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when the 18 - foot [18 m] waves were attacked on the shore at nine o’clock, killing many in their lives and destroying anything along the way.
The tsunami followed the 7.5 - foot [7.5 m] earthquake.
"By the time the tsunamis appeared on Thursday, people were doing their jobs on the coast and did not rush and became victims," says Sutopo Pzuyu Nugroho, who speaks for Indonesia, in an attack on BNPB.
"The Tsunami did not come alone, he pushed cars, timbers, houses, hit everything on the ground," says Nugroho, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at 800 kph (47 mph) before hitting the sand.
Some people ride into the woods to escape to Tsunami, he said.
Some 17,700 people were moved to 24 stations in Palu.
Closed - up flights from the disaster station showed dozens of buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed, and flooded streets collapsed, as well as a water - tossed elevator.
The earthquake continued to shake a coastal town for the rest of the weekend.
A series of earthquakes were known in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Approachation of Technology (BPPT) says that the country’s power to be released by an electric shock on Friday was 200 percent the force of an atom bomb that landed in Hiroshima in World War II.
The city’s geography, which is at the end of a long, small half, may increase the size of the tsunami, they say.
Nugroho described such damage as "big" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls, and fallen hotels.
Other victims were found locked under a broken building tube, which, in addition to 540 persons injured and 29 died.

There are more than 300,000 residents, "the Red Cross in the statement, adding that its crew and volunteers are going to the affected areas.
It is said, "This is already a problem but it’s much higher."
The advantage on Saturday was widely criticized for not saying that the tsunami was attacking the Palu, although the authorities say that the water had arrived at the time that the warning was issued.
The video shared in the community of a man at the bottom of the building may hear the unreasonable voice warning against a tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes the sea walls, which clears buildings and vehicles.
The Reuters people could not immediately testify to the truthfulness of the video.
Earthquakes and tsunami have caused electricity loss and communication in Palu that makes it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
The soldiers have begun to fly from Jakarta and other cities, says the authorities, but the survivors need food and other basic needs.
The city airport is only open to relief efforts and will be completed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palu vacation facilities on Sunday.
Indonesia Tsunami Toll is higher than 800.
Too bad.
By the time the workers from Dongla settled in a safe place in Palu, where workers live in shelters built in their office, they pass drugs along the way, says Mr. Doseba.
"Tell me that they have seen many houses destroyed," he said.
It’s very bad.
Even as relief teams began to fire their bells, some complained that well - informed foreign workers had been forbidden to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, goods and workers from abroad may begin to be included if a disaster report is called a place of national disaster.
That does not happen.
"It’s only a state disaster" says Aulia Ariani, Commenting on the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government said, "Good, this is a national disaster," we should allow help from other countries but it has not yet happened."
As two nights passed in Palu after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, friends and family members hoped that loved ones would be the miraculous instrument of divine intervention in natural disasters.

Mr. Gendon explained that, hours after the reports of the Roa Roa Hotel in the middle of the paroliding community, she had sent the Whastaps App in the Palu's race, which became part of the Beach's feast.
His messages, however, have caused one gray mark, instead of looking at blue lines.

The U.S. must increase the support of A.I.
Since China is more active in I.A., the U.S. should double the number using research in the field, says economist and AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Negotiations from the various parts of the U.S. state have made an announcement to AI, just as no U.S. general plan is planned for AI.
Meanwhile, China started its program last year: it aims to nba .1 in AI in 2030.
"AI research project will be a good start, for all other countries are too far behind the U.S., and we want the next success in AI," says Lee.
Conflicting with financial support may double the chances of a large AI achievement in the U.S., Lee told CNBC on a discussion in this week.
Lee, her book "AI Superpowes: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order "was printed this month by Howton Mifflin Harcourt, Head of the Sivanation Ventures, who has grown in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face +.
In the 1980s at the Carnegie Mellon University, she worked on a new AI team of American Othello performers, later the manager of the Microsoft Research and the President of China’s Google branch
Lee agreed to a former U.S. Department of Public Paper Service for the Rototics Challenge and asked when the next would be, in order to help identify the following industries.
U.S. researchers should often work hard to overcome government resources, says Lee.
"No China removes the educational leaders; they are companies," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technical companies have used lights from universities to work on AI years later.
Lee said that changes in the motive of migration may also help the U.S. to strengthen their AI efforts.
"I think blue cards should be operated automatically on PhD to AI," he says.
China’s Council of China has published the development of the following Development Intelligence Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
China National Natural Science Foundation has poured money on people at educational institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other sources of income from researchers, but the technical profession is small in China, says Lee.
In the early part of the year, the Defense Department of the Joint Intelligence Center, which is to include the members of the faculty and the students, and White House announces the construction of a special sheet of Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced $2 billion in a program called AI Text.
NSF, is planted at $100 billion a year in an AI study.
Meanwhile, the American National Security Committee’s legislation on Artificial Intelligence is no exception.

Greece, which calls Macedonia and its province, goes on to say that their neighbors in the north of their route look for their land and want to enter the TO and EU.
Both governments signed with an established name, but some say that a change of the name means to respect the culture of most Macedonians and Slavs

The question on the charter reads: "You agree with the authenticity of NATO and EU with a Greek contract."

In any case, sufficient votes in parliament decided to accept it.
A change will require two thirds of the course of a parliament.

"We'll be NATO and EU, but we want to join and stop, not by the media door" says Kavarkov.

If they don't want to accept it as a Macedonian, we can convert others like China and Russia and become part of the EU-Assertion."
Prime Minister Zaev says that the NATO membership will bring the needed investment in Macedonia, with an average of more than 20 per cent working people.
"I believe that 80 per cent of our citizens will cry with the EU and NATO," says Zaev after inserting the stick.
He said "yes" the effects "the certainty of our future."

See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through a wall of all Brighton bridges to touch.

The Argentine lay in the stomach at the beginning of the preparation.
He raised himself among three Brighton guardes, before crossing the court.

Scherzer wants to play on the server face. With Rockies
The National Group has been caught in a pony off race, no longer having reason to force another start.
But the challengeary Scherzer wishes that he can come into court on Sunday to face Colorado Rockies, this may be possible if the Rockies are faced with problems in the palloffs, still winning one game by hitting Los Angeles Didgers in the West and NL.
The Rockies still hold one wild-card's bell by winning 5-2 when they have long met with the Nationals on Fridays, but they still look to hold their first breakfast.
"If there’s nothing to play, it's unlikely that once it's gone in the Denver environment of its followers and this one group will be playing the best soap I've ever encountered this year.
Why don’t I want to play there?'
The Nationals are not the publishers to play Sunday, but they seem to let Schezer enter the contest.
Scherzer, who may have attended 34th, had a Bullpen hole on Thursday and will be dropping on Sunday his rest day.

Trump, West Virginia
The president held his speech in the state surrounding his choice of Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court when he stressed the importance of the leaving of the Republics to the choice of the internal and leadership.
"All that we have done on the chart in November."
Five weeks before our decision to make a choice that is most important to our health.
This is one of the great ones, much less -- I am not running, but you can say that I am running, so I am everywhere fighting the skillful chairman," he says.
Trump continued, "You see this brutal, cruel group of nonviolent Democratic people, the one you see now.
And they are determined to return to power in any way they can find, watch merely for cruelty, and pollution.
They don't care whom they hurt, and whom they have to cast to the power, that they may get the power, which they want to control, and that power will not give to them."
Democrats, he said, are in a "rebellious and disturbing campaign."
"And if you look at the last four days," he said, he says, he calls the Democrats "may be angry, cruel, filthy and false."
He then refers to the Seenate Legal Committee which calls the Sen. Democrat Dianne Feinstein by name, which draws water to the masses.
"Do you remember her answer?
Update document?
Yes, yes, I do.
No, I think, one - standing has never told me good news — I have never seen a person’s position so rich. ’
The work crew is no longer a congregation of everyone.
They no longer speak from personal opinions.
When the Momentum officers in my group knocked on my mouth, I was hardly surprised.
But, in fact, I have entered later into the sub-programme of the work crew who are told they are unacceptable — simply because of the talk that is in our minds.
My brother Joan Ryan has received a similar treatment because of opposition to the Semitics.
In my case, those who wanted me to be closed accused accused me of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In view of the importance of the financial system considered, national security, Europe, and other surprises that Jeremy and other leaders have had in previous times.
In an announcement of the Notingham East Labor Group for the Friday convention, we say "We want the meetings to be fair and helpful."
For nearly a year I was the MMP of our crew, the GC meetings of Fridays have been like that.
Sad to say, this is not like social conventions, and the promise of politics is "commercial, gentle" has long forgotten if, indeed, it has ever existed.
It is becoming increasingly evident that opinions on the crew are no longer allowed and that opinions are judged as to whether they are accepted by group leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and my sister, who had the same political views, had also considered me to take sides that I would not agree with — whether it was for the national security or a separate EU market.
Anything I speak in public is no longer important and I say that I will bring a wave of harassment on social networks saying that I am off - line, that it destroys pure politics, that I should not belong to a work force.
And I am not the only one who has faced this situation.
Of course, I know I was better off than my own because the talk about me is still political.
I am still concerned that those of my friends still hold them in duty and their determination not to be self - conscious even in the face of sexual or racial prejudice.
One of the most discouraging features of this political era is how the rates of bullying have emerged.
Jeremy Corbyn said that by the past week the Labour parry must establish a restricted tradition.
The fact is that we no longer see this large and self - assured church or that changing body membership is on the decline.
I have had so many advice over the past two years that I have been urged to slow down, not to speak too much and it will be "right."
But I did not get involved in politics.
Since I had seen Labour in the past 32 years as a student, I was furious with the government of Tatcher for leaving the mud of a damaged community, wanting to bring the best public services to those who need them most — perhaps as a local government or as a government minister.
I have never become involved in politics, including the last one.
No one in the Notingham East in any way can be confused about the law of my position and the positions of the current leadership.
For those who upset the voyage on Friday, all I can say that when the country goes forward to the Brexit that will bring the householder, business, and our public service, I do not wish to spend my time and energy honestly with the Waour party leader.
But one message I have, which I have, of course, in Notingham Momentum, to the outcasts, whether members of the Labour or not: I am content to serve you, and I promise that there will be no threat or political will prevent me from doing what I believe would be best for all of you.

Ayr has 38- 17 Melrose: Ayr has never been separated and sat up
The two tries of the latter have verified the final results, but Ayr is no doubt well recommended for this modern most beautiful Tenens's Premiership game.
Now they are on the move, that is, surrendering to the side of the ten losers.
In the end, their defenses, whenever possible, put them at home with the instructor Peter Murchi, and have every reason to be happy.
He said, "All our games have been tested until now, and we have never been won, so I must be happy."
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Be honored to Ayr, use every opportunity more than we are."
Grant Anderson's 14 - minute search is installed by Frazier Clime, which puts the Ayr, but, the socip Rory Hughes, obtained a yellow card, was released from Warriors, which caused Melrose to build himself up and Jason Baggot held all the winnings.
The Clime Ayr went forward with a penad, just before, in the first half, and put the endo try to make 17-5 to Ayr by vacation.
But Melrose in the second circle started well, and Patrick Anderson's try, fitted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there is time arrest due to serious injuries due to Ruaridh Knott, being thrown out of the frame, when they are moved out, and Ayr with power continued with Stafford McDowall's memory, installed by the Clime.
The Ayr captain is then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose is heavily in debt for Bruce Colvine's function, finally by force.
The family had returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson found a yellow piece after crossing a non-ballged Climo, except on the line of the pencil, Mac Person touched down to the edge of the Ayr.
Climo install, as he did at first, after Kyle Rowe met with a ball pulled by David Armstrong that sends David Armstrong on the household side in the fifth story.
The Game star is in a state of health in restaurants.
The Game Star Ford Kieran seems to plan to move to cooking after discovering that she has been announced as a well known director of the food store.
Jack Jarvis, 56 years old on the popular BBC program, who wrote and became a prominent character and Greg Hempill.
The duo announces that the in-coming chain chain will be the last virtually in the order, and the Kiernan appears to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to the list of officers, he is the director of the Adriftmorn Limed.
The model refuses to comment on the subject, yet the source of the Scottish Sun indicates that Kiernan is looking to be part of Glasgow's "thrivining back into traffic."
‘ The sea is our own: Bolivian authorities hope that the court will open the way to the Pacific
The crew of the jiging-clad house and the La Paz.
Conservative building raises the flag of the icean-blue.
Navals from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have this theme: "The sea is a sea of privilege.
Recovery is our responsibility.
In all parts of Bolivia, the memory of the Coastline was lost to Chile in the 19th century, the spring is still clear — as it hopes to go to the Pacific Ocean again.
Those expectations, perhaps based on your own age, Bolivia, are waiting to be ruled by a global court of justice on October 1, five years later.
"Vali has power, a spirit of unity and submission, and it actually looks forward to the outcome," says Roberto Calzadilla, a legal spokesman for Bolivia.
Many in Bolivia will watch the CCJ rulling on large screens everywhere, with great confidence that the Hague court will win the Bolivian cry of – after the years - Chile is concluded by giving Bolivia to control the side of the sea.
Invo Morales, a qualified president of Bolivia – who is faced with long-term confrontations in the coming year and has much to do with Mondays.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, which vowed towards the end of August.
But some critics believe that the court is less likely to harvest Bolivia - and that the name will change if it agrees.
The Netherlands-support of the UN theme has the power to prize Chile’s domains, insisting that the outcome of the talks will be determined by the success of the talks.
That the ICJ rullings came only six months after the debate was heard that the issue was "not difficult," says the international law observer of Chile, Paz Zárate.
It also serves the purposes of Bolivia, the past four years may have moved them back.
"The issue of sea use has been canceled by the authorities of Bolivia," says Zarate.
Morales ’ protesting violence impedes Chile’s cooperation, he put it.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussions, but it will be more difficult to continue and reason after this.
Two countries had changed by delegates since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, representing Bolivia’s Hague, dismissed the charge that the court was too quick to make a decision.
Monday will bring to Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new time of association with Chile" and the opportunity to establish 139 years of disagreement with the interests of both countries, so put it.
Calzidilla also denies that Morales – one of the most popular Latin - American presidents ever used sea history as a basis for politics.
" Bolivia will never abandon its component of use of the Pacific Ocean."
"The decision is an opportunity to prove that we need to overcome what has passed."
The North Korea says that it will not happen unless it will be possible to trust the American.
North Korea minister R Yong Ho says that his country will not give up nuclear weapons first unless they trust Washington.
R was talking about Saturday at a joint conference.
She has appealed to America to follow her promises at a Singapore conference that was held between the winning leaders.
His observation until the time of America. Secretary of State Mike Pompeii looks at the first issue of nuclear mystery in three months after Singapore and Kim Jon Un of North Korea.
RI says it is an impossible dream that the continuing and refusal of the U.S. will end the conflict in Korea will cause North Korea to fall down.
The Washington has made it clear that it is not acceptable to make Pyonganga announcements before beginning to destroy its weapons.
Both Kim and the U.S. / America President Donald Trump needs a second conference.
However, there is widespread uncertainty that Pyongangy is determined to give up weapons that the world may consider to be the only way to escape.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongya next month for the second conference of Kim and Trump.

If you want to increase the list of your hats or just stop the sun off completely, you may no longer look far.
The editors Valentino and Thomas Browne produced a list of large head hats in their SS 19, in a display in Paris Facsion Week.

Some of the larger objects include pearls with precious stones, the hat of witches.
Thom Browne revealed unusual face masks during Halloween.

Clever - style spectators speculate that large hats may be on their way to the main shopping malls.
The main hat is soon followed by the 'La Bonba', a twin-footed hat to open in this solar, visible on the Rihanna' to Emily Ratajkowski.

John Edward: An agricultural skill is important for the inhabitants of the continent.
The independent schools in Scotland keep details of good results, and this has continued in the year 2018 with other good studies, which are confirmed only by the success of alone and fellow sports, art, music, and other public efforts.
With a severe number of 30 thousand students in Scotland, these schools, the Scotish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), press to bring the best aid.
Special schools aim to prepare students for higher education, for the field they choose, and for their community as citizens of the country.
As an educational department that can organize and start a special educational program, we see modern - day fields becoming more and more popular as a preferred field for schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to the man about the speech that he hears, what you say is right on his head."
If you speak to him in his tongue, what you say comes up into his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we would not always rely on English if we wanted to develop friendship and trust in foreigners.
From the results of this year’s tests, we can see that the tongue is the best in the high school for the best.
There were sixty-eight all of the students who learned the foreign languages and received the Best Type A.
Signs, gathered from the seventy-four schools of SCIS, show that seventy-two percent of the students received High School A in Mandarin, since another seventy-two percent read German, sixty-nine percent of the French students and another sixty-three percent of the Spanish students also read Spanish.
This indicates that the independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills for children, young people who will no doubt need them in the future.
The field is now the subject of your choice, viewed as the same as a primary subject (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in schools that represent education programs and elsewhere.
A UK Commission for Emplomyy and Skills in 2014 found that the reason employers were unable to close ten degrees (17 per cent) for language ability has been reduced.
So especially, language skills are becoming more important in preparing young ones for work opportunities.
For many prospective jobs that I have mastered in languages, these skills are vital to a united world.
No matter what field a person takes, if they read the second song, they put themselves in a better position in the future to develop a similar skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign lands places places a person able to speak more languages in front of his rivals.
According to the You Gov survey of more than 4000 UK (4,000) adults in 2013, 7 and 5 percent were unable to speak foreign agriculture and to have good communication and French is the only number that is grown by 2 percent, fifteen percent (15).
There can be a planting of a tongue that is vital for modern - day children.
Having a lot of available fields of knowledge, especially those in developing lands, will help to train children in the best possible way to get a better job.
In Scotland, schools and schools vary in the language that teaches us.
Most schools focus mainly on teaching old and modern fields, while others teach agriculture that is considered the most important in the UK when compared with the year 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child likes you, there are many types of lemons you can choose from in private schools, and you can feed skilled professionals in the area.
The independent schools of Scotland have dedicated themselves to providing an educational environment that will equip children and equip children with the skills they need to succeed, this time the future holds.
It can be said in the present, international business community that crops will continue to play an important role in the world’s future, so this cannot be produced in education.
In fact, current fields must be included in "in the global communication skills."
The independent schools will continue to surrender this opportunity, diversity, and intelligence to young Scots.
You need to do it well.
John Edward is director of the Scotish Council of Independent Schools.

The Ryder 2018 Gang is confident to fight and keep the hopes in one day's games.
After the three - side meeting on one side, Saturday afternoon, the Ryder Cup games may have been four times.
The weapon of total enthusiasm is the original sporting system but, of course, the players believe in it, which can be compared.
Where, then, would they now say that they are strong?
"They take six points and are now only, so we continue as if by little I think." says Jordan Spieth as they drive a little in the day.
Europe has opportunity, indeed, four points ahead of twenty.
Americans, as reported in Spieth, have little joy and much to be encouraged, not by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and three four points each.
Spieth has always been dangerous and has led them by example.
Those who watched him were especially happy when he became one, a soft golf course is vital for the game to be the same when Thomas himself broke.
His golf which he put in and won the game in 15 the same thrill, this kind calls him believing that the American team has not yet emerged.
"You will really have to dig deep and worry about your own game," says Spieth.
It is now one of the remaining players.
18 mines for identification.
The only to be more gifted than Spieth and Thomas during the past two days is these Frenchsco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which is asked of the Reyder Cup.
Europe's odd but a very compassionate and willing union.
"Moliwood" is the only clients who will not start bogey on Saturday afternoon, but avoidbogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
This fast run, in the sense that both of them are from this noisy crowd who conclude that they will win on Sunday, and no famous athletes will be eager to win Europe as the sun sets for the Golf National rather than for Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both holes differ
The talk about prestige has not changed, however.
Bubba Watson himself Webb Simpson did a small job for Sergio Garcia, the morning surbals, when Alex Noren was arrested.
The main Dougeys left the long line Spaniard and the Swede that they cannot afford.
On Sunday, no one will help you to get out of your grave.
Fourballs, in turn, enjoy close viewing as a result of the cooperation between the nails, their advice, unpredictably counsel, and the means that a subtle scheme can change quickly.
Europe is well organized and led to the end, but the quartersomes have shown that the Society USA still had the power to continue, with a choice of the United States, to doubt.
Europe took 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will be in a beautiful ring on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the quarterbals once a Saturday in 10-6 the U.S.
Fuo Tommy Fleetwood, Francesco Molinari, twice over the intense pulling of the Tiger Woods in four points of the Gulf National.
On the European side Thomas Bjorn, determined to print a cup lost in Hazeltine two years ago, a failure to America in the surbals of the stock, set the 3-1 series.
The U.S. has made it difficult for the firesomes, to win the two games, but it will not only add to the battery.
Jim Furyk's side requires nine points in the 12 Sunday games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first in Europe to achieve one another in the order when she, the same Molinari, called her "Melliwood" after a good weekend, not to win the four points of their four opening games in the Ryder Cup's history.
By subjugating Woods and Patrick Reed in foubalss afterward they laid their bed of Woods exactly the American Bryson Dechembeau 5.54.
Woods, who has entered the two Saturday games, showed great determination, but now she has lost 19 of the 29-foot games in one row after another.
Justin Rose, sitting on the morning foballs, returned to the names Henrik Stepson on the Frances in 2&1 to separate Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third classes in the world.
And they are determined to return to power in any way they can find, watch merely for cruelty, and pollution.
The Jordan Spieth and Justini are three times better able to conquer the Americans by three points on Saturday.
They gained 2&1 by breaking Jon Rahm and the Spanish Ian Poulters in the portals and later won the Poulter and also the Roy McIlroy in 4&3 on the quartersomes during the drawing of two opening holes.
In the Ryder Cup story only two times to have a team from four points to unique games, Furyk on the other side needs to measure only in order to protect his lips.
After doing better for two days, or so, Sunday’s attacks seem to triumph over them.
The North Korea says he will not be unarmed without hope.
The minister of foreign affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that it continues to intensify the loyalty of the United States and that it is impossible for the world to free nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
R Yong Ho told the world General Assembly that North Korea had made "recop" last year, such as nuclear prevention and nuclear testing, nuclear disarmament, and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
You said, "No such, we see no response from the U.S."
"In doubt of the U.S. there will be no hope to protect the world, and under this condition there is no way for us to build ourselves up first."
At a time when the North Korea disagrees with the definition of Washington's "supreme" nuclear refusal while North Korea may be rewarded by taking steps, the statement is by witnesses that it does not prevent nuclear eradication as Pyongga did in the past.
Ri refers to a statement signed by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump for the first meeting between the president of the U.S and North Korea’s leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim asked to work in the denucement of the Korean pencil at the time Trump promised protection of North Korea.
The North Korea has always wanted to finish the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States advised Pyonganga to let the nuclear weapons go first.
Washington had always refused to release North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "end of the originals" and increases the levels of the legislation to achieve its purpose with force, and also refuses "the declaration to end the war" says R.
"To understand that the law can make us a dream of people who don’t care about us.
The problem, however, is that continuing to move ahead deepens our sense of self - worth.
RI did not specify the programs to reunite between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader has appeared in the United Nations from the week.
She conducted at least three meetings between Kim and the South Korean President Maon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If half in the case of nuclear eradication is in South Korea and not U.S., the end of the Korean penicillin will not cause this commitment."
In any case, the sound of R was quite different from that of the previous year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly this is on the U.S. front area of the North Korea's rockets that took place after "Mn. As evil President" Trump named Kim "rocket" in this case.
In this year the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to ‘ finish off entirely, ’ North Korea, Kim’s courage to take armed action, but there is still much to be done and the law remains until the nuclear end of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for the whole thing, "if it takes two, three, or five years, it isn't wrong."
China itself competed with the U.N. Security Council to win the Pyonggggang on the proposed measures.
Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "Secity Council in Thursday must continue in force and never fail until we see the end, fully, and evidence of nuclear annihilation."
The Security Council has agreed to support North Korea in breaking the law since 2006 in establishing the election of the nuclear and the Pyyongy.
The Pompeii met Ri and the U.N. General Assembly and said that after all we were still visiting Pyonganga the next month to prepare for the second time.
Pompeii has been visiting North Korea three times this year, but his final trip has not been an ideal one.
He left Pyongangang in July, which was only made up, of North Korea by publicly speaking to her "just as a criminal."
North Korea arranges a meeting with Mon this month to complete the zone of radiation and nuclear mixture if the United States takes "like steps."
Kim said that she wanted to strengthen her safety when Trump promised in Singapore and created a normal social relationship with Washington.
Harvard mercy has helped students to get sufficient sleep
The new Course at Harvard University this year has not gone into deep sleep so that you can overcome the habit of bingeing using caffeine ‘ all night long.'
Education fields have found many students in high universities to be worthless when it comes to the basics that they can take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has established course, the first of this type U.S.
You were encouraged to start the range after you gave you a talk about how sleep delays me in reading.
At the end of it the girl came to me and said, 'Why am I told this now, in my middle age?'
She said that no one had ever told her about my sleep – which surprised me,' and told the Telegram.
Course is released for the first time this year, explaining to students the value of sleep habits that help relax and exercise, while improving everyday well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's history, said that the university decided to die of Course after learning that many students do not sleep at all during the week.
The length of the study involves a series of stages.
The first section is the picture of the school room, where students select the coffee, cofee courses, tutors, and books on the effects of caffeine and the light of sleep, as well as sleep.
On the other hand, the participants are told that prolonged sleep increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The company’s map, with practical features, will then encourage the participants to reflect on their day - to - day routine.
‘ We know that it will not change the behavior of the readers as soon as possible.
We believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about your health by choosing to smoke cigarettes,' adding Professor Czeisler.
The practice of cliques in the area to the end is a phenomenon, which means, in addition, that modern technology and excessive pressure on the students reduces sleep rates that are growing.
To ensure that she sleep well enough, it should be a student's ‘ secret weapon ’ to overcome stress, fatigue and anxiety, which means avoid becoming overweight, since sleep is concentrating on the condition of hunger, causing them to be hungry.
Raymond Shuhi, a 19 - year - old student in California who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare a study, once studied in one of his classes last year while studying his first year in Harvard.
She said that the study had opened her eyes and urged her to dream the study and become a center for all of us.
The next step, of hope, is to invite high - ranking students to learn in the same manner as this literacy program before they join a clearly competitive center.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students should consider searching the albums while going to sleep, as well as that they will wake up, and understand the bad effects of ‘ blue light' produced by the lights, and LED light, which can take you out of the spiral, which leads to angles.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menge Study lowers Gerard’s men
The Ringers was organized and moved away when questioned by Dolly Menga, who attacked Steven Gerard's adverse case and failed in Livingston.
The Ibrox has even intended to record their first victory since in February 41 in St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holt’s team who is a link to the second victory of Gerard in 18 games as the governor who left his case behind in eight points of the Ladbrokes Premiership Earts.
Turn up against seven minutes before the helf-time, and the Ringers' players persevere unhurried.
By the time the Ragers descend to the sixth site, Livingston stands on the third stop and behind the Hibernian they differ in degree.
It would also be good to come up with the Ringers after the line Calum Spencer was conceived with the first aid after an accident caused by something turned away.
Gerard made eight changes on the previous side of Ayr to the Betfred Cup for Finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with that same Livets that 11 made a point last week and would rejoice in the way your well - dressed clothes put off his rivals on every side.
The Ragers may have held the ball extensively, but Livingston has done a lot of good with the ball he has obtained.
They would have been in bed for two minutes when Menga’s bed sent Scott Pittman to an article by Allan McGregor but a bowman missing a large opportunity to play the stage.
Keggick of Keghan Jacobs has found Craig Halkettoy-skipper but her boyfriend Alan Lithgow has thrown it back.
The Ringers was able to control but was more trusting than believing in their game in the third class of the game.
Alfred Morelos felt that he had to get a pencil in our home while in a relationship with Steve Lawles but the poet Steven Thomson has canceled the call for a Colombian.
The Ragers has been able to insert two points in the first half directly in front of the pole but with the old Ibrox Iam Kelly without concern with a piece loaded on Lasana Colibally's head and the low invasion by Ovie Ejaria.
By the time Livi opened up at 34 afternoon, there may have been no sporting events, no one would deny that they were fit for their work.
The Ragers again failed to resist Jacobs’s soccer team.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher knocked Scott Robinson, who had permitted him to finish easily.
Grardubbu and the movement after a break while converting Colibaly by Ryan Kent and this change is almost immediate during the moment when the rower leans over Morelos but Kelly’s excited turn from his line to block.
But Livingston goes on to describe the spectators by playing their favorite games, and Lithgow and Halket played long balls after other distant ones.
Holt’s side could open the gap to leadership in the final stages, but the standing McGregor banned Jacobs before the Lithgow hit a ball on the corner.
Ragers, Glenn Middleton, has a long history of tract dating Jacobs, but Thompson is also on the opposite side.
Almanac: Geiger Counter Searcher
And now our page " Church Sunday morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and UBABA ... the day the next physics of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that led to the final step of the Geiger Counter.
The science compass since then, the Geiger Center turned into a pop corner, such as in 1950 movies “Bells of Coronado, ” where scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘ Is that? ’
Rogers: "Geiger Counter, used to find radioactivity minerals, such as uranium.
While installing open earphones, you can sense radioactivity produced by minerals.
Evans: "It says they get out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just 63 years before she was born.

A new goal of cancer may teach the immune system to ‘ see ’ wrong cells
A new goal of cancer can teach the immune system to ‘ see ’ wrong cells and kill them
The goal is to teach the immune system to ‘ see' wrong cells as a treatment program.
The procedure involves taking the immune cells from the patient, which are changed to the library.
'Don' standard protein for most cancers and then re-added
The objective of color points to promising results for patients with a form of cancer.
A woman who had a goal - to - do therapy, who taught the immune system to see wrong cells, saw the cervical cancer disappear in 18 months.
This procedure involves taking protective cells from the patient, converting the virus to "see" the normal protein of HER2 cancer, and replanting the cells.
Professor Jay Bezofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results seem to have a promising goal."
HER2 "pronounces the growth of cancer types," including breast, ovarian, lung and other cancers, explains Prof Berzofsky.
The same method of taking protective cells from patients and teaching them is "how you understand from cancer cells that have been properly used in treating certain types of chimia.
West was in the mind of setting Trump, wearing the MAGA hat, after his appearance in the cell suit.
It wasn’t a good idea
The West was once hailed as a radio in Saturday Light Live after a song praising American President Donald Trump and saying he would come in 2020.

They say, 'Don't miss the hat.'
They abused me!
And they say I am still in the wilderness," she says, according to the Washington Watch Tower.
Well, West continued: "Do you want to see a place in the wild?" she said, "You can wear her supman cap, because it means you can't tell her what to do. You want the world to continue?

But the director of the chat program Karen Hunter wrote to the twitzer and said that West "she is sitting and is good."
"But I have chosen not to give thanks to anyone (by buying his music or style or painting his ‘ art ’) which I believe is becoming and full of dangerous minds in the community.
You are free.
So we're," he added.
Before the exhibition, the rubper moved from the Twitter to change his name, which is now to be called "By the old name Kannye West."

The top athlete Kit Harington condemns bad male culture
Kit Harington is well aware of the role of the sword-fighting, called Jon Snow, on the edge of the long-sphered HBO Game of Thorns.
But the model, 31, criticizes the tradition of a top warrior, saying that such sites on the screen say that young boys must be strong enough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed there would be a good thing and asked how to cope with bad male culture in the sessions of # Nama and Me.

'I feel myself, very sensitive, not yet – life is lost in this man?'
'What would we teach men when they were growing up, according to the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that the telescope can play a small role in stimulating the bad male culture because of its role models
You continue: ‘ What is the natural environment that has been taught?
What is taught on TV, on the streets, convinced young boys of the guilt?
Do I think that is the big problem at this time of change?

HIV/Aids: China reports 14% of progress in new circumstances.
China declares a 14% rise in the number of residents living with smallpox and the number of mines.
Over 820,000 people were affected in the country, health officials said.
Some 40,000 new cases are reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases came.
Most of the new sexual scandals that have been transmitted over the centuries are changed.
But the number of people receiving insurance in this way has reduced to about zeros, Chinese health officials said so at the Yunnan district convention.
The year-year, however, the number of people who live with the virus and the nuclear club has increased to 100,000.
Nuclear compromises are now a minor problem in the LBT company.
The crime of homosexuality in China was removed in 1997, but discrimination against homosexuals is rampant.
As a result of life - styles, studies have found that 70-90 percent of men and women eventually married women.

Since 2003, the government of China has promised to make the world a comeback as an attempt to cope with the problem.
Maxxine Waters deny that another activity has destroyed the knowledge of the GOP samotors, explosions of a 'dangerous false' or 'boots'.
In the U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters has made charges that one of her employees has included a number of three satellites in the Republican, U.S.A. on a list of lawyers in Wikipedia.
The Democrats of Los Angeles have announced that the charges have been spread by experts "be-ultra-right" and on the Internet.
"A lie, a lie, and many other lies are shocking," says Waters in a Twitter statement.
The explosion includes the home addresses and numbers of the U.S.S.S.S. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hasch, both of them in Utah.
Information came from the Internet on Thursday, introduced to a stranger at Capitol Hill while listening to the Seenate Panel on sexual misconduct at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
This break occurs after Kavanaugh has been presented with three satellite questions.
Older sites such as the Gateway Pundit and the Red State report that the IP refer to the Waters office are connected with it and that it is the main source of the information for Waters' work, reports Hill.
"These unprovable critics are false and are not true," Waters continued.
"The beauty of my staff – ownership, personal identity, and safety of the vulnerable as a result of false and false accusations – did not include the breaking up of the target.
These false accusations are very false and are not true."
Waters' statement quickly became criticism on the Internet, including the former White Housepress secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This resistance can be tiring," writes Fleischer.
"This means he doesn't have the meekness to fight the General Public.
If a person is accused of something that he has not done, he should not be discouraged.
They should not.
They should not criticize the accuser’s motives.
They must be calm and at peace.
Fleischer said that he likens Waters' response to criticism by Democrat Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by the most stressed critics at the time of the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican successor to enter Waters' shoes in the time-time selection, breathe with him in his mind at Twitter.
"It's too great if true," writes to Twitter.
In his parliament, Waters said that his office had informed "right officers and the body of the law against these frauds.
"We will ensure that the guilty are exposed," he continues, "and they will be charged with all their acts of vandalism and accidents in any place or of all my employees."
The view of Johnny English Strikes Again — lowering the balance of the Roman Atkinson’s spony
It is the custom now to see the value of Brexit in any British film film and not to look forward to the rise of the Johnny English game – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and its 2011 return to Johnny English Reborn.
eating hot potatoes as we said in the article that we could have a new chance to sell outside?
At any rate, an open eye, Johnny English’s right to promote new things a second time — that name is a big joke designed for movie theaters for non - English - speaking people.
You are indeed the most impeccably the most impropriety of even his unusual self to glory, the Clousau, Mr Bean's father, and his influence from the Chariots of Fire for the open London 2012 Olympics.
And it is from a traveler and mysterious man named Atkinson who passes through the present corrupt commercials on Barclaycard TV, who has left much confusion in his resurrection.
There are other times and two times in this present visit to JE.
I like Johnny English to ride on a helicopter with an old military suit and a small sword hanging over his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of humor is a display, but laughter seems to be very low and extreme, especially in the production of the film's "study" as 047 and the Mission Insssible itself now offering laughters as an addiction.
Laughters are more common than adults, and Johnny’s visit to me is shallow and shallow and focused on Atkinson’s sound - filled film added to Bean’s sounds and personality.
The case on the left is now that Great Britain is in a big plaza.
The Cyber-Hacker entered the secret network of British spies, producing a number of British junts in the field, which is concerned with the eccentric egregular work - which is a small task for Kevin Eldon.
The last minute in the printer carrying and carrying the bight, facing the failure of the political center: Emma Thompson is trying to imitate Teresa-May but there is little in the text to tell about it.
His inspectors informed him that the whole inspector had been altered, should follow the person who is still in the ring.
This means that Johnny English himself, now as a cholmaster in an expensive environment, but he offers a hard lesson on the character of the explorer: the humors, as English presents the tourist theory at Rock-type adademy.
The English was forced in Whitehall to be given urgent orders and met by Bough's boyfriend, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is still a married man, joined by the submarine commander, a beautiful place played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin of making things very close to the Queen's Secret Service returned, meeting Olga Kurylenko's atumhammeta Opelia Bulletin.
There, the prime minister is quick to draw to the theories of millions who can solve computer problems: the commission Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
England and Bough began their strange journey: hiding as a cana, they started a fire in France; they began a traffic problem with the Volta; and English, which took away the mystery while he learned to use the Virtual Reity heidset to celebrate the Volt's house.
All efforts are made to improve the final session or to improve friendship and motivation, with children TV about everything.
They have indeed.
And like Johnny English’s other films I was unable to control: Britain’s movie industry had not been able to give Rowan Atkinson a proper place to show his talent?
Labour denies that they have devised a plan to work Brintons for four days but to pay five days ’ wages
The Jeremy Corbyn group of the Labours think of a marvelous plan to see Britons working with four characters – but paid five.
The team has reported that it is necessary for company management to pass on a profit made by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the staff by giving them an additional day.
The workers seem to enjoy the three really days of the week – but earn the same amount.
sources say that this view would fit the class’s economic objective as well as the policy to convert the nation to the workers.
A change in four days is authorized by the Trades Union Congress as a way to take an economic break.
An elderly Book of Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A police inspection is expected to be done before the end of the year.
'It will not happen at night, but four days in the church, but work four days is a matter of the process of remuneration and the entire sense of the system'.'
The Labour Party will not begin to recommend the plan, and the Green Party which adheres to its four workdays during its 2017 annual adoption capign.
The entire Labour Party plan has not yet been set up, however.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: 'The work of four days is not a organizational policeman and is never thought of by the group.'
Shaw Chancellor John McDonnell used the conference of the past Labour week to express his view of capitalism in the economy.
Mn Mn McDonnell said that he was determined to be strong and the power is also ‘ leading the unknown' with the ‘jumps ’ in the industrial firms.
The program also explains that horses in the water companies may not find the whole story as the government of Labour doing ‘ attracting' in the wrong way.
He also saw to ensure that the personnel to the company's Boards and Incsulative Usership Funds give 10 per cent of the printer-servity's qualities to the staff, who will equip the annual profits limited to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy suggests "60 Minutes" that the FBI's study of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
Research on the FBI’s criticisms by Judge Brett Kavanaugh reduced the time of election for the Supreme Court last week, and raised questions that the detectives ’ findings could change the way the satellites in the Republic had influenced the followers.
In a meeting recorded on Sunday, "60 Minutes" with Scott Pelley is asking the Republican Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or FBI if they can find something to change their minds.
Kennedy seems more comfortable than his South Carolina counterparts.
"I'm sure," says Kennedy.
"When I went to the side, I, too, spoke to the judge Kavanaugh.
I called her back to do this, and those threats came out, and I said, 'You did it?'
He is stubborn, going forward and not knowing it."
Graham’s lamp, however, appears to have been cut off.
"My opinion is determined by Brett Kavanauh and will take strong criticism," he said.
"D. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has immediately resisted," adds Graham, describing Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all who read did not confirm that.
It has been 36 years of war.
I see nothing changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has tried to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will handle the Global Citizen Festival, a year - old event with a full - costumed and well - intentioned players; to eliminate poverty on earth.
Now in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will have a swarm of people streaming into the huge courtyard of Central Park not only to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but to get the real sense of getting rid of the night by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, defined in 2012 as the Global Poverty Project, an international group that strives to eradicate poverty by increasing its efforts.
To get a ticket to an event (unless you want to pay for the VIP tickets), chiropractics should do something like "actual" such as money, e - mail to the world leader, phone or other deep - seated actions to help you concentrate on ending poverty.
How successful has the Global Citizen been in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of benefiting people at a free concert the only way to try people to do something, or something else called "clickvisitism" – people who feel that they make a difference by signing a list on a computer or sending it to a ticket?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has marked more than 19 million of their members' "acts, ” with a loss of the management of different aims.
It says that these actions have helped rid the earth of its inhabitants of self - support and goals that may exceed $37 billion to affect the health of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In 2018, a group lists 390 ideas and recommendations as to their actions, nearly $10 billion that have been removed or tried to be collected.
A group estimates that the current income directly affects nearly 649 billion people around the world.
Other commitments include The Power of Nutrition, U.S. bankers and founders devoted to “help children in the right way," it is promised to provide Rwanda $135 million to help eliminate famine in the country after obtaining 4,700 items in the Global Citizens.
"With the establishment of the UK, donors, state governments, and the Global Citizens like you, we can try to make a history of human malnutrition due to the absence of public reform," the Power of Nutrition Massor Trade Peace Ullman has signed a mass concert in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that over 5,000 years to call the U.K. has improved the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced the support of the project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 billion women and children by means of nutrition.
In response to some of their FATs asking "What do you think we can do to eliminate serious poverty?"
Global intelligence answered: "It will be a long and difficult way — at times we will fall and fail.
However, like public rights and anti-partheid revolutions before us, we will win, for we are very strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and others have contributed to this annual event in New York, which is celebrated by Deborra-Le Furnes and Hugh Jackman.

Washington "if it is necessary" to use capitals to prevent the Russian ergeny markets, including the Middle East, the SImperial Secretary Ryan All revealed, by the Washington Examiner.
All said that Russia's discussions with Syria - clearly, when working with the official government - is a way to try other new nergy markets.
"I believe in the reason in the Middle East they want to find ergeny as in Eastern Europe, and in mid-Nigigium and Europe," he reports.
Also, according to the worker, there are ways to correct it.
"The United States knows, through our army, to ensure that the seaways are opened, and, if necessary, are closed, to ensure that their power is not in the market," he says.

"Selecting trade with Iran and Russia, to some extent, is the way to gain and obtain oil," he says, when speaking of Russia as "a horse of craftyness" and has an economic confidence in oil spills.
These statistics are evident as the Trump office is working to encourage the export of their natural gas supply to Europe, to replace Russia, the most cheap of European merchants.

The Kremlin maintains that the Washington project’s inconsolably due to economic reasons and is an example of an unfair competition.
"I believe we have the same idea that the power cannot be a force to exert pressure and that buyers should be able to choose from whom they buy," said Russian Prime Minister Aleksandr Novak after an assembly with US Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The status of the US caused Germany to slow down, once again strengthening its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has told the US to quit the process of EU powers and agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when the third country interferes with our sending power," says Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the recent convention between the German Concellor, Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

For the survivors, the situation of curiosity is a reality.
"It’s really critical," says a 35 - year - old mother named Rsa Kunya Kusanga, comforting her son at the center of the town of Palu.

I hope they are alive."
The U.S. ambassador indicts China 'with fear' of false advertising'
After a week the official Chinese newspaper had a four - page business advertisement for both the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing by using an American newspaper to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about the China Daily property in Des Moines Register - a well - purchased Iowa newspaper - after accusing China of wanting to join the Nov. 6 election campaign in the U.S., which is what China refuses.
The Trump charge that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. election created what U.S. officers said to Reuters are a new class in the Washington campaign against China.
While foreign governments usually have to advertise the trade, Beijing and Washington are now caught in the growing commercial struggle that has created to create an endless competition for the exchange of goods.
The funds that China had demanded at the beginning of the commercial war were intended to harass imports such as the Iowa for the Republican Party of Trump, says Chinese and U.S.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is sending most of the agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has ruined American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in the case of the Sunday Des Moines Register, "It’s twice the harassment by making false advertisements in our free newspaper."
"In the field that has been distributed, the Chinese government has made itself available in the popular American culture of free speech with a free newspaper by placing a subscribed notice on Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
“ On the contrary, at the street market here in Beijing, there are few different opinions you will find and you will not see the real reaction of the different viewpoints the Chinese may have on the outcome of China’s economic crisis, if it is thought that the media are looking at the cover of China’s Comunist Party," he writes.
He has added that "one of China’s leading newspapers has fled from the opportunity to print his story", although he did not say which newspaper it was.
The Republiccans Kill Women Before the Middle Ages due to the Kabaugh Failure, a Warning to the Inquisitors
Since many of the high Republiccans are waiting and protecting the possibility of being admitted to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanau to several charges about bullying, the reviewers have warned that the fire will come back with the passenger, especially for the passengers, during the medieval election in the future.
The upper lungs in this regard, and many of the Republiccans are already expressing themselves that they wanted to go further with the election.
Those things will no longer be postponed," Grant Reherr, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School telling The Hill in a Saturday article.
Reher said that the last attempts of the Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) that the FBI has made the investigation will suffice to enable angry voters to lower their lungs.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - will not forget tomorrow and November," says Karine Jean- Pierre, a red consultant and a national spokesman for the development group Moveon on Friday, according to the newspaper Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted, "You’re coming November!" As they rioted in the Sanate hall as the Republicans control the Judith Committee chooses to continue and choose Kavanaugh despite the evidence that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"Democrats and enthusiasm will be gone forever," says Stu Rothenberg, a political activist, telling the news.
"People say it’s already hot; that’s true.
But it can still be much higher, especially among female voters in cities and teenage voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although not interested the president, are less likely to vote."
Even before the evidence of the Ford is clear of his accusations against the possibility of being admitted to the Supreme Court, the reviews say that the fire can return with the mind if the Republiccans continue to confirm.
"This is now a GodP damage," says Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the past week, in NBC News.
"It's not just the party vote of the committee or the last vote or that Kavanough is put on a bench, as to how the Republiccans handle this and how they dealt with him," says Guy Cecil, director of the Princes USA, a group helping people to select Democrats, telling the media.
However, the Americans seem to be divided between whom they believe in the testimony of the Ford and Kavanaugh, and they tend to strike up-Kabaugh.
New figures from You Gov show that 41 percent of the people actually or to some extent believe in the evidence of the Ford, while 35 percent say that they truly or to some extent believe in Kavanough.
Moreover, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh was certainly wrong in the evidence he gave, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI now investigates the charges brought by the Ford and at least one prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford spoke before the Seenate Juicy Committee reported last week that Kavanaugh had abused him at the age of 17.
Ramirez says that the defendant in the Supreme Court had her private parts shown her during the parties during your study period in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web founder plans to start New Internet Conflicting and Facebook
Tim Berners-Le, World Wide Web founder, sets up a program to compete with another Facebook, Amazon and Google.
A new technical project, Inrut, is a company built on an open well of the Berners-Le platforms of Solid.
(%s) allows users to select where their data will be stored and information for people who are allowed to access it.
In a unique conversation with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made a joke saying that the Inrupt purpose is "to control the earth."
"We must do it now," he says so often on the job.
"It's history."
This applet uses the Solid technology to allow people to make their own "personal online data" or POD.
You may have a number of human numbers, what to do, a calendar, a musical library, and other personal instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify are all found in the same brush and at the same time.
What is significant about the POD store depends on the user who can find the type of data.
The company calls you "magnetic data."
Incrupt’s idea, in keeping with the CEO of the company John Bruce, is that the company can bring the rice, proces, and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently has Berners-Le, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, inventors who have specialized projects, as well as many volunteer coders.
Since this week, the inventors of technology around the world may be able to develop their own amputees using available tools in the Inrupt library.
Berners-Le said that he and his group spoke with " Facebook and Google as to whether or not to bring about a complete change in which all their business will change completely.
"We don't ask their permission."
In another package to the Media printed on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "needs to provide trade and operating powers that will help protect the integrity and the new library ring built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Le converted the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners- Lee has taken the lead in the debate in neutrality.
Even when Inrupt is released, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortum, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am looking forward to the beginning of this coming web age," adds Berners-Le.
Bernard Vann: Praised by a priest who has received the Victoria Cross for WW1
The only minister of the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross during World War I has been hailed in his city for 100 years.
Lt Col Professor Bernard Vann was awarded the prize on September 29, 1918 in the invasion of the Jacobgise and Lehaukcourt.
However, he was killed four days later and did not realize that he had won the greatest prize in the British military.
A memorial stone has been opened with two of his grandchildren at the time of the clock in Rushden, Northamptonshire, Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "a good sign" that the stone has been opened in the right year since his grandfather won the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his army across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a gun-hustin.
Later she rushed to the shooting site and boldly led ahead before running with a gun and killed three soldiers.
The Lt Col Vann was killed by a German gun on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his grandfather's actions are "something I don't know I could do but something that makes me respect him."
She and her brother Dr James Vann put flowers behind the clock, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Bad.
Michael Vann said that he said "the nation has the great right to take part in the clocks" and said that "real strength is shown by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA followers stay all night to watch Bellator 206, but they receive Pep Pig
Imagine, sitting all night to watch Bellator 206 and being forbidden to watch a party.
The San Jose party had 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown pointing all night at the UK on Channel 5.
In 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Roy MacDonald were ready for battle, UK observers were left stunned when the station changed to Pep Pig.
Some have been disappointed after a long night of waiting, especially in the morning when the match was over.
One Twitter described this transition to children's animation as "an unexpected joke."
"It is government law that by 6 a.m. this competition was not appropriate, so it has had to be changed to the children's schedule," says Dave Schwartz, president of Bellator's trade and communications president, when asked about this change of system.
"UPAPPUPA is the pig," yes."
The president of the Bellactor company Scott Coker said they would take a closer look at their stock to join UK observers in the future.
"I think if I think I can play it again, I think we can try it," said Coker.
"But it is six o’clock on Sunday there, and we can’t fix it until Sunday, Monday in their time.
But we are on it.
I tell you, at changing times there were many messages sent to each other and all of them were not pleasant.
Trying to fix it, we thought it was a technological problem.
But it was not, it was a matter of government.
I promise that it will never happen again.
We will keep five competitions less than six - as we usually do and try to please our followers and have gone too far.
It was an unlikely situation.
Desert Island Disscs: Tom Dayley feels “freed out ” because of her sexual activity
Olympic poet Tom Darley says that she has grown up isolated because of her sexual experience — but that gives her the motivation to succeed.
The 24 - year - old jumper said he was not aware until he went to high school to say "I don't like everybody."
Commenting on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discses published by Lauren Laverne, you mentioned homosexual rights in order to give others "hope."
He also said that if a parent makes him concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular broadcast of the available program, Kirsten Young, has completed months of inactivity because of ill health.
From being abandoned in Laverne's first program, Darley said she felt "dog off" by everyone while growing up because "it was acceptable for boys and girls."
She said: "To this day, those feelings of worthlessness, feeling different, have given me the strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he too was “a man, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when it was finally discovered that he was homosexual.
The winner who won the Olympic medal twice is a member of the senior board for LBT and used his position in the Olympic Games in Australia this year to urge other countries not to view homosexuality as a homosexual.
She has said that she has spoken because she feels fortunate to be able to live safely without having to face problems and is willing to give others "hope."
This hero who won three times in the world's international competition had a romantic relationship with the US film maker Dustin Lance Black, met with him in 1313 - "I see him suddenly."
Dale married the prize of Oscar, who left him 20 years ago but said that the years separated have never been a problem.
"When you experience a lot of life at such an early age, - go to her first Olympics at age 14 and her father died of cancer three years later — it’s difficult to find someone of his own age who has had similar experiences.
The two were born in June, the son whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Darley said he had "his opinion" changed.
"If you were to ask me last year, it had to be said, 'I need to win a gold ring,' he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold towers.
My gold medal for the Olympics is Robbie.
Her son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says that he did not accept his father’s death and one of the last things he had asked if they had tickets to London in 2012 — as he wanted to be there.
"I couldn't say 'I' won't be able to attend those games'," he said.
"I took her by my hand when she took her last breath and until she breathed her last and died when I saw that she too was a person like us," she said.
The following year Daley entered the 2012 Olympics and won a copper medal.
"I immediately realized that this is what I have been looking for all my life, that I have been looking for in front of my people in the Olympic Games, and that's what I have been looking for, that's what I have been looking for.
It also gave him the choice of his favorite song — the Proud of Heather Small - which has been echoed in the mind during the time of the preparation of the Olympics and is still an enthusiasm for him.
The Desert Island Disscs is BBC Radio 4 Sunday 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is sitting on a bench in Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson of America will record on Sunday when playing his 47 Ryder Cup game, but he will have to go up socks so as not to be a embarrassing historian.
Mickelson, who will be playing on this event once every two to 12 years, is seated on the bench by Captain Jim Faryk on Saturdays and morning hours.
Instead of taking the lead, as he often takes the lead in playing for the United States, this five - year winner split the day into an promotion and worked at his game in hopes of finding out what was causing him to stumble.
Since he is not a good character, even after a long time in the game, the 48 - year - old Wafa Wafa National soccer player, where the giant play place is often a problem when playing a distant ball.
And if the play area is not such a problem, Mickelson, who will be playing the ninth Sunday, will face Francesco Molinari, a British-centric star who has been able to play straight, who has played with Tomy Fleetwood' red to win their games in this week.
If these Americans, who have lost four points in the 12 games of a single player, start the game well, the Mickelson's game can be a complete break.
Furyk expressed confidence in his fellows, and he did not say anything else.
"You fully understand his role today, he put his arm around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow," says Faryk.
"You have great confidence.
He is a well - known performer, and he has accomplished much in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think of him playing two games.
I expected more of me, but that is what happened and that is what we thought we should do.
You want to play, like everyone else."
Mickelson will rewrite past Nick Faldo in the number of games he played for most of the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It may be his last game for the Ryder Cup that you have never done as a player.
Mickelson has triumphed 18 times, has been eaten 20 times and played in equal numbers, although Furyk says his presence has improved the group.
"It’s good to be with her, to make fun, to make fun of people, and to be a good person in a group room," she has explained.
"I think young players have enjoyed her company, and, this week, it’s good to see you.
She does much more than play."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that taking the lead in many points is not significant
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows that leading with many points to the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a heavy game.
The Dane first played in the 1997 games in Valderrama, where a team with the Sever Ballesteros took the lead in five points over the Americans but finally in one point, winning at 141 1⁄22-131.
"You always remember that we were leading with many points in Valderrama; we led with many points at Brookline, where we were eaten, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a few points," says Bjorn, in the picture, after seeing the 2011 Class, winning both Friday and Saturday to take the lead in 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else in the group that it has not yet ended.
Do your best in the morning.
Then do all things well.
It is not until you find the points.
We have a goal, and that is what we are inclined to do.
I have said this long ago, I concentrate on the 12 players in our team, but we know exactly what you mean about this the largest team in the world."
Excited by the way his athletes played in a difficult theater, Byjorn has added: “I will never come to the end of this.
The next day’s game is different.
In the future each player will decide how to play, and that is a different matter.
It’s good to go out and play with a person when things are going well, but if you’re playing alone, that’s where you’re fully tested as a golf player.
That’s the message you need to pass on to the players, that you do all you can in the future.
Now, she leaves her player behind and must go and do everything she can."
Unlike Bjorn, rival Jim Furyk will be seeing that his players are better off alone than they are, except the Jordanan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have found three fourth points.
Furyk himself knows both eating and winning on the last day at the last minute, since he has been part of the victory team in Brookline before being eaten while Europe is "supped in Medidah."
"I remember well," she always replies when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the Captain of 1999, urged his players on the final day.
"We have 12 important games in the morning, but it would be good to start with high gear as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
As that energy and enthusiasm keep burning, you are putting great pressure on those in the center.
We have organized our players in harmony with that and have put our players in a way we think, which will enable us to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the job of trying to take the lead in the fight and return from the game and face the Rory McIlroy in a major sport, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poloter and other Europeans in the upper class.
"I’m going with this group because I think it’s going to be ready for the whole game," says Brurn of the choice.
The German battleship is being reconstructed
The new nature of the German stormer Navy, called Frigate, had to begin working in 2014 to replace the old Old War-era ships, but it will not exist until at least the next year because of the synthesis and the cost of the snowball, reports local news.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' commission," the leader of the new ship Baden-Wuertteberg-clas frigate, has now been adjusted in the early part of the 20th, says Die Zeit, a newspaper quotes the military subject.
The ship had to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that followed the diesel had threatened the future of a determined project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuertteberg-clas, isolated by the Navy as early as the Bremen-clas.
Understandably, ships will have powerful guns, types of explosives that fire on planes, ships, and hidden technology, such as the absence of land, infrared and noise.
Some of the essentials included long periods of care are impossible to use new ships for two years at the port.
However, the continuing breakthrough means that the important development of warships - to give Germany power abroad - will be out of the way when it begins to function, says Die Zeit.
The ship with the F125 dead future appeared on paper last year, when the German Navy refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohmbnase Vos to the port of Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to which it was made after being brought in.
Little is known about the reasons for the return of the ship, but the German newsmen said that there was much important problem regarding "sofofter and war" which would make the battleship useless if it was sent to battle.
Software problems have been particularly important since the Baden-Wuertteberg-clas will be used by a crew of 120 ships - half of the old Bremen glass ships.
It has also been discovered that the ship has a much higher weight than the necessary means to reduce its operation and the possibility that Navy will be able to provide future improvements.
The 7th ton of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" believes it had twice the same weight of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the problem of hartware, the total cost of the project - including training a crew - has also been a problem.
It is said to be reaching a staggering £3.1 million ($3.6bn) - from £2 million.2 million.
The problems of new ships are as important as recent warnings to indicate that German naval power is losing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans- Peter Bartels, the German general of the parliament committee, admitted to Navy that he was well "in charge of the discharge and entry of the ships which could be used."
The officer said that the problems had increased in time, since the older ships were no longer working but no longer operating ships.
You are disappointed that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-clas have been able to join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the hidden life of bats
A new study carried out in the Scotish Highlands has intended to reveal how bats use local habitats when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the discoveries will enable us to understand the life - style of these rare flying creatures and help direct the conservation activities in the future.
A study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common pitelles of singing and Daubeton bats with long brown ears in the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special records will be posted at locations to monitor the activities of bats throughout the year.
NHS and volunteers will make little investigations using handheld monitors.
A reasonable analysis of the knowledge of all records will show the frequency of bats ’ call and what certain animals do.
The accompanying map and the report will be published to create a detailed portrait of the area in which they live.
Rob Dewar, NTS zoo adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which areas are most important to bats and how these animals use them.
This knowledge will help to see the benefits of local control activities such as Meadow recovery and the best way to preserve areas with bats and related animals.
Scots in Scotland and throughout the UK are rare throughout the past century.
They are threatened with building projects and building materials that affect their habitat and the loss of it.
Electric power systems and lights can pose dangers, and so can fly - kill papers and house - care medicines, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not necessarily blind.
However, as they hunt at night, their ears work more than their eyes when hunting a animal.
They use a complex system to detect the source of noise to locate animals and their environment.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, considers bats important.
It has ten trained professionals, who make regular checkups, and checks on where and how to protect them.
The organization even lists the first Scots island and the only bats in the Trreave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of Scots live.
The local director, David Thompson, says that this is a good place to live.
"Here the Trreave is the best place for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many large trees, and other suitable areas.
But there are many things about bats that we don't know, so the work we do here and in other buildings will help us understand more about what they need to survive."
He emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before working on buildings because it may be possible to destroy their one residence area of some 400 square miles [400 sq km], almost to kill all who live there.
Bats are protected, and the law does not permit them to kill, torture, or disturb or destroy their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, Scot Conservation Trust officer, encouraged the community to come to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about our bats, and most of our species do not know what makes them survive."
Ronaldo rejects charges of torture as lawyers plan to pay for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo spoke of the charges that he had made by saying "false news," which says that people "want to improve themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers arrange to pay for the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published these charges.
This Portuguese actress and Juventus is accused of sexually abusing an American woman, whose name is Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room at Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid $375,000 to close his mouth to the incident, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on the Instram Live video with its 142 million adherents after hours of the criticism, Ronalddo, who is 33 years old, has published these reports as "false stories."
"No, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false news," says an actor recommended for Ballon d'Or five times as a camera.
"They try to make a name for themselves by using my own name.
It is normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but it is part of the work.
I am happy and all goes well," adds the player, with a smile.
Ronaldo’s attorneys are prepared to pay for these criticisms, which they call them "an unacceptable report on personal life," says Reuters.
President Christian Schetz said that the player would want to be returned the money "for the damage of his dignity by the number equal to the number of charges, probably the most serious thing is the violation of the current human rights."
This reported incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in the nightclub, Ronalddo and Mayorga are said to return to the performer’s room, where he is said to have attacked him, in accordance with the papers posted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the event and told him that he was "99 per cent" with errors "one percent."
The councillor says that he has agreed to have sexual relations with both parties, but they have agreed.
Mayorga also admitted to the police and took photographs of those who had been wounded there, but later he admitted that the matter was handled outside the court because he felt "that he was afraid to retaliate" and was concerned about“ community shame."
This 34 - year - old woman says that she now wants to change an agreement as she continues to be damaged by what has been said.
The Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid from the Manchester United when the charges were reported, and this year you changed to the large Italian Youth party Juve in terms of £100 million.
Brexit: UK will always be 'always sorry' for the loss of car manufacturers
The UK will "always regret" if he does not lose his position as a world leader in establishing cars after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He has added that the Toyota UK has told BBC that if Britain leaves EU without a contract it will temporarily dry the product in its factory in Burkaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," says Mr Clark.
This Japanese designer said that the result of delay in the end of a contract with the Brexit could cause loss of jobs.
The Burnaston industry — which made the Auris and the Toyota Avensis of Toyota - has produced about 150,000 cars last year and 90% are shipped to other countries of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March the product will stand in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, director of the Toyota in Burnnaston.
Some UK car manufacturers have been afraid of leaving the EU without a contract in which trade with other countries will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, will close its Day industry in Oxford after the month.
Particularly disturbing is related to what automobile designers call a danger if we do not fulfill the Brexit agreements.
The Toyota product is being conducted "according to the need of the time", car parts arrive every 37 minutes from the surgeon in both the UK and the EU according to ordered vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a contract in March 29, there may be interference on the border of the industry that can lead to the lateness and end of the car construction areas.
It is impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day - long car than is built on their industry in Derbyshire, says the company, so the product may need to be stopped.
Mr Clark says that the Cheques's Cheques of Theresa May's future connections with EU is "to be carefully modified to avoid that check on the border."
"We have to get a contract. We want to get the best agreement we will accept as even as not only success now we will enjoy but also hold this opportunity," telling us the BBC Radio program.
"The evidence from not only the Toyota but also other industrys is that we need to be fully able to continue what has already been a successful team of surgeons.."
Toyota could not state how long the product will be stopped, but in time, she warns that increase in costs will reduce industrial efficiency and will eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallris, who has worked in Burkaton for 24 years and who has been connected to the Unitite Union company, says his members are worried: "From what I have seen if these jobs are gone again.
A government spokesman says: "We have put a clear and reliable plan for our relationship in the future with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein convention may be too late, says the White House
The eagerly anticipated conference of the Donald Trump and the general attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "ordered one week" as the high court war and the establishment of Brett Kavanaugh continues, says the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises a special committee operation by Robert Mueller, who checks Russia's election disturbances, the connection between Trump and Russia and possible violations of justice from the president.
Whether the Trump will kick the lawyer's partner in general, thus endangering Mueller's freedom, has given Washington news that can be discussed for months.
At the beginning of this month, reports The New York Times, Rosenstein discussed the hole to record the discussions with Trump and the opportunity of the president to be dismissed by a 25th trumpet blast.
Rosenstein refused the report.
But last Monday you went to the White House, although there are reports that you are about to quit work.
Instead, meeting Trump, at that time in the United Nations in New York, is announced to be on Thursday.
Trump said not to attack Rosenstein but the conference had started early so as to avoid conflict with the case of the Senate committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both became witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one - week investigation of the FBI for charges against Kavanaugh, which further reduced the full number of Seenates.
Trump’s journalist, Sarah Sanders, has appeared from the Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the convention with Rosenstein, he said: “The day of his appointment, whether this week, I think that will be postponed for another weekend as there are other things going on and on high court.
But we will see and like to keep the news on the news."
Some journalists may disagree with this: Sanders has never had a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The system administrator Chris Wallace has asked why.
Sanders said that the decline of these meetings is not because the news media is "smoking to talk," although she has said, "I will never deny the fact that they are talking."
He then suggests that the connection between Trump and the media will be several.
"The president made time for questions and answers more than any other president before him," he said, adding without giving evidence: "We have seen those numbers."
There will be meetings, says Sanders, but "if the media get the opportunity to ask questions directly from the president of the United States, that is much better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you have seen us do very much in the past few weeks and will take the place of a press conference if you will be able to speak to the president of the United States.
Trump usually listens to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public chat rooms or news agencies and respected guests.
He rarely asks questions in private.
New York this week the president likely showed why, at times, he did not care and sometimes by speaking thoughtlessly in front of the news.
Health Secretary writes to the EU workers in NHS in Scotland about what BBC fears
The secretary of Health has written to the EU workers working in Scotland NHS to express appreciation and desire for the world to stay in post-Brexit.
The Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter that was six months away from the UK.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to pay the necessary expenses for the EU citizens who work as public aid.
In his book, Nssz Freeman wrote: “In summer, conversations between the UK and the EU have quietly continued, looking for the results of this summer.
But the UK State has also been preparing its plans to be unconventional.
I know that this may not be the best time for all of you.
That is why I want to emphasize now how much I appreciate the work done by all the employees, regardless of their nationality.
Our fellow members from the EU, as well as elsewhere, bring with them a valuable dose of energy and abilities that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, to benefit the patients and the communities we work for.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay here."

The Tennesse State Tigersman Christion Abercrombie has had an emergency operation on his head on Saturday when they lost 31-27 by Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The Tennessee State instructor Rod Reed told the press that the injury occurred just before the vacation.

An official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris has added "no data about the type/size of damage at present" and Tennessee State tries to determine when the damage is done.

importers will be paid more than a pint when they buy a house in the UK
importers will be paid more than a pint when buying a house in the UK so that this money will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory programs
This will make it difficult for Corbyn to find young people to vote
Revenue of the institution will be required of those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Financial resources are expected to earn about £20 million per year to assist the homeless
importers in other countries will be paid for a modest kitchen if they buy a house at the UK - this will be used to help the homeless, and Theresa May will announce today.
This will be considered as an attempt to make it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to succeed in an attempt to win new people to rent more affordable houses and to be looked at by people who are earning more money.
The raising of camp funds will apply to people and businesses that do not pay taxes to the UK, and this added funds will help in the effort of the State to eliminate the homeless.
The extra cash - add to the present bottle’s cash, including high - quality labels placed two years ago in secondary and commercial houses - nearly 3 percent.
The bank expected this to give them about £120 million a year.
Some 13 percent of the new housing in London is bought by non- UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for the first buyers to find housing.
Most of the wealthy in this capital - now "city cries out" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time away from the country.
The new goal comes after several weeks Boris Johnson spoke of the reduction of the price of the site to help more young people get the first houses.
He is responsible for building projects by keeping up high housing costs by taking up a building site and not using it, and urges Mrsz May to block the quas in the purchase rooms to repair the Britain's "house shame".
Mr Corbyn has announced a startling series of supposed changes in the homes, including the control of rent and the removal of the house “infallible. ”
He also wants to provide lots of energy to build new homes.
Nkkz May said: "Last year I said I would contribute to a British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means making adjustments to the sale of houses.
Britain will always be willing to welcome people who want to live, work, and make life here.
It would not be easy, however, for non - UK people, as well as international companies, to buy homes rather than hardworking British citizens.
For so many people the dream of owning a house has become impossible, and the lack of dignity to sleep on the street never ends."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest desire is to be a Scottish instructor'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says that he has "a great desire" to be a Scottish instructor one day.
Ross, aged 42, wishes to help the North-East gang, now the third-rate One, is left with three points by the top team.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after helping St Mirren return to Scotish Premiership in the past trouble.
"I wanted to play my country while I was a player.
I got B tape and thus ended," Ross tells BBC Scotland's Sports.
"But I grew up watching Scots in Hammpden as a child, and that has always been my thought.
I can only have that opportunity, however, if I succeed as a teacher of a small group."
The pre-Sos in Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Ross, who was an instructor for the Alloa Athletic, says that he did not fear to join the principal in this large group, since he has rejected requests from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success will now be calculated if I can return this group to the Premier League?'
Because of the design and materials of the group, it should no doubt enter the Premier League, he said.
"It is not easy for me to get back there, but I’ll probably consider myself successful there if I can return this group."
Ross has been a teacher for only three years, after a short time as a instructor in Dumbarton and 15 months as a trained instructor in the Earts.
He then helped Alloa escape from the pot, and he turned St Mirren, which almost became the roast warriors of Championship in the next town.
And Ross says he feels more confident now than when he has been a performer in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
“ Things just changed completely," she recalls, by training Alloa.
"I was absolutely convinced that the training was worth it, more than being a player.
It makes sense because I’d play well, have a good life, and have some things I enjoyed.
But playing is not easy.
There are many things you need to do every week.
I still do those things when it comes to stress and pressure at work, but I love the training I receive.
I have a long time to train, and now I am doing it, and now I feel that I am doing something that I have always wanted to do for the rest of my life."
You can listen to a complete discussion in the Sportsund on Sunday, September 30, Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13 BST
The best time of the pint is 5,30pm Saturday, says a review.
The arrival of summer created heavy Britain’s lungs but heavily loaded the restaurants.
Groups of lung and rubber groups are up by 2.7 percent for consumers by July - but in restaurants have dropped by 4.8 percent, says statistics.
Peter Martin, of the mususesunsalcy CGA, who received these statistics, says: "The continued success and long-term involvement in England is expected of the World Cup means that Jly has followed the same course as the past month of June, when the lungs have risen by 2.8 percent, except that the restaurants cry below.
The loss of 1.8 percent in the food market in June has been worse by July.
Drinks and tubers sell far more than restaurants.
The lungs sell food that is hard to carry in the sun, although it has never been as bad as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to get out of them, and they will get some drink.
In the lungs andbas the sale of drink increases by 6.6 percent during the month, food is down by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, a humorist and reception RSM says: "The results have been progressive since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of large events or sports events will remain compelling reasons when it comes to market sales.
It is not surprising that food stores continue to be hard - pressed, although sales have dropped 4.8 percent annually in spite of increasing costs.
A long hot summer comes very dangerously to the food market and in time it will be seen that the lower temperature we have in August will give us what we need."
The increase in the sale of lungs and restaurants, including newly opened stores, was 2.7 percent in July, which indicated a drop in the amount of bills.
The Cffer Peach Trafficer unit of the stock industry of the UK department stores, collects and analyzes the working table of 47 working groups, which produces more than £9 million, and is the start of a developing model.
One out of five children has private accounts that he hides from his parents
1 out of 5 children - some 11 - years of age with secret chat rooms that hid from their parents and teachers, provides a review
A survey of 20,000 high school seniors showed an increase in the number of pages "false Insta."
News reports bring to mind the sexual needs of fellow believers
20 percent of the people who say they have a "the best" account do not show the children
One out of 5 - other 11 - year - olds opens chat rooms accounts that hide older people.
A survey of 20,000 high school seniors showed a rapid growth in the "Insta" accounts of "insta" - which refers to an Instagramy photo transfer.
The news media have built up a fear of engaging in sexual activities.
The 20 percent of those who say they use the clean "most" account do not show the parents, while they have some other secret.
One mother who somehow saw a secret code for her 13 - year - old daughter found a teenager who asked others to "sex her."
This study, of the digital Aarenesses UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC), found 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 with two profiles, half admitted to having private accounts.
HMC administrator Mike Buchanan says: "It’s disturbing that so many young people are tempted to build accounts on the Internet where parents and teachers won't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be "the voice of the players" on the Scotish Athletics board
Elidh Doyle is selected by the Scotish Atletics Board as the guide at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a famous Scottish player and chairman Ian Beattie has described this action as a good opportunity for those who administer sports to benefit from his wide share in sports involving other countries ten years ago.
"Eilidh is widely respected throughout Scotland, the UK and all the world players and we are confident that the Scottish games will benefit greatly by bringing him to the board," says Beatie.
Doyle says: "I’m determined to be the voice of players and I hope to be very generous and help in directing sports in Scotland."
This American athlete, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta between his four Olympic medals and who is now a common BBC knowledge, found himself unable to walk after a stroke (TIA).
He wrote to Twitter: "Last month I was paralyzed today.
I couldn’t walk.
The doctors told me that in time it would be obvious to me whether I was going to recover or how much.
Then I recovered sufficiently, learned to walk, and exercise today!
Thank you for the encouragement!
An advertisement for breast pumping compared mothers with cattle creates a breakdown in the Internet.
A company that pumps the breast provides a break from the Internet with an advertisement that compares breast - feeding mothers to beted cows.
In order to mark the presentation of what is supposed to be the first non-supervised breastpiece in the world, the multiplication industry of the journalists has issued an acoustic video to show freedom of the new lung that gives breast - feeding mothers.
Four mothers dance a song in a cow's song with the words: "Yes, I do, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't see this is not my breasts, my breasts."
The copra says, "Take it out, pick it out, nurse the children, pick it out, pick it out, pull it out, and feed my friends."
However, this advertisement, published on the Facebook page of this company, created a debate on the Internet.
The 77,000 video that has already seen and hundreds of concretes has received different views from viewers, when many say that you look down on the "burdens" of the milk industry.
"The worst decision to use cattle to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken a few days after they are born," writes another.
The Elvie grain camp is hidden inside the breast brush (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: "It’s a difficult situation for both mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise the breast tube of mothers who are unable to care for their babies?'
Another said: "This is not suitable."
Some protected the ads, and one woman admitted that she had found a song that was "laugh."
"I think this is a good idea.
I would buy it if I was still breast - feeding.
Switching made me feel like a cow.
The message is too big for me to see, but I have heard it.
This product will be truly useful," writes another.
Another has said: "This advertisement looks fun and refers to mothers who pump it (normally at work or in private rooms) and feel like "dogs."
This is not an advertisement that honors or judges the milk industry.
At the end of the video a team indicates that a group of celebrities had been dancing with secret tubes under their brushs.
The aim of the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast milk say they feel like cattle.
But Elvie Pimp, without sound, having no cables or tubes and wearing them hidden under the breast brush, has given women freedom to move, handle their children, and take them out of the tap.
Ana Bararin, a Mother's ECD partner, has noted: "Elvie Pimp is a product that will have a great impact and therefore it would be appropriate for the way to express it in a clear manner.
By likening breast - feeding women to cattle we wanted to place breast - feeding and all its challenges in public, while expressing in a pleasant and understandable way the feeling of relief of a new lung to bring.
This is not the first time that the Elvie camp has been popular.
During London Facsion Week, a mother of two children came from the cottelk designer Martha Jabowski using this product.
Hundreds of immigrant children move safely into a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children has increased even though they have not changed the number of months that have passed the border, partly because the strict police installed by the Trump office has made it difficult to provide support for children.
Often, many who do not approve of the lack of paper, and they have been afraid of putting their life on the list by identifying themselves as a parent.
The danger became worse in June, when the authorities announced that supporters and other adult members of the home would have to send hand - to - hand lines, and that the table would be handed over to the foreign authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the head of the Immigation and Customs Enforcement, admitted before Congress that this is binding many people who have written to support children without parents.
This prison later admitted that 70 percent of those arrested were free of criminal charges.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who are supportive or family members have been illegally treated, and a large number are criminals.
So we continue looking for those people," says Mr. Albence.
In an effort to have children prosecute quickly, the authorities have developed new rules that require some of them to appear in court during the month of detention, not 60 days later, which was a former rule, in accordance with the staff.
Most will appear on the video booth, not in real life, in order to request legal rights for the arrival judge.
Those who are considered unworthy will soon be deported.
If children stay in custody for a long time, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or to trying to escape, in accordance with helter personnel and reports released from the industry in the past months.
The attorneys say that this concern is growing in a larger facility like Tornillo, where the signs of a child’s strain may be ignored because of the size of the area.
In addition, taking the children to the camp city without taking time to prepare for them or to say hello to friends can create a lot of confusion they already have.
Syria tells the US, French, and Turkish forces to retreat immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wal al-Moualem has spoken to the Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in their country is now its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the assistant of the prime minister, has declared that foreign armies are illegal in Syria, that they will end terrorism, and "they will be treated properly."
"He must leave immediately without questions," he tells the audience.
Mouelem asserts that “the fight against terrorism is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2012, and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to "war this holy war to cleanse the rest of Syria" to terrorist groups and "any foreigner."
The United States consists of about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are more focused on training and commanding the troops of Kurdish and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in a war - torn country.
As for the refugees, Moulem has said that the circumstances allow them to return, and he blames the "certain western countries" for the fear" that the refugees may not return.
He said, "We have spoken with the international community and with the welfare of the people to see that the refugees are returning."
"They direct politics on a matter that should be handled only by the people's welfare."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help her Syria again until a political treaty between the Assad and those who are opposed to the end of the war has been made.
The UN agents say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a border on his last great Iddib stronghold is an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian alliance with Turkey has prevented the massive invasion of the Syrian army backed by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Mouelem insisted that the agreement was "for a clear time" and hopes that the soldiers will attack the jihadsts and the Nustra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, "who will be destroyed."
The UN General Staffan de Mistura hopes that you will soon arrange for the first assembly of a new committee that unites the government with opposing parties to form a constitution after the war of Syria and to plan the course of election.
Mouelem has put limits on the participation of the Syrian government to the committee, saying that the zone work should keep up by "keeping close attention to the articles of the new foundation," and warned of interference.
Why will Trump win the second option
In that sense, Mr. Trump can win a second option in 2020 unless, as there are many nonsmoking observers who may wish to be so, dishonest, and dishonest to remove him instead of president.
That will no doubt be the most momentous conclusion in the president’s history! ’
So far, there is no sign that viewers are getting tired.
Since 2014, CNN has increased to 1,05 million, and MNBC monitors have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News usually has 2.4 million viewers, ranging from 1.7 million in the last four years, according to the Nielsen, and the MSNBC "I Rachel Maddow Show" is the leading number of 3.5 million observers in hot night affairs.
"People are curious because we don't understand it," says Nel Baer, director of the ABC drama called "Desigated Survey," which is about the secretary of the cabinet as president after the attacks on Capitol.
Nell Scivell, who is in the world of writing and inventing the jokes called "Just the Funny Parts: And a Faw Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another idea.
You can remember receiving a text from Boston before the 2016 option.
The driver told him that he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
"He said, "Because he laughs at me," says Mrs. Scoll.
It is fascinating to listen to and observe such events.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, news from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, regardless of whether foreign families are reunited and the global economy.
Few people are aware of these facts.
And again, more than a knowledgeable resident when you find yourself sitting over a six hours watching the information network contradicts the use of Bob Woodward's "deep background" source in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort’s leather garment weighs $15,000 ("), says The Washington Post) and the straightforward description of Stormy Daniels that evaluates Mr. Trump.
As for me, in no way can I view Super Mario again.
"Some of the things he does that make it seem like a major program in human life is to give something every night," says Brent Montgomery, director of the Whelhouse Intertainment and the "Pawn Stars," which speaks of the change of people in the Trump system and of everyday conversation (triting with N.F.L., to praise Kim Jong-un).

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, the temperature was 80 degrees below his home in the north of Kauai, but he was inside the house watching the MSNBC while recording the CNN record.
They would not agree to leave before him, would not have happened as Brett Kavanaugh faced the Seenate Juicy Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is uncertain.
"I remember the old days doing all these distracting programs and people say, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," says Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seems that they were right."

Large financial assets are included in the choice of the middle- and middle- class of the House race.
It is not surprising that the 17th of 17th received large sums of money, thanks to the reemergement of the commencing regions of the contraptions and two officers in the same seat.
This newly painted Pittsburgh district puts him in the Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in one region in a special election last spring.
Lamb competes with another club, the Republican Keith Rothfus, now representing the old Pennsylvania district of 12, which runs the full height of the 17th.
Maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old provinces broke the foundation by votes to the Republican.
The race in this new 17 has removed the financial competition between the members of the large unit, the Democratic Congress Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a special March specialized choice for the many Pennsylvania people's 18th Congressional District.
The position of the Republican for more than ten years, President Donald Trump won the village for 20 seconds.

The U.S. considered to punish El Salvador by supporting China, and was rejected
The diplomas have noted that Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted Beijing, with little supplication from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a free meeting with the President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and was in a hotel in Panama until they removed the Trump Organization.
The State Department has decided to call again the American diplomatic commissions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama officials about "having a recent decision not to work with Taiwan," Heather Nauert, who speaks for the door, says at the beginning of this month.
But only El Salvador, with $140 million to help America in 2017, and to control the narrcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed payment, which includes the reduction of relief funds and divide limits on visas, may have caused pain for the Central America as a result of an increase in unemployment and murder.
As their meetings progressed, North American and Central America’s officials postponed a high conference focused on the protection and economic development of the same gathering last year that was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But during September, the chief executives made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively completing any idea of paying El Salvador.
President Mike Ponce now has to plan to speak with the conference, which is now scheduled to be in the middle of October, as a sign to the authorities at the conference, says the authorities.
And three American representatives returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without strong new instructions or punishments from Washington.
The White House of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two delegates, who agreed to discuss internal purposes of privacy.
Their accounts are verified by a external analyst close to the authorities and discussed the state of privacy.
A Lesson From History
The following incident may be the report of the special counselor Robert Mueller in opposition to the justice of Mr. Trump, and now there is considerable evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is said to be investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign was linked with Russia in its attempts to attack our choice.
If Congress changes, Mr. Trump will find himself facing charges against this body, as he prepares to stand before the voters, and perhaps finally before the court.
This has many implications, and I do not say that Mr. Trump’s fall will definitely happen to his fellows in Europe.
There are choices that all of us should make on both sides of the Atlantic will affect the length of this conflict.
In 1938, the German authorities were ready to set up the Coptic d "état" against Hitler, as long as the West was against him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we missed out on the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such factors, and endless efforts to wage the will of the masses are either strong or long gone.
Americans face many of these conditions now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump throws out Deliverance Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in trouble since the paper reported that last year, she had suggested secretly to the president and mentioned his failure to do his work.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times account is incorrect.
"How will we react if a new F.B.I. Brett Kavanauc is incomplete or unfair - or if it is brought to the Supreme Court despite the charge of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for the medieval Congress to appeal to Mr. Trump?
If we fail to do that, the will of the majority will not be realized for a long time.
But I believe we will fail, thanks to the study I had learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who had been exiled to Auschwitz, the same Nazi regime that once ruled my area.
She survived, moved to America, and, after 60 years, sent me to light candles on the Sabbath at a swastika table.
I have that as an inheritance, how can I have no hope for our future?'

Graham Dorrrans of Rangers hopes as the Rapid Vienna game approaches
The Ragers play at home with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that to conquer the Austrians, after playing the same size in Spain with Villarreal before this month, will put them in a better position to pass through the Group G of Eupa League.
A knee injury prevents stomach player Graham Dorrrans from replaying in agony for the first time until playing equals 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes that the Ragers can use those effects to look forward to larger things.
"It would be nice to get this point because Villarreal is a good team," says this 31 - year - old player.
"We went back to the game believing we were going to come back and find a point.
We may have found a doll to the finish but, otherwise, a balanced play is also good.
They play better than we do with the first box, and with the second box, we are better at playing.
On Thursday, we play another European game.
We hope that we will find three points, but they will be a hard game because they’ll play well in the past but because our followers will be encouraging us, I’m sure we’ll play and get the best out of it.
Last year the difficulty, during all the events of my injuries and changes in the organization itself, seemed to be coming to a standstill now.
The group is very good and the performers are happy; it is also enjoyable to be trained.
We hope we will work now, through the distress of the past and succeed."
Women do not sleep because they are afraid of the financial burden
Although the pollsters had a clear view of how to care for themselves and their families, few spoke to them about it.
Nearly half the people surveyed said that they had talked with their spouse about long - term bills.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be looked after by a family member, but they don’t take steps to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the national economy.
Let this begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to look after you if you cannot say anything about it.
Work with your mate and family to discuss how and where you will receive the needed care, since such decisions can have a terrible impact on your spending.
Give your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you find ways to pay off the bills.
Your long - term financial decisions may include a long - term insurance policy, a life - insurance policy that gives you money if you pay it to pay for these costs or become a health insurance policy as long as you can afford it.
Set up your legal rights: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health - care program so that you can arrange for someone you trust to care for your treatment and make sure that the doctors keep up with your wishes when you are not able to speak.
Also, consider the quarter of the attoney in your money.
You will choose a person whom you trust to make decisions for your finances and see that your pay is within your reach if you are in a position to do nothing.
Do not forget the details: Imagine your aged parent being rushed into a state of health and being rushed to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and their ailments?
Put such information in writing to make sure that you understand it correctly.
"Not only money should be viewed, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What drugs?
Who will look after the dog?
Have an existing schedule.

National prosecutors are seeking an unusual death sentence for the one accused of terrorism in NYC
New York State prosecutors are looking for a death sentence for Syphullo Saipov, a New York City terrorist charge that killed eight persons — an unusual sentence that has been passed on in this area on a criminal case since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is said to have used a government truck of Home Depot to attack on the West Side High Highway at Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and bicycle passengers on that route by Oct.
In order to punish the execution, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov had deliberately killed eight people and that he had deliberately ‘ deliberately wounded them physically, in accordance with an announcement of a death sentence, issued by the Southern District of New York.
Both acts have a bearing on the death penalty, in line with the judiciary.
Some weeks later, the trial court charged Saipov with 22 cases involving eight murders, often used by state prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a case of violence and road destruction.
The assault required "to organize and think well," the prosecutors said, explaining how Saipov did it as "bad, cruel, and horrible."
"Sayphullo Habibullaev Saipov injured, killed the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Erlij, Hernan Ferrruchi, Hernan Dieggo Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagucco, ” says a court report.
Five of the victims were visitors to Argentina.
It has been ten years since the New York Southern District last to handle the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with killing two drug workers but ended up serving a life sentence in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death sentence in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married after being found guilty of distributing the Soviet Union information during the Old War two years earlier.
Both of the Rosenbergs were killed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has indicated that he has no heart in the days and months following the attack, according to the court rulings.
He told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that something caused her to hit this way to watch SIS videos on his phone, in accordance with the words he said on the case.
He also asked to hang the IIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He said he was not guilty of the two sides which were set up.
David Patton, a public defense representative of Saipov, says "they are embarrassed as expected" by the court decision.
"We think that the decision to seek a death sentence is more than to accept a request to be released without the chance of release will only make it easier to be shocked in these cases to all involved," says Patton.
The Saipolv unit had asked the prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
The Information Based on NIGEL FRANCE, the Minister of Action, says that NIGEL FRANCE should supervise talks with Bruxit
Nigel Fage vowed to ‘ organize the society today' during a riot at the Tory conference.
The former head of the Ukip says that politicians had to be “truly tortured by the Eurosceticss - as one of the ministers of Theresa May says he should be the speaker and the EU.
A member of parliament, Peter Bone, told the protesters in Birmingham that the UK would have been released now if Mr Fage was the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Mrskz May faces in bringing her group members together is marked by the old Tory members who join a different protest against the city against Bruxit.
The Chief fails to keep his Cheques debut program running well despite the attacks of Brexit members, Remairs and EU members.
Some members have insisted that they would continue trying to establish a treaty with Brussels despite the conflict that existed — and have forced the Eurosceptics and the Labours to choose between his division and the crisis.
Mr Bone has told the Leave Men's Fight at Solihull that you want 'to finish with Cheques'.
He said that Mr Fage should be made a pillar and assigned to communicate with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we would have gone out now,' he said.
The Wellindridough Minister has added: 'I’ll represent Brexit but we have to finish with Cheques'.
Describing his differences with the EU, he says, 'We have not fought the world’s wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Mr Bone has issued proposals that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed their mind and they want to stay is not correct at all.'
Andrew Jenkyns of Tory, who supports the Bruxit, was also in a riot, telling the royalists: 'What I say: Lord, listen to the people.'
'People don't want Chequers, the anti-repetition party will not vote, our group will not want to see those on the streets and make us vote in the first place.
Please forget Cheques and begin listening.
In a specific command to Mrsz May, he said: 'The Prime Minister continues their duties if they keep their promises.'
Mr Fage told politicians that they should be “pressed, ” if they forget the decisions they made in the 2016 Yearbook.
'This is now a matter of loyalty between us - peoples and our political class,' he says.
'They try to be disloyal to Bruxit' and we are here today to tell them that 'We' won't automatically let you do that'.'
In a strong message he told the crowd, 'I want you to make me a political party, who are now on the verge of a exodus of Bruxit, and they feel pressured.
'We' use a country' that made us victorious in Bruxit and will not lose power until we become an independent, independent, independent United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the Remainers were rioting in Birmingham before a two - hour cry in town.
The principal officers were carrying placards Tories Against Brexit after group was formed this week.
The Labour member Lord Adonis has made the Conservatives humor of the safety problems they had with the team’s apricots during the opening of the conference.
'These people who tell us they can put into the IT and all the Canadian technology, a relatively safe limit, free trade without borders and Ireland', adds.
'It is complete destruction.
There is no good flash,' adds.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to obtaining the world’s nutrition after following the directions of the group that made him victorious over Sebastian Vettel
It was only evident when the Baltic Bottas succeeded beyond Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the directions of the Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the beginning, Bottas started off well and probably competed with Hamilton as he defended his position from the first two turns and invited the Vettel to attack a member of his group.
Vettel first entered the pits and left Hamilton to be stopped in the gangway, which should be the determining factor.
The Mercedes entered the pit after the cycle and was behind the Vettel, but Hamilton was behind the competition that made the Ferrari driver be forced to leave the inside safe after two years of safety in the third grade.
The Max Verstappen started in the back line of the grid and became the seventh at the end of his first cycle on his 21st birthday.
He then takes the lead in much of the race as he has continued on his wheels so that he can run to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkinon to the fourth.

A hard day because Valter had done a good work all weekend and was kind and let me pass.
The group has done a commendable job to have 1 2, says Hamilton.
Her Gout Is Rich
President Donald Trump made fun of Seenator Dianne Feinstein in the Saturday movement as he insisted that he did not show anyone a letter from the Christine Blesey Ford accusing High Court defendant Brett Kavanaugh on cases of sexual harassment.
Speaking to the West Virginia organization, the president did not speak directly about the evidence given by the Ford before the Seenate Juicy Committee, but he noted that what happened to Seenate showed that people were "indible and unkind and dishonest."
"One thing that could happen and the good thing that goes on a few days ago to Senate, if you see anger, when you see people angry and unkind, and cold and unfaithful," he says.
"When you look at the news torn and say "Oh, I didn’t do it.
I did not do it."
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feinstein, tell someone?
Can you recall his reply?
Oh, no.
I have not sent anyone."
Well, wait for one minute.
We have sent to him... No, we have not sent no one," she said, referring to anator.
Feinstein was sent to a document containing details of the Kavaught's accusation by the Ford back in July, and it appeared at the beginning of September - but Feinstein denied that the document had departed from his office.
"I did not hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I did not send anyone," Feinstein telling the committee, reports The Hill.
"You have asked me to keep it secret, and I have kept it as secret as she asked me."
But his objection was not well heard by the president, who has noted during the Saturday night meeting: "This is what I can say, his bodily movement is rich.
He may not have done it, but the movement of his body is rich."
Continuing his defense to the Supreme Court’s appeal judge, accused of three women of rape, the president said that the Democrats used charges in their profits.
"They are willing to fight for control of anything he can do.
He sees a lack of kindness, indifference, don't care about who is hurt, who should pass over to rule and control," reports the Mediaite in terms of the president.

Air traffic controllers die so that hundreds of passengers will be saved from an earthquake
An Indonesian pilot is praised after death to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers arrives safely on the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many have not been found after the great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which originated the tsunami.
There is a steady movement that continues to strike the area, and many are confined to two in the town of Palu.
But despite having had to run away to escape, 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave work on a building that was struggling to control the aircraft at Mutirara Sis Al Jifri Airport in Palu harbor.
He stayed to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track, would be able to move away safely.
He then jumps out of the control tower when he thinks we are losing.
She has died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for the Air Language Indonesian, Yohannes Sirait, said that this decision could save hundreds of people, reports the ABC News of Australia.
We have prepared a helicopter from Baligbopan in Kalimanantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we failed and have died this morning before the plane reached Palu.
"Our hearts are pained to hear of this," he has added.
Meanwhile, the authorities feared that the death toll could reach thousands as the relief agencies of this disaster say that it is not easy to enter the cities of Dongla, Siggi, and Botong.
"We believe that the number of dead ones is still rising as many bodies are still under rubble while many are unable to reach them," says gerontor Sutopo Pyu Nugroho.
Up to 20 feet [6 m] of waves destroyed the Palu to hold many people’s burial on Sunday.
Warships and transport bring relief supplies and life’s necessities.
Rsa Kusanga, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: Minutes bring dead bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The markets are stolen everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, director of the worldwide Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is a rescue team but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a disaster, but it can be worse."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the army: "I beg you all of you to work day and night to complete all the work related to human expulsion.
Are you ready?" Save CN.
Indonesia is struck at the beginning of this year by an earthquake in Lombok where more than 550 people are killed.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugin now says that one person is lost after a plane crash in Flagoon
The Airline that controls the crash of the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that there is only one person that is not available, after all 47 passengers and crews have been safely discharged from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini said from Saturday afternoon, she could not tell of a male passenger.
The Airline has worked with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The Airline did not respond immediately when asked to reveal details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boats have helped other passengers and crew after the plane is crashed into the water while trying to reach the Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities said that on Friday 7 were taken to the hospital.
The Airline says that six passengers remain in the hospital on Saturday, and all are in a less critical eye.
What caused the crash and how it happened is not clear.
The Airline and the U.S. Navy have both said that the lagoon had not yet reached the airport route.
Some witnesses think that the plane is over.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was floating in the water at low speed.
"That’s really a good thing," says Jayne.
Jayne and others were able to walk through the water which they keep in their waist to the emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were busy and speaking, and he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy says that nearby crews who promote the wharf have also benefited when people are released by means of a steamboat so that people can reach the shore before they fly a hundred feet [30 m] in water (100 knots).
The Data from Aviation Safety Network indicates that 11 people have been killed in PNG-regited aircraft crash 20 years ago but no one includes AirNigini.
Analyst marks the night of a woman who is burned alive
The prosecutor filed a charge on Saturdays for a man who was accused of burning a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for many hours as an expert witness in the field of antilysis.
He explained to the jury how he used telephone records to locate places that were visited by 29- year- old Quinton Tellis and a 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett found details about the location on a number of telephone calls that indicated that Tellis had a Cmbers on his late afternoon, contrary to what he had said earlier, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the details indicate that his phone was in Chambers during the time he had a friend; Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was right when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was "named because his truck was in Nashville."
Another exception was Tellis that he had known Chambers two weeks before he died.
Records of the telephone showed that they were to one another for a week.
Rowlett says that some time before the death of Chambers, Tellis closed Cley channels, telephones and communication information on his phone.
"He took him out of his life," says Hale.
The charge is planned to start talking on Sunday.
The judge said that he was waiting for the trial to be held in the jury’s office that day.
High Breed: What is cosciosp speed?
This hip group wants to challenge the negative views of this type of music by filling its songs with encouraging words.
The High Brew, from Bristol, says that the pit is no longer what it was at first by having political messages and discussing social problems.
It wants it to go back to the plants and create a console that can be restored.
Songers such as The Fuges and Commons have later seen the expansion in the UK in groups such as Akaka and Lowkey.
Someone black?
The NY child is accused of sending her parents away with a message showing "particularity"
A New York child security guard accuses a man and his wife of putting him away with unfair remarks after receiving a message from the mother of the child who mistakenly entered the term "I’m another black person."
The parents deny that they are prejudiced, saying that the charge has been made "for the purpose of making money."
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, you who have two children, expressed concern when he found that he would take care of his younger child, Giselle Maurice, a black man who arrived on his first day to work in 2016.
"NOWOWA NOOSO TO SOMEONE," writes Nkkz Plasco-Flaxman to her husband.
Instead of sending her to her husband, however, she has sent Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After seeing her supervisor, “not free, ” Plasco-Flaxman is casting out Mrs. Maurice, who, according to New York's New York City's Phos.
Nksz. Maurice was hired for a day and then was sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice accuses her parents of sending her out unjustly, and she wants a $350 compensation for six months, and she has been hired for her, without a contract.
"I wanted to show that, behold, that is not done," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know there is prejudice."
The parents answered that they were prejudiced, saying that Maurice was the good thing they had done, fearing that she would no longer trust him.
"My wife has sent him something he wasn't meant to say.
He was not prejudiced.
We are not prejudiced," says husband Joel Plasco telling the Post.
"But can you leave your children and a person with whom you had been rude, even unintentionally?
Your newly discovered child?
Of course."

‘ Will you attack such a person?
Not at all, "investment manual adds.
As the case gets under way, the open - minded court has promptly denounced the parents on chat rooms, not encouraging what they have done.
The Paddington printers were afraid that readers would not like the address file, revealing a newspaper
Bend’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born after this book had been loved, said in a book: "It’s hard to place yourself in the shoes of the person you are reading before it is published.
It is interesting to know now what we know of Paddington's success.
Her father, who has worked at BBC as a photographer before being moved to write a book for children about a small toy bear, which would not be disappointed if his work was not popular, added the 60th anniversary of his publishing of his books was "the pain and the joy" after his death last year.
As for Paddington, which he described as "the most important of our family’s welfare," he added his father was not proud of his success.
"He was a man of silence, and he was not proud," he told them.
"But because Paddington was so real to me, it was as if you had a child who did something: you brag about it even if it wasn't for you.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success that way.
Even if it was invented by him and thought of him, he would always give due credit to Paddington.
My daughter is dying and I have to telephone her
When her daughter is breast - aged, she is rushed to the Nice’s Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors work hard to save her life.
"Nad was always calling to say that it was bad enough, that he didn't expect to survive," says Mrs. Ednan-Lapehouse.
"I then received a phone call from Nad saying that he was going to die two minutes from now and that I had to close it to him.
I also greeted them.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, and I don’t come.
I will be with you in the near future.
I will be with you.
Chemotherapy treatments that were prescribed for her to continue her heartbeat slowly became less and less severe.
She had died some time before, and this had stopped working.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I could not cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on.
Eventually Mrs Mrs. Ednan-Lapehouse, now mourning her dead daughter, took a plane with other passengers - evidently because of the terrible condition she was experiencing.
"No one knew," he told them.
"I looked down, and tears rolled down my cheeks.
It is difficult to explain, but it was while on the plane that I felt sorry for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much I loved her."
A woman wraps up cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones in death work together to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been applying cards on the Welsh bridge with encouraging words and telephone numbers that people can use for help.
Nssz Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don’t want any parent to feel as I do every day," says Mrs.
Nksz Davis, who is 45, who lives in Sydney, says that his son was a cook with a promise of a future and that when he smiled, everyone would smile at him.
"Everyone knew his smile.
They always said that when he smiled, it was all right.
Nevertheless, she quit her job before she died, since she was "very depressed."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the first to find him after he committed suicide.
Nksz Davis said: "I’m always worried about something similar will happen."
Nksz Davis began making cards, "to let people know that they can talk to them, even if they are friends.
Don’t bottle up your feelings - you have to talk. "
Sksz Humphreys, who had been a friend to Mrs.
"He didn’t say he felt down or depressed or said something," he relates.
“ A few days before Christmas we observed a different way of doing things.
He said that on Christmas Day he was one way down when the children opened their presents without seeing it or doing something.
He said that his death put great pressure on them, but they had to cope with it: "It creates a tremendous void in the family.
It hurts us a lot.
But all of us must continue to fight."
If it is difficult to cope with the loss, you can call the Italians free of this number 116,123 (UK and Ireland), email jo@samarans.org, or visit the Samitarians's national website.
The future of Brett Kavanaugh is not valid as the FBI begins a survey
"I thought, if we could actually find something similar to what they had been looking for - a quick search, not a big one, that could bring about a crucial union," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "divided" since there were many who did not.
Why does Mr Kavanough and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
What they neglect is due to time.
The medieval option will arrive at five weeks, on November 6 - if, as is expected, the Republicans fail, then they will be weakened in their efforts to find a person who wants to be appointed to the highest court in this case.
George W. Bush has been making telephone calls to the Senators, encouraging them to support Sir Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Sir Bush and there he met his wife Ashley, who was secretary to Mr Bush.
What happens when the FBI has released its report?
There will be a selection for the Seenate, which has 51 Republican and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh would receive about 50 votes from Seenate, which would allow Mike Pennce, the vice president's vice president, to divide the equality and place him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s Sectures 'down' under Kim
The number of heretics in North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un began ruling seven years ago, says a South Korean law expert.
Park Bereong-seg, quoted the details of the South co-connection entrance, says that last year there were 1,127 - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park says that border laws have been enforced between North Korea and China and that the high cost required by private recruiting workers has had a major effect.
Pyongyang did not note anything in the community.
A large number of rebels from the North eventually receive citizenship rights in South Korea.
The Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Korea people have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled to China, which has a long border between North Korea and is much easier to cross than the Damiilitaled Zone (DMZ) protected between two Koreans.
China views the rebels as illegal, not refugees, and is often forced back into their countries.
The relationship between the North and the South still in war has in some sense been significantly improved in the past months.
Earlier this month, leaders of these two countries met at Pyonganga to discuss the development of nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the June conference between the US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on several methods of working to eliminate nuclear weapons in Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister R Yong-ho blamed the US authorities for not taking action since.
"Unless the US is confident, there will be no hope for the safety of our country and under those conditions, we will never put our own weapons first," says Mr R. in a talk to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "you are under control of feelings," saying that he is not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
The Head of the House's Small Association Nancy Pelosi called the person who may be elected by High Court Brett Kavanaugh as "insed by the emotions" and said that his emotions do not allow him to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelus says these words in a Saturday conversation in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I just thought that if a woman did this way, it would be said that she would be ‘ governed by emotions,' says Pelus by her answer in the words of Kavanaugh before the Seenate Judicy Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has honestly denied that he has struck Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while still young.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh expressed feelings, at other times intense and intimidating while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also cast off Democrats in the committee, called charges against them in an organized "information of human knowledge to be killed" organized by people who were suspected of Hillary Clinton's losing the election in 2016.
Pelus said he believed that the evidence of Kavanaugh indicated that he would fail in the Supreme Court, for it indicates that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he doesn't fit with those words and how he spoke about Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelos refused when asked if he would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and that Democrats obtained many seats from the House of Representantets.
"This is what I'm going to say -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or FBI, it means he’ll fit not only in the Supreme Court, but also in his present court," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi has added that as Democrat he is concerned that Kavanaugh may judge against Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is thought he is a judge who acts.
When questioned, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he could answer certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for an emotional person, who takes his side to the court and is expected to say, 'It was fine,' says Pelosi.
And women need to use their strength.
Appropriate reproof, months, and years of hot anger, and there is no other way to avoid it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Nksz. Steinem told me that 45 years later.
"I don't think that is unusual, what do you say?"
He added, "I was greatly helped by the woman who was a manager, who said that she cried when upset, but found out that when she was upset and cried, she was saying to her listener, "You may think I’m upset because I’m crying.
I am angry.."
Then he went on.
And I think that was good.
Tears flow as a way to let go of anger because they desperately need people.
One of my memories at my first job, an office full of men, when I found myself crying because of anger that I couldn’t explain, I was pulled to the back of an insubstantant manager that I used to pull me up to the stairs.
"Be careful that you don't ever see you cry," he told me that.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think that you are sad and will be happy because they have found you.'
Patricia Schroeder, became a Democratconswoman from Colorado, working with Gary Hart at the time she entered the selection.
In 1998, when Mr. Hart was caught in adultery on a ship called Mounty Business and was removed from the choice, Nksz. Schroeder, very angry, realized that he could not fulfill his desire to make a choice as president.
"It was not a well - thought - out decision," he said that to me, while he laughed some 30 years later.
"Then there are seven others who are in the race, and they're looking forward to another one.
One of you calls it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was about to end, he had no money to pursue, so he vowed he would not enter the race until he had earned $2 million.
It was a war I could not win.
He found that some of his supporters who gave him $11,000 million to men could give him $250.
"Do they think I get a failure?" she wondered.
In announcing that he would not perform an organized campaign, he was bombarded with expressions of appreciation for the support he had received, the frustration of a program that made it difficult to combine funds and seek out voters rather than for membership, and the anger at the discrimination of women in which he had been caught.
"You would think I was in," recalls Mrs. Schroeder and how the media responded to him.
"You can think Kleex will be a Jehoshaphat'sip.
I remember thinking, what will they put in my grave?
"You've been sitting down"?."
How trade between US and China can be useful in Beijing
The salvos that open the trade between the US and China have been closed, and since the war is still far from over, conflicts between these countries can be useful to Beijing in the future, say experts.
The U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning early this year by fulfilling the shipment sent to China, including electrical, iron, and aluminum.
The greatest accident took place this week with new freighters affecting $1,200 billion ($150 billion), by increasing half of all the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in the same way, recently placing 5 to 10 percent of American goods at $60 billion.
China has asked to be the same as the US specifically, and the second - largest economy in the world is less likely to fall in the near future.
To have Washington drop away means to close the corner with its requirements, but to bow down to the US can be very embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, researchers say that if Beijing can act wisely, the pressure of the U - trade war can reap China for a long time by reducing both economic interactions.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create economic conditions in both countries is far more dangerous than people who have ever seen it," says Abigail Grace, an Asian researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'is ready' for the return of the refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be willing to return to refugees and to seek help to rebuild a damaged war period of seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, foreign Minister Wal al-Moualem says that conditions in the world are improving.
"Today the situation in this quiet and safe environment is due to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he says.
The government continues to repair the area where terrorist attacks have occurred to restore normal living conditions.
All circumstances now allow the willing return of refugees to a country where they had to flee because of terrorism and the biased economic laws that plagued their day - to - day lives and way of life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people fled this one since the war started in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in this country need life’s necessities.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian empire could enjoy the help of rebuilding a war - ravaged country.
But he stressed that they would not accept any practical help or aid from countries where they would be inclined to rebel.
Europe conquered the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European group has won in 2018 Ryder Cup by overcoming the USA Group with some 16.5 - 10.5 points at the Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now been eaten six consecutive times in Europe and has never won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe also receives this prize as the Danish general Thomas Bjorn’s team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The US-pounder Phil Mickelson, who was heavily loaded in nearly all this competition, put his set-hot in water atpar-3 hole, his game was taken by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinori has played well in all his fields, becoming one of 4 to 5-0 since the current match formats began in 18979.
American Jordan Spieth was released by the lowest performer in the European team, Thorbjorn Olensen of Denmark.
The world's leading player, Dustin Johnson, won 2 and 1 by Ian Poulter, who may have played on his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cups team, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia won more than any other competition in Europe by 25.5 points.
"I don't always cry, but today I can't control myself.
This proved to be a difficult year.
I thank him for choosing me and for trusting me.
I am so happy, and I am happy that the cup was found again.
We work for a group. I am happy that I was able to help," said Garcia after winning Europe.
He transfers the work to his fellow-man John Ram, who divided the US compass of golf, Tiger Woods in 2&1 to the private players on Sunday.
"I’m really proud, by overcoming Tiger Woods, I’m growing up to see you," says 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record 13-2-3 in the Ryder Cup record.
The rare numbers of one of the most famous players in history, who has won the 14 great medals, is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA’s group is carrying hard for a whole weekend to get the feirays except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who competed in a high level during all the competitions.
US captain Jim Furyk has spoken after his team's bad game, "I’m proud of our players, they’re working.
It was early in the morning when we had put pressure on Europe.
We couldn’t.
You have worked for Thomas.
You are the best captain.
All 12 of her players are very good.
We will repair, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and will continue.
I love these 12 players and am proud of being a captain.
You should advise your captain.
We're divided. "
