An event of the rapid increase in colonavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
A growing event of coronavirus conditions (COVID-19) shows the same rates in European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom to ensure that, although in separate positions of the world, the accident of COVID-19 is going on rapidly throughout the world.
Based on the experiences of Italy, countries, hospitals, and crisis - care units should increase the willingness to accept many COVID - 19 patients who will need health care, and especially the care of those in crisis situations.
In 31 December 2019, a group of people with unknown ethan properties were reported at Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of the new coronavirus is now called the end of the respiration syndrome cryonicus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the resulting illness of SARS-COV-2 has been named coronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence thus far indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 are suffering from a serious illness, that is, a respiratory infection that is associated with or not associated with pneumonia, and most of these people are recovering.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 is developing into a very serious illness that requires hospitalization while 6% of the remaining cases face a serious health problem requiring attention.
The death of victims of COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine the accounts of the growing problem of COVID-19 in each European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those in the Hubei Province, China.
It also compares the current number of people with COVID-19 in the EU/EA and UK and that of Italy during January31–15 March 2020.
The circumstances of COVID 19 in the EU/EA and UK
After China, COVID-19 was widely spread in areas and the change in the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide at present follows what is happening in the country.
On 11 March 2020, the General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is a epidemic.
The 5 March of Eurosurvellance 2020, Spileri et al. reported the first confirmed COVID-19 in Europe that corresponds to the definition of WHO.
In the EU/EA, the first reliable men reported to France on January 24,20 from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
By March 15, 2020, the COVID-19 people had been found in all 30 countries of the EU/EA and the United Kingdom (UK), that is, between 31 December 2019 and that day, 39,768 people who had the virus and 1,727 deaths, in this case 17,750 infected people and 1,441 dead people who had died were only Italians.
Identifying an increasing number and growing event of COVID-19
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (IECCC), statistics for people with COVID-19 in each country worldwide, obtained only by legal resources such as the World Health Organization, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are returned each day by 8:00 a.m.
This date was used to analyze the COVID-19 EU/EA and UC, and compared with those in Italy.
As a representative of the exception of the ongoing features of COVID-19, we calculate a broken - up event of the 14 days of COVID-19, thus considering the natural progress of COVID-19, in each EU/EA and UK, during the January 1,–15 March 2020.
We also introduce a growing number of the reported world conditions on 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared with Italy at 31 January 15] March 2020.
In the EU/EA and UK
The growing number of broken - by-cuted costs of the 14-day conditions of the EU/EA and UK countries usually follow those of the Hubei Province (China 1).
In all of the EU/EEA and the UK, the growing event of the COVID-19 began to climb in about 21 February and was very active on 28 February 2020 (Ready).
This is greatly increased by the rapid increase in the number of reported conditions from Italy, but all other EU/EA and UK countries show the same high rates for the growing problem of COVID-19 (Reading Aid).
The image 2 shows the increasing number of conditions of COVID-19, in EU/EA and UK countries compared with that of Italy during January 31,–15 March 2020.
It makes sense that, at 15 March 8:00 a.m., some 15 countries of the EU/EA and UK had already reported a total total of less than that of Italy in three weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of reported conditions of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EA and UK.
The costs mentioned in the growing event of COVID-19 show that the epidemic is continuing at the same rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that the countries are divided in different positions, the diversity in the public health - care procedures, and probably different definitions of conditions in countries as well as various protocols that should be studied to ensure the status of COVID-19, including follow - up tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian states described the situation when 10% of COVID - 19 patients needed attention and the media reported that hospitals and emergency units in these areas had reached their highest level.
The data for importing COVID-19 in a hospital and/or emergency unit is found in the EU/EA section only in 6% and 1% of cases, in sequence (darates not shown).
It should, however, be gathered in an orderly way to correspond with the present date of watchfulness that focuses on the number of reported conditions and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed significant differences in the availability of emergency beds and central care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 emergency and central care beds for 100,000 people by 2010–11).
To imitate the factors associated with the prevalence of health care, which provides the average of each EU/EA and UK state for the increase of conditions in the hospital due to COVID-19, 90% of the risk of passing the number of emergency beds, is given a sixth return of an ECDC test of an early accident in the OVID-19.
Since conditions are prevalent in certain areas in the EU/EA and UK countries, and emergency hospitals and units usually assist certain people of the region, knowledge about conditions and emergency care beds should be available at the extent of the Nordicial units for statistics 2 (UNTS-2).
The experiences from Italy and current abroad show that the cry for COVID-19 is rapidly growing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and units of serious care must prepare for the ongoing cooperation of the SARS-COV-2 manager as well as the increase of COVID-19 patients who need medical attention, and especially emergency care, such as that takes place in the affected areas of Italy.
As shown in a recent ECDC study of an emergency, a quick, active, and thorough method is essential to delay the circulation of SARS-COV-2, by changing the control system to a reduced course, since the expected rapid increase in the number of conditions may not enable the DOs and hospitals enough time to understand, of accepting and adapt their responses to the proper way if they are not used in time.
An early examination of an accident also refers to public health measures to control the effect of the epidemic.
There is a small gap in which the nations are unable to continue to control their control efforts in order to reduce the increase of SARS-CV-2 and reduce the pressure in health care.
Failure of this, some EU/EA health clinics will likely face a host of patients who need the care of serious conditions in the days or weeks to come.
The outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the sere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CV-2), currently killing more than 3,000 people and treating more than 880,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, which has been successful in human disaster.
Like its same virus, SARS-CV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CV-2 may also be passed from bats and cause similar symptoms.
The COVID-19, however, has a greater risk and mortality rate than SARS, but it is more passed and is treating more adults than are younger and more male than women.
As a response to the fast - growing number of new cases, the article is trying to offer a time and more brief return on a subject of rapid research.
We will discuss the basic factors concerning epidemmiology, biology,ology, diagnosis, treatment, cause, and prevention of disease.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that this return helps to understand and eliminate the threat of an infectious disease.
The January 25,20, Spring Festival has become an incomparable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who are encouraged to stay in their homes on vacation and for several weeks thereafter because of the outbreak of new virus.
The virus is much like the coronavirus (ICV) that caused the outbreak of a sere respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CV-2 is World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and a related disease was called COV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world and about 50 others around the world.
On March 2, 2020, the virus led to the more than 80,000 confirmed conditions of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients released from the hospital and more than 3,000 patients who died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "a leading public enemy" and may be more powerful than terrorism.
According to Pub Med (https:/www.ncom.nlm.nov/pubbmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 pages were printed on the COVID-19 which includes itsvidology, epidemism, eitology, tests, and treatment since the first report on January 7,20.
This review tries to supplement the progress of research regarding a new and rapid development.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by COV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012).
We will also consider what we have learned so far about prevention and the causes of disease and other vital questions that remain.
CVs that are generally viewed as non-invasive antibiotics in humans, mainly responsible for 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have had two major cases with the CoVs, namely, SARS-COV and MERS-CV, which caused the epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, in sequence, and soon spread to other countries that caused serious illness and death.
Therefore, the present COVID-19 is the third manifestation of COV in recorded human history.
As shown in Death. As.1.1.1, the rabies with unknown origins began to be reported at Wuhan on December 31, 2019 in China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the succession of the CV was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death event was reported in Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic spread rapidly into neighboring cities, districts, and countries.
On January 20, a combination of health workers was reported, suggesting that interpersonal connections were possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed and all public transport equipment was established.
On January 24 the first medical study of the disease reported that, of the 41 patients whose condition is confirmed, only 21 had a direct contact with the Wuhan food market that was considered to have begun to be a disease from an unknown source.
On January 30, WHO announced the outbreak of a global health emergency.
By the time of the report, the disease has spread throughout China and in about 50 countries around the world (Death.2).
As the situation deteriorates rapidly, the outcome and risk of the epidemic is unknown.
On February 11, 2020, a study of 8,866 patients including 4,0221 who were convinced that they were infected with COVID-19 showed a more redefined picture of the epidemic in the following way (https://mweixin.q.com/s/UlBI-HX_HPXA1qHHA).
The SARS-COV-2 has been ill for all age groups, but mainly 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of the cases were more than 50 years old, fewer than 20, and only 14 patients less than 10.
The SARS-COV-2 has caused more males (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The COVID-19 grew in major Hubei units and nearby.
The COVID-19 took an average of 5 days (2-9) from the beginning to the test.
The average duration was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from the beginning to the death to nine days (4.8-13).
The basic remuneration number 3.77 (95% KI: 3.51-4.555), and the modified R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people concerned rose rapidly before 23 Jan.20, which was similar to the time of the great transport before the Spring Festival in China.
The deaths of confirmed patients were 1.44% (95% KI: 1.10 1.86%), and the number of deaths changed by all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main factors of the accident of COVID-19 were sex (humans), age (icode60), and critical pneumonia.
COVs are part of a family of large, hidden microorganisms that contain one RNA nerve fibers.
It can be divided into four parts, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and deleteta, that is, alka and beta are not known to join people.
The Spike (S) of the glycoprotein envelope adheres to the angiotsun-conning enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the pipe feedyl paste 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CV and MERS-CV, respectively, and then the joining of membranes.
The RNA gene is released from cryplasm; after a recurrence of the gene gene, RNA of a gene connected with the glycoprotein and nucleocapsid proteins make up cycleocaps, which include a plasma membrane to release the virus.
A series of early SARS-CV-2 genes was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-COV-2 was found to be a new type of Beta-CV with 99.98% of the ten successive samples gathered at the first stage of the attack, the Huanaan Seaod Market in Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is usually more similar to SARS-CV than MERS-CV.
Using electron transmission micros, SARS-CV-2 molecules were found in the most visible parts of the epithelium airway for humans.
The ACE2 people were found to be the SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CV.
However, S S S S-COV-2 profile includes an ACE2 human being much faster than that of SARS-CV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CV-2 is causing less risk to patients than SARS-CV.
The SARS-COV-2 can also build a new short protein produced by the orf3b and the output protein produced by the orf8.
The SARD3b of SARS-CV-2 may play a role in the virus's ethogenicity and may prevent the appearance of IFNNAME; however, the orf8 does not contain any known background or modeof.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the building of aclo-EM of people with a full height of 2.9 Å Å associated with amino acid vehicle B0AT1.
It was found that these links, with open and closed buildings, were included as a dmer and the ACE2-B00AT1 combination of S protein, which provides evidence of the sight of the CV and interconnection.
B00AT1 may be a medical unit in demination so that the SARS-CV-2 infections can be imposed.
Root and centre layer
It is known that both SARS-CV and MERS-COV began in boats and passed on to the people with civet cats and lawyers, one after another.
By comparison of SARS-CV-2 and other COVs, bats are recognized as the origin of SARS-CV-2 as the new virus corresponds in 96% with two SARS from bats known as SL-CVZX45 and SL-CVZX2-CVX11.
However, the identity of the agent involved helped the virus to cross the border between creatures so that it can join the unknown, and the transmission line will still be clearly identified.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes may be carrying a virus from bats to humans that involved a combination of common elements within S.
According to research, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggest that pangolins - with long noses, ants that are commonly used as traditional Chinese medicine — they may be the central environment of SARS-CV-2 based based on 99% of the KoV found in pangolins and SARS-CV-2.
However, the 1% variation spread between two genes makes a big difference; therefore, the proven effects of strong femininity are maintained (Death. 333).
SARS-COV-2 factors are currently unknown.
The SARS-COV and MERS-CV can survive without a creature for 48 hours in a dry area and up to 5 days under 20 degrees and 40%-50%.
The SARS-COV-2 may have the same factors.
It is reported that SARS-CV-2 does not respond to ultraviolet radiation and 56 degrees Fahrenheit [56 ° C]; ether, 75% of ethanol, a microbe that contains chlorine, peric acid, chloroform, and other solvents, but not chlorophydine, can make the virus effective.
Usually everyone lack immune defenses against SARS-COV-2 and is thus in danger of getting new infection.
At present, no detailed research has been reported on the reactions of the immune system to SARS-COV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to past studies of other COVs, especially SAERS-COV and MERS-CV (Death.4).
Usually, after the infection has infected the body, it is first identified by the natural receptors of the immune system (PRRs) that include cactitors such as C c, receptorlike receptor (TLR), a receptorlike receptor (NLR), and a receptorlike I (RR).
By various means, the virus causes the display of inflammation, the development of the body cells of the Dendritic cells, and the production of I interferrons (IFN) that absorb the spread of the virus and speed up the macrophage phagocytosis of the virus.
However, N SARS-CV protein may help the virus to escape the reactions of the immune system.
Soon, the immune system’s responsive response joins in the battle against the virus.
T lymphocytes that combine CD4+ and CD8+ cells play an important role in protecting.
CD4+ T cells encourage B cells to produce antibodies against the virus, as well as CD8+ cells that directly kill infected cells.
The helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CV can prevent T cell failure by producing T Opptosis cells.
Insufficient of the Humual along with such aids as C3a and C5a and the immune system are also important in combating the virus.
For example, the immune system derived from a restored patient renders MERS-CV useless.
On the other hand, over - the - counter reactions of antibodies create large amounts of medical facilities in which there is no great damage to the lungs and other body organs, and, in the worst of all cases, the failure of many organs and even death.
SARS-CV-2, which has a primary element as a group, has many chances of treating older occupant patients as well as pregnant women.
It is not uncommon for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have a risk burden - bearing immune systems have a higher chance of contracting themselves than other people.
The estimate for the period of the SARS-CV-2 is 1-14 days, most times 3-7 days based on the study of the first 425 persons in Wuhan.
However, a survey of 1,099 people indicates that the nursery period was 3 days on average and had a length of 0 to 24 days.
Recent research, as described above, indicated that the operating period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on the knowledge of 8,866 people.
It is very important for health authorities to change the time of their silence based on the correct oral period, thereby preventing infected people from passing the virus on to others.
As a general rule, people who are exposed, or infected, have to be confined for 14 days.
Should the closing time be extended to 24 days?
The fever is usually a primary symptom of COVID-19, which may not correspond to symptoms or other symptoms such as no coughs, shortness of breath, muscle pain, headaches, sore throat, rheumatoid arthritis, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia in one week after the onset of the disease.
In critical cases, patients progressed rapidly to severe respiratory infections, septic shock, metabboliic acidis, and cogengapathy.
Patients with fever along with/or respiratory and serious fever symptoms, even if no unusual substances are seen in the lung image, should be diagnosed for early tests.
A public information study conducted at the end of December 1920 showed a percentage of the symptoms that said 98% of fever, 76% of gonorrhea, 55% of dyspnea, and 3% of diarrhea; 8% needed to breathe with electronic aid.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of family groups as well as a group based on the role of nonsignists.
By comparison, a study of human information in 2012 showed that MERS-COV patients also had fever (98%), non-financial cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them had to breathe with the aid of a machine, much more than with COVID-19 patients and that is in accordance with the highest level of MERS's murder than the COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and pain throat (21%) were also noted for MERS patients.
For SARS patients, it was shown that fever (29-100%), non-flammatory cough (29-75%), dyspnea (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were major symptoms and breathing with the aid of the machine was required for about 14%-20% of patients.
On February 14, the death due to COVID-19 was 2% when the confirmed patients reached 56,576 worldwide.
By comparison, the deaths caused by SARS in November 2002 were 10% of all diagnosed cases of 8,096.
In the MERS, based on public information research in June 2012, the death was 37% of the 2,494 patients.
The first survey reported that the R0 of SARS-COV-2 was high by 6.47 with 95% of the 5.71-7.23, where SARS-CV was 2 to 4.
An SARS-COV-2 MERS-COV and SARA-COV comparison with their symptoms, death, and R0 is represented as The Table1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-CV-2 have a much higher capacity of explosives than MERS-COV and SARS-CV, but is less lethal than both.
Therefore, it is far more difficult to control the SARS-CV-2 epidemic than the MERS-COV and SARS-CV.
The start of a group often takes place within the same family or at the same time of the same gathering or of a transportation vessel.
Patients usually have a history of visiting or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with in - laws or patients two weeks later.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that hospital patients who have been discharged can also carry the virus, which gives a warning to increase the time to shut up.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in earlier classes.
For example, the lymphopian has a white blood count < 4 ×109/L that includes the number of lymphocyte < 1×109/L, as well as high levels of aspatte amnotranspherase andviremia found in 1,099 cases available from OVID-19.
The levels of liver and liver enzymes and amyoglobin were high in the blood of some patients, and C-reacticive protein and erthrocyte code were high in the blood of many patients.
For serious patients, D-dier levels, the product of the breakdown of the fibrin in the blood, was high, and the rate of lymphocyte was remarkably low.
An unusual discovery was found in the radiography of many patients with COVID-19 and with two-pounders or groupd glass in the lungs.
Patients are often affected by unusual pneumonia, critical lung damage, and acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS).
When ASDS occurs, uncontrolled swelling, increasing fluids, and increasing fibrosis make the gas distribution dangerous.
Poor performance of the type I and the form of pneumocyte reduces the level of surfactant and increases the tension of the upper area, thus reducing the lung capacity and increases the risk of lung loss.
Thus, the worst results of radioography are often similar to the most serious condition of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first polypological analysis of COVID-19 showed the outbreak of pneumonia, the formation of hyaline membrane, and the introduction of Interstitial lyphocyte, as well as the detection of immune syncytial cells in the patient’s lungs, accompanied by a pathology of the disease and ARDS and similar to those of SARS and MES patients.
RNA's discovery of SARS-COV-2 using re-transctage polymerase plymerase (RT-PCR) was used as a major test on COVID-19.
However, because of the high number of non-productive toxins, which could speed up the epidemic, medical observations began to be used when testing (not only RT-PCR) in China on February 13,20.
A similar situation arose when an SARS test took place.
Therefore, a combination of the history of disease, medical evidence, laboratory examinations, and radiation effects is important and vital for successful diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Fong Zhang team explained the program to use the SERLOCK system based on SARS-COV-2, receiving the non-natural parts of SARS-CV-2 in 20 × 10-18 mol/20 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies for each frames) using a device for a time without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that a new approach will greatly enhance empathy and benefits if assured of medical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with new COV, doctors can primarily provide support care for COVID - 19 patients, while trying a variety of methods used or previously developed to treat other COVs like SARS-CV as well as MERS-CV and other infectious diseases (ITElab2).2).
This treatment includes current and possible antimicrobial therapy, immunonosuppressants, steroids, plasma from patients, Chinese medicine, and mental aid.
It is even recommended that the blood plasma of the right patients be used as a treatment.
The pharmaceutical firms compete to form a defense against the virus.
SARS-CV-2 primarily attack the lungs first and probably again, on a small scale, some body organs that identify ACE2, such as a respirattrintal and the kidneys.
Nevertheless, poor work habits and lack of breathing are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Therefore, the support of breathing is essential in order to treat symptoms and save health and include normal oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, air conditioning, and air conditioning, as well as the use of biodegradable equipment in the case of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be based on the use of an extracocorporaal metrial immune system (ECMO), an improved method of cardiopulmonary surgery used to treat heart failure or life - threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, the storage of electronic licenses, the prevention and treatment of second additions and septtic shock, and the prevention of vital organs are also important to patients with SARS-CV-2.
It is known that Cytokine storms are the result of excessive reactions of antibodies to SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine is the reaction of the flashing program with aspects of the release of the cytokin chain, including TNF, IL-1-2, IL-6, IL-6, FN - FN, FN, FN, FN, FN, and MCP1.
These cytokines encourage the immune system to release large numbers of free medical agents that are the primary cause of ADDS as well as the failure of many organs.
The stress of the immune system is important in the treatment of Cytokines, especially for serious patients.
Crticosteroids and toyilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclons, have been used to treat the cytokine storm.
Another treatment for the immune system of Cytokin storms includes the control of the body’s reactions directed in the T cell; the prevention of IFN-ger, IL1, and TNF; the recognition of JAK; the name of the JAK; the llinatumamusb; the pressure of the use of the cytokin; and HDACs.
steroids, such as ammonosuppressants, are widely used for SARS therapy to reduce the risk of inflammation.
However, steroids in high levels have not benefited from serious lung damage to SARS patients and COVID-19.
Rather, it may cause unpleasant side effects, especially vascular osteonecrosis, which interferes with prognosis.
Nevertheless, a short process of corticosteroids at lower rates to middle levels has been recommended for careful use of COVID-19 patients who are seriously ill.
At the time of writing, no effective treatment against infection had been established.
However, remedessivir, nucleotide analog, was found to be effective in the American patient who has COVID-19.
The Remdesivin is a new antibiotic that was first developed by Gilead to treat bacterial infections in Ebola and Marlburg.
Later, the reimsir also showed that it could prevent the bacteria in the RNA with a single layer of bacteria that include MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has provided the Chinese element to carry on research for SARS-CV-2 people, and the results are considered red.
In addition, barititinb, interferon-%02,lopinavir/ritonavir, and rubin have been elevated as possible treatment for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious reactions may occur after a combination of lipinavir/ritonavir treatment.
The relationship between these treatments and other medicines used by patients should be noted carefully.
Plasma from improved patients and immune systems
The collection of blood for recovering patients to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from infection rather than long history.
In fact, recovering patients often have a high degree of immune responses to the disease in their blood.
The immune system is immune globulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes in order to fight diseases and other nonbody factors and to detect different cells from disease and make them less effective directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of recovering patients in COVID-19 and was transmitted to 10 patients in a critical manner.
Their symptoms were better in 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral enzymes as well as improved oxygen levels in the blood.
However, confirmation and clarification is needed in order to make a widely used application before any treatment is developed.
In addition, in view of the side effects of treatment, some of the side effects associated with plasma should be considered seriously.
The immune system, for example, can extremely promote the reactions of the immune system and cause Cytokine’s release, which may be life - threatening risks.
The amount of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma is great if patients are to be treated in an emergency.
It is very difficult to build and produce certain immune systems as soon as possible for a global epidemic.
For this reason, it is very important and reasonable to distinguish the B cells of the recovered patients and to be marked with genetic codes that have active genes or to select the immune system which works to represent the important proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various types of diseases in China for thousands of years.
Its effects, however, are largely dependent on the combination of many parts in various forms to which the diagnosis is based on TCM.
Most of the working parts remain unknown or even vague as difficult to sift and verify such components or combinations that work best.
In the meantime, because of a lack of effective and accurate treatment of COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major treatments for minor symptoms to the middle of those who are recovering in critical stages.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du pills and the Lian Hua Qing Wen have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
High rates of treatment for COVID-19 were noted in many Chinese states who used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninxia (50%), and Hunan 50%), while the province of Hubei, using TCM, about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had a lower degree of recovery (13%).
This, however, is an unfavorable comparison as other factors of the number and importance of patients should be included.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and her colleagues published research on comparing Western medicine (WM) alone with WM therapy plus WM and TCM.
They found that the times needed for the body temperature to recover, end the symptoms, and hospitalization were short of the WM+TCM group with only a WM group.
Even more impressive, that the severity of symptoms (from small to serious) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than a WM group (7.4% compared with 46.2%) and death was less than the WM+TCM group (8.8% compared with 39%).
Nevertheless, TCM operations and safety still await well - managed research at large levels and facilities in many areas.
It can also be impressed that the course of action is noted and made clear that the active components of TCM treatment or combinations are possible.
Patients with suspects or confirmed that they are suffering from COVID-19 often have a serious fear of a highly contagious and death - dealing disease, and people who are confined to them again bend, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and serious side effects of treatment such as sleep apnea can lead to increased anxiety and mental depression.
In the first phase of the SARS explosion, many mental - health - related illnesses that include persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, neurological disorders, mood disorders, psychiatric disorders, and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
A series of rigid communications and closings, as part of public health response to the outbreak of COVID - 19, may cause many people to feel anxious and guilty about the consequences of joint involvement, closing, and burial in the family and friends.
As a result, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having it, people in contact with them, and the general public.
Psychiatry should include the development of mental health centers for many areas, clear, regular and accurate interactions with regard to SARS-CV-2 outbreaks and treatment programs as well as the use of electrical therapy as programs to avoid close contact with others.
Practical goals are essential in order to break up a chain of link between animals and humans connected to a target that may be pointed to and is often in line with the treatment of antibiotics in the control of new viral infections.
Efforts have been made to achieve goals based on S S protein to create longer and more effective antibodies and to kill as well as/or prevent lack of SARS-CV.
The goals for weakened hunting have been studied in animals regarding SAS.
However, these biological functions were intended for adults as well as for challenging challenging models and for their protection against infection from animals and humans will still be discovered before medical research begins.
This is because the SARS has remained silent 17 years ago and no new illness has been reported since then.
On the other hand, the rare conditions and groups of MERS continue to rise from the Middle East and spread in other areas as a result of the persistence of biological sources from animals to humans in sick areas.
IRS vaccines have been developed by the use of a non-invasive virus, DNA plasma, virus veriftors, nanoparticles, microorganic crystals, microorganins, and subdivision units, and some have been tested in animal models.
The building of a safety and practical goal against SARS-COV-2 in the participants is an urgent and important job in controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to withstand the difficulties because of the long period (an average of 18 months) required for a goal and the changing types of CVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full treatment program for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without the consequences of a previous disease.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is again associated with a higher rate of sickness and death among serious patients.
Therefore, designing a model for the cause of the disease is essential to health care agencies to put their screens first, especially in areas with small help.
Based on medical research that has been reported so far, the following factors may affect or be linked to the cause of COVID-19 (The Table 33) patients:
Age: Age was the most important factor in the cause of SARS, which is also true of COVID-19.
The COVID-19 appeared primarily at the age of 30-65 and 47.7% of those patients were more than 50 in the survey of 8,866 patients as described above.
Patients in need of care for serious conditions had a higher chance of treating other diseases and complexities and were significantly older than those without them (66 age compared with 51), suggesting that age is a factor in the effect on COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CV-2 has caused more men than women (00.31/100,000 compared with 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Already existing and complex diseases: COVID - 19 patients who need serious care have a high risk of serious heart injury and arthrhythmia.
Heart - related events were also a major cause of the death of SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-COV-2 is also able to adhere to ACE2-Post- post-Congocytes, which may lead to liver failure for COVID-19 patients.
It is good to note that age and already existing disease are related to strength and may be confusing.
The effects of an unusual laboratory: The level of C-reative protein in the blood (CRP) indicates an emergency of inflammation or muscle damage and has been raised to be a potential cause of disease, reaction to treatment, and complete recovery.
A link to CRP level is also being made with the emergency caused by COVID-19.
In addition, high lactate dehydrogenese (LDH), ASST, Alaniine amnotransphere (ALT), and creatine cinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely displayed in most organs, especially in heart and liver, and are released during muscle damage.
As a result, they are common signs of heart failure or liver failure.
Major medical symptoms: chest radiology and short - term progression of medical symptoms should be considered along with other possible side effects and complexity of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As described above, immunosuppressant steroids are commonly used as a treatment for a combination of infectious diseases in order to reduce the risk of inflammation.
With a high number of corticosteroids applied to patients with critical SARS, most of the survivors were suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with a permanent disability and a poor quality of life.
As a result, if necessary, steroids should be used at a minimum and short time for COVID-19 patients.
Depression: As described above, during the cry of COVID - 19 many patients suffered as much stress as they had to endure long periods of closing and much uncertainty and see the death of close family members as well as their fellow patients.
It is important that mental counsel and long - term support be given to help patients recover from stress and regain normal health.
In accordance with human knowledge research up until now, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological features in SARS.
In addition to a frequency in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-COV-2 is able to double in the above airway and cause small or non-invasive symptoms in the first stage of contact, the same as common CVs.
Therefore, patients involved in the first grade or period may produce a large number of infection during everyday activities, resulting in great difficulty in the control of the epidemic.
However, the combination of SARS-CV was thought to occur when patients were very sick, whereas most infections never occurred in the first paragraph.
As a result, the cry of COVID-19 is more critical and difficult to control than the SARS explosions.
There are many current efforts in China that include the Wuhan ban on the surrounding cities and the continuing closing of the entire population in hopes of hindering the transmission of SARS-CV-2.
While these measures have serious economic and other world conditions, the number of new patients is dwindling, indicating a reduction in the rate of the epidemic.
The most promising estimate is that the revolution will end in March and the slowing stage will continue for 3-4 months.
Some scholars, however, are skeptical.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the effect of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CV-2 may hold two thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-COV-2 were found in both mid-turtbinate and in the throats of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly discovered virus may be a recombinant class.
However, promising signs come from China based on the declining number of sick young people, which indicates that the current techniques may be effective.
At first it was predicted that Ebola would take over a million people and that half a million people would die.
However, because of severe pent - up and deep - seated isolation, the disease is eventually controlled.
It may be, as SARS-COV, that SARS-COV-2 may become weak and may eventually become inactive or become a milder virus able to deal with people.
A comparison of the COVID-19 with SARS and MERS is given below (Death.55).
SARS-COV-2 is most likely to be in contact with infected substances.
The virus was also recovered from the tracheotosis, which presents a new opportunity to pass away from the egg to the mouth.
A recent study of 38 patients reported that 41% of patients may have been admitted to hospitals, including 17 patients who had previously had other diseases and 40 health care workers.
Hence, greater precautions should be used to protect people, especially health - care workers, health - care workers, family members, workmates, and even people who live near patients or individuals who are affected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; both the use of surgery masks and N95 respior (a series # 1860s) helps control the spread of infection.
Facial masks block fluids from a person who may have slipped into the air and stick to the face of things, where they can be passed on to other people.
However, only N95 masks (a series # 1860s) can protect you from sniffing small calories from 10 to 80 nm, while only 5% of the affectedions are able to pass completely; SARS-CV-2 are the same size as SAERS-CV both about 85 n.
As the cells are able to pass through five combined surgical masks, direct medical personnel and patients must wear N95 masks (a series # 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, health - care workers should wear adequate protective gloves to reduce contact with germs.
Germs can infect an individual with the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor joined SARS-CV-2 although she was wearing N95 mask; the virus may have entered her body by entering her eyes and getting up.
As a result, health - care workers should also wear face - to - face masks that cannot be displayed or mirrored when working with patients.
In normal communities where it is affected or perhaps affected, it is highly recommended that everyone wash his hands with soap and water many times more often than usual, try to stay in the house to keep quiet and to get in touch with people who may be involved.
A distance of three steps is considered to be the right distance from patients.
These steps are practical ways to reduce the risk of infection and to prevent the spread of infection.
Although the SARS-COV-2 came as a new virus in the world of humanity, having the same structure as the SARS-CV as reported on January 7, 2020 should have been a warning in China because it still remembered the SARS explosion in 2003.
However, until 19 January 2020, the director of the Center of Disease Control in Wuhan reassures citizens that the new virus has little in common and has little regeneration from one person to another and that it is not a problem to prevent and control disease.
This message made the public cautious, especially when the whole country was preparing for Spring Festival, and they missed a critical time to control the virus while it was still in Wuhan.
Chinese disease - control agents may learn from this crucial study and make important future progress.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more careful when they make public declarations as each word is important to the citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) feel and respond more to information from a clinic rather than wait for legitimate reports from doctors or officials; (3) prevent them from controlling what might be a scourge in their first stage instead of trying to comfort the public; and (4) more frequently do so as to promote public awareness of the disease and development of the public health and development of the social health services at certain times.
A cry of COVID-19 caused by a new SARS-CV-2 by the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 other countries throughout the world at the time of writing.
Since the virus is much like SARS-COV and symptoms are also the same between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 created the feeling that SAS is in repeat.
However, there is a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is essential for controlling the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects more old people than older men and men than women, and the risk of death is higher than the young.
SARS has a mortality rate higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared with 1.44%).
COVID - 19 patients pass the virus even when they have no symptoms while patients with SARS pass it when they get very sick, which causes a much greater problem in controlling COVID-19s than SARS.
This explains in part why the SARS-COV-2 is spread much faster and more widely than the SAERS-COV.
A normal RNA of SARS-COV-2 may be toxic to some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been treated may also experience fluency in screening for infection.
This discovery greatly increases the risk of infection infection.
Since there is a rapid progress in the COVID-19 research, a few serious problems remain to be resolved, including:
Where does SARS-CV-2 come from?
Although there is 96% of the gene structure between SARS-COV-2 and two COV bats like SARS, we cannot conclude that SARS-COV-2 is coming from the boats.
Which animal was in the center that transmited the virus from the first colony, say bats, to humans?
If we don't know the answers of#1 and 2, we can't successfully break the transfer, and a riot can be worse at any time.
Although cell models and biochemic analysis have shown that SARS-CV-2 stick to ACE2, how does the virus actually enter the respiratory cells and cause changes that cause the resulting illness?
Is the virus also attached to cells that show ACE2 in other parts of the body?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot come up with a quick, accurate, and effective diagnosis.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How do the genes of a virus change during human interaction?
Will it be a global epidemic, or will it end like the SARS or will it be worse from time to time as a cold?
It is important, but it may take some time to ponder the answers to the above questions and countless other questions.
Regardless of how much cost, however, we have no choice but to prevent the epidemic as quickly as possible and restore our health to normal.
The origin of the virus from animals to human coronavirus
The change and flexibility have encouraged coronavirus and its organization, which includes people, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two COVs (HCOVs) were known as the cause of minor illnesses, such as common colds.
The explosion of the sere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERRS) has changed to indicate how much damage HCV can cause and endanger life.
The appearance of SARS-CV-2 in China in the late 1920s again placed CVs in the theater and surprised us with a high degree but with reduced ethogenicity compared with her sister SARS-COV.
HCV is a zoonosis and an understanding of HCV's origin may help us.
Most HCVs come from bats and do not cause illness.
The middle observers of some HCVs are also known.
The identification of animal predators has positive effects on the prevention of human diseases.
Research on the relationship between the CV organization to animals may produce important insights regarding the development of CV to humans.
In this review, we present a summary of the already existing knowledge about seven HCVs, and we will focus on the history of their discovery and their origin in the ozone layer and the interaction of various species.
More important, we compare and divide the different HCOVs in the view of the alteration of the virus and the combination of genes.
The current COV epidemic of 1920 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for the changes of the biotechist successfully and the effects of the virus’s alteration to the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) are part of the Coronavihidae family, which consists of a closed, close - up, one - sided RNA virus group.
These bacteria contain the largest 60 to 32 pounds [32 kg] of the RNA virus known as "CV" because of its highly memorphology, which resembles a crown under the electron microscope.
According to a building, the COVs have non-gens that do not have the same order.
Nearly three parts of the root consist of two large double-screen frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), translated into refraction polyprotein polyprotein and p1abs.
Polyproteins are further processed to build 16 more proteins without structure, called ansp1 became a becameer16.
The remaining portion of the frame contains the ORS of the building, including the spike (S), the envelope (E), the membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
The number of profiscises related to the list also has a list of various CV ranges.
Based on the sequence of proteins, CVs are fitted in four categories (alpha-CV, beta-CV, gamma-CV, ramta-CV), where the beta-CV field contains most HCVs and is divided into four columns (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and mice are the source of the alpha-Cov genes and beta-CVs, while birds are the source of gamma-Coves and delta-CV.
For thousands of years, Covs has continued to escape the boundaries of creatures and most of them have become fundamental to humans.
So far, seven COVs (HCVs) are known.
Among them HCOV-229E and HCV-NL63 are Alpha-COV.
Other five beta-CV consists of HCV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, sere acute respiration systemronavirus (SARS-CV), the Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CV) and SARS-CV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 often produce small symptoms, such as normal fever and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and newly identified SARS-CV-2 are a major cause of serious respiratory problems, resulting in a severe respiratory infection in a multitude of patients that contributes to a higher risk of developing acate respiratory disorder (ARDS) and other diseases that occur without the lungs.
The first version of HCOV-229E, B814, was distinguished from the noses of common cold patients in the mid 1960s.
Since then, more information has been obtained on the detailed HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43, both resulting in automatic symptoms.
In fact, it was accepted that HCVs are generally safe until SARS outbreaks.
The rise of the SARS in 2003 is one of the most tragic events in modern history, which caused more than 88,000 cases and had a mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a continuous epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with an occasional elasticity in other parts of the world.
The new HCV (2019-nCOV), later named SARS-COV-2, is the cause of the ongoing outbreak of colonic disease of 1920 (COVID-19), which kills more than 3,120 people and infects over 91,000 people on March 3,20.
The alame has been weeping again and the world should be ready for the coming SARS-COV-2 epidemic.
All seven HCVs have a source of zoonotic from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Much evidence supports the origin of all HCVs from bats, in which bacteria properly adapt to their condition and do not cause illness but show a variety of genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented major medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and in the world.
A tracking of HCV's origin provides a framework for understanding natural history, force, and speed factors of jumping.
This can also guide or assist in considering the cause, which is in the middle with the production of copies of the SARS-CV-2-2-to-2-do, which will have significant effects on future transmission prevention.
In this return we draw a summary of the origin of the zonootics, a combination of different organisms and HCV-pathogenesis.
Especially, we highlight and discuss the same piece that the parent viruses of HCV usually cause no sickness in their natural environment but that they cause sickness after a combination of various creatures with a new virus.
It also replaces the rent of HCOV conversions when an increase in friction usually comes and the decline of the ethogenicity.
The effects of continued SARS-COV-2 are discussed in this context.
Animal Cocos have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first division of HCOV-29E type, B814 in the openings of patients who had contracted common cold, various CVs were separated from various animals of various kinds, including galin, mice, mice, cattle, pigs, cat and dog.
Over the past decades, seven HCVs have been discovered.
A short summary of the history of HCOV discovery in sequence (The Table 1) may benefit and teach.
The first type of HCV-229E was distinguished from the respiratory respiratory capacity of patients with high  respiratory infections in the year 1996, and was accepted to develop in air lines of WI 38.
HCOV-229E patients had symptoms of normal fever, including headaches, coughing, malaria and sore throats, and fever and coughing were seen in 10 zero20%.
Later in 1967, the HCV-OC43 separated from the muscle tissue and the subsequent chain in the brain of nursing rats.
The properties of HCV-OC43 treatment seem to be similar to those caused by HCV-229E, which were not distinguished from other respiratory infections such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
Both HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43 are spread around the globe, and they are often joined during the winter season in good weather.
Usually, the two infections are less than a week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy HCOV-229E people are exposed to mild mild flu.
Only a few patients with depressed immune systems showed serious respiratory problems.
SARS, also known as "simmonia", became the first recorded HCV epidemic in human history and is the cause of SARS-CV, the third discovery of HCV.
The first illness caused by SARS can be followed until late 2002 in China’s Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic led to a report of 8,096 sick people and 774 dead, scattered in many countries and countries.
In addition to the main, it was estimated that each event could cause at least two other events, during a 4- to 7 - day spray and the rise of the infection on the 10th day of illness.
Patients associated with SARS-CV at first seemed to be suffering from imilgia, headaches, fever, malaria and fever, followed by dyspnea, coughing and breathing stress as later symptoms.
lymphopiania, abnormal liver operation, and high creatine cyanese are among the rare characteristics of ordinary viruses due to SARS.
The spread of an alveolar, the explosion of the epithelal cell and the rise of macrophages are marked for SARS patients.
At least 20-30% patients need emergency care and air ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many body organs that involve the nervous system, liver, and kidneys can also contribute to these critical conditions, which are often associated with the cytokin storm, which may kill especially patients with antibodies attached to the immune system.
The virus was first separated from open lung surgery by a relative of the first patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made in connection with HCOV research.
The HCOV-NL63 was separated from a 7-year-old Dutch child by the end of 2004.
It was first found to be on the increase in young children, in older people, and in dyslexia patients who were exposed to respiratory infections.
The discovery of coryza, conjanctics, fever, and bronchiliitis is common to HCV-NL63.
One independent study described the isolation of the same virus from an 8 - month - old pneumonia boy in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, in reality it is spread around the world.
It has been estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of normal respiratory infections, and its high risk occurs early in summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstractive laryngitis, also known as a macro.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was separated from a 71 - year - old man who was admitted to a pneumonia and bronchiotis hospital in Hong Kong.
Apart from hydraulic and bronchiotis, HCV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acoustatic acidation.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing short respiratory infections.
All these available HCVs are well adapted to people and often have little chance of changing into the most throogenic diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons as in the case of the most lethal HCV-NL63 type, reportedly cause serious respiratory infections in China.
Often, when these HCVs gain the ability to easily enter and maintain themselves in an ongoing state within the population, they also kill or less peripheric.
The MERS-CV was first separated in 2012 from a 60 - year - old patient’s lung with serious pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the conditions confirmed are from the Middle East, imported conditions are spread to nearby targets reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another second explosions occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 conditions confirmed.
The appearance of MERS treatment is similar to that of SARS, which is marked by a progressive emergency hormone.
Unlike SAS, many patients with MERS suffer serious kidney failure, which is at present different from MERS among HCV diseases.
More than 30% of patients have the symptoms of estrogen, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Since February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 reported cases with high mortality rates in 34.4%, resulting in MERS-CV is one of the most dangerous germs to humans.
From mid-December 2019 to its end, many patients with pneumonia known as related to SARS-CV-2 were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization called the outbreak of lower respiratory respiratory infections caused by SARS-COV-2 as a Public Health Emergency to Concern the World and named it COVID-19.
On March 3, 2020, there were reported 90,053 patients in the world, with 3.4% of deaths.
Significantly, the number of deaths in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while one outside is 1.2%.
SARS-CV-2 causes serious respiratory infections such as SARS-CV and MERS-CV, which have been detected as fever, coughs and dyspnea.
Patients also suffer from diarrhea.
The pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can make rapid progress to acupitory stress syndrome.
Although SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar because of the same high sequence of nucleotides of 82%, there are different classes in the branches of the phylogenenetic tree.
SARS-COV-2 appears to be a little thogenic but much more related to SARS-CV and MERS-CV.
It is reported that there are people who have no symptoms with SARS-CV-2 and may be responsible for its rapid worldwide increase.
Comparing and dividing SARS-COV-2 with the other six HCVs produces a very interesting similarity.
First of all, the menstrual period and the duration of the HCV syndrome are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-COV-2 follows the normal rent of six other HCVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 is between SARS-COV and the four HCOVs obtained in the community (that is, HCOV-299E, HC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-COV-2 shows the characteristics usually seen during the failure of HCVs to be found in the community, which includes a lack of clear symptoms, minor symptoms or lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, the lower set of emergency conditions of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the condition of SARS-CV, though the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the SARS-COV-2 link also showed interesting tables with both HCVs available in the community and SARS-CV.
On the other hand, the transfer of SARS-COV-2 is as high as that of HCOV acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it will still be determined whether the transmission of SARS-CV-2 is slowing to people as in the state of SARS-CV and MERS-CV.
Finally, like other HCVs, SARS-CV-2 can be found in fossils in the wild.
Whether the SARS-CV-2 oral transmission plays an important role in the SARS-COV under certain conditions is still to be explained by future investigations.
It is also of great interest to see whether SARS-COV-2 will show the appearance of certain seasons as is the case with the HCVs available in the community.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CV-2 which involve its inter-covation, ethogenity and maintenance increase after passing to the people will have a final effect on the end of the ongoing cry of COVID-19.
All HCVs found in the community are responsible for small signs that are perfectly compatible with people.
From one point of view, it may also be true that people are well compatible with the four HCVs.
In other words, both probably survived the old HCV epidemic.
HCVs cause serious illnesses in humans, and people with HCV are no longer present.
To this end, HCVs must go back to the people to the extent necessary to allow for the growth of changes that are in harmony with the factors associated with the birth of the system.
In this way, if the SARS-COV-2 eruptions persist and are contributing to many people, there will be a great opportunity for them to be more cooperative with the people.
If they are highly compatible, their intervention may be difficult to prevent by closing it or by other means of controlling friction.
For many years, four CVs have been found in society around society, causing common colds in people who have the right response to antibodies.
These germs do not need an animal’s source.
In contrast, the SARS-CV and the MERS-COV in Pathogenic are still far from compatible with the people and their interaction between the people is unable to be preserved.
They need to keep themselves in shape and grow from their biological source and want the opportunity to pass on to the target, likely by one or more middle layer and raise strangers.
SARS-COV-2 have the same characteristics as both SARS-COV/MERS-COV and the four HCVs received in the community.
It depends as much as the HCVs are found in the community, at least in the original creation.
However, the ethogenic is much more than HCV from the community and has less ethogenic at SARS-CV or MERS-CV.
It is still to be seen whether it will be fully compatible with humans and revolve around the source or the animal’s center.
Before discussing the origin of HCV animals, it will help us to discuss the meaning and characteristics of evolutionary, biological, biological, internal, and HCVs.
An animal becomes a substitute for HCOV if we hold a closely related ancestor with a high degree of nucleotide sequence.
The original virus is usually highly compatible and does not cause the new one’s illness.
Similarly, the source layer holds HCV continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the perpetrators are naturally infected and are natural HCV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCV is moved back to the middle or middle of the population, it is not well compatible with the new environment and often causes illness.
The medium can be a biological resource for human involvement and play a role in fostering a virus that allows it to multiply for a brief period and is passed on to humans to increase population levels of infection.
HCV can experience a final intervention if it is able to maintain its involvement inside the centre of gravity.
In contrast, HCVs are able to adapt to the middle tide and even develop long-termism.
In this setting, the central plant becomes a natural spring.
A map of epidemiological indicated that back in view the patient who is the SARS signal patient had a history of contact with hunted animals.
The subsequent studies of the proprietors indicated that the IgG had a higher IgG against the SARS-CV compared with the number of ordinary people.
The masked palm civet (pakaka varvata) and the racoon in the biological market have been found to carry viruses similar to SARS-COV.
This was directly supported by the fact that no more SARS reported after the killing of all the Cives in the market.
However, it has been reported that some wildmas have been exposed to the wild masked palm civet or the unrecognizable markets of living animals in the SARS-CV, suggesting that the markd palm civet may be a middle - but not a natural source of SARS-CV.
Significantly, 80% of the various Guangzhou animals have a immune system against SARS-CV, we are unable to ignore the possibility that many mammals are the main breeders of the SARS-COV.
All of these appear to be the last SARS-COV players.
A subsequent study of the SARS-CV natural wildlife produced a COV closely related to the bat, called SARS-related Rwinopus bat coV HKUM3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCOV HKUM3), which is found on a Chinese horse-shop.
These self-explicably supercompetitive bat as to the immune system against SARS-CV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCV HK3.
This and other bat-subs divided by 88-92% of nucleotide sequences and SARS-CV.
These studies have led to the development of a new theory that bats could attract new species of humans.
CVs like SARS (SL-CVs) are marked on bats, but not except those called WV1 are able to be classified as a living virus.
People are known as SARS-CV client.
The WV1 adopted from a bat dung sample was shown to use a bat, civet and ACE2 people as an incoming cell.
Interestingly, the radiation of the SARS patients was capable of destroying WEV1.
Until now, WV1 represents the closely related ancestor SARS-COV to the bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotides's chemical sequence.
Although there is a high degree of oxygen between these two bacteria, it is generally believed that WV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CV and the bats had a nearby SARS-CV virus.
Xylogenic analysis includes MERS-CV and the same group as the CV-HKun4 bat and the COV-HKUR5 bat.
The CV-HKU4 of the bat and MERS-COV use the same organization's compliant, pipe feedyl perptidase 4 (DP4), on infection entry.
A series of RNA polymerases which depend on the RRS-CV's RNA is closely related to their European and African beta-COV-obsed beta-cvs.
So far, no ERS-CV is alive in wild bats.
The MERS-COV and its nearby COV-HKU25 bat's relatives shared only in 87% of the nucleotide's chemical sequence.
As a result, bats may not be the nearest source of MERS-CV.
On the other hand, surveys in the Middle East have shown that camels from the sextant have been in the immune system directly killing MERS-CV, like camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
A living MERS-CV-like virus found in humans was separated from the camel nose tube of the dromedary, which further shows that camels are the real source of MERS-CV.
It is also noteworthy that it was usually seen by small signs but the greater release of the virus from the camel that is transmitted by MERS-COV through research.
Significantly, not only by the respiratory tract but also through the mouth - to - mouth tube, which is also the primary route to infection from bats.
However, questions remain as most MERS patients do not have a record of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, either a human interaction to one or unknown intercombine systems involving unknown animals that are in the care of MERS-CV.
SARS-COV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide's CV RaTG13 bat separated from Rinolopus afinis.
As with SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the variety of sequences between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is too large to be assigned a parent's relationship.
That means, bats may have had a nearby source of SARS-CV-2 except when a similar similar boV was discovered in the future.
It is estimated that the SARS-Cov-2 game enthusiasts should be among the wild animals sold and killed at the Huanaan Seaod Wheele Market, most of which were associated with the first problem of COVID-19, which indicates that there may have been an event of contact from animals to humans.
A few recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may be harboring older beta-Cov-2 related beta-V-2.
These new gengolin COV levels are divided by 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence and SARS-COV-2.
However, they are related equally close to RATG13 for about 90% of the degree of nucleotide sequence.
They combine into two subgroups of bacteria that resemble SARS-CV-2 on the phylogenenetic tree, one of them sharing the background of the most similar territory (RBD) and SARS-CV-2, with amino acid sequence of 97.4%.
In sharp contrast, the RBDs-COV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although there is a high degree of high degree of genomic sequence.
A previous study of sick pangolins reported the discovery of infected joints in lung samples, which appear to be related to SARS-CV-2.
The study used various methods of construction and hand-organism to form a sequence of a section composed of about 86.3% of the total length of the virus's root system.
We are not able to set aside the chance that pangolin is one of the nearby SARS-COV-2 species.
However, at present there is no evidence that the pangolin is a direct source of SARS-COV-2 due to the differences in sequence between SARS-CV-2 and SARS-CV-2-Congolin related to beta-COV.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is much shorter between SARS-CV-2 and SARS-CV-2-2-congolins related to beta-CV.
The SARS-CV-2 conversion effort on bats, pangolins, and other mammals will yet be discovered.
Although high-quality is found in RBDs between SARS-CV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CV-2 related to beta-CV, SARS-CV-2 and RATG13 share high levels of gene.
There are high suspects that the higher level of contact between the RBS-COV-2 Pangolis related to beta-COV and SARS-CV-2 is conducted by switching contact.
Another suggestion recommends the recombination between SARS-COV-2 pangoli related to beta-COV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal.
As the force of evolution, recombination is spread among the beta-COVs.
The conclusion has not yet been reached regarding the origin of the nearby SARS-COV-2-2.
In addition to the very high HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCO1 are also investigated.
Phlogenetic evidence has shown that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E may have started in the bat, while the parent bacteria of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 are found in rats.
It is reported that the ARCV bat (Aplachian Ridge CV) discovered on a three - color ball in North America displayed a relationship close to HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was related to another album, called Himpoderos/Gana Kwam/19/208, which was discovered in Ghana, while camemerids have been accused of being its nearest support.
To clarify it, the current information about the origin of known HCOV animals is reached in Picture 1 and Chapter 2.
A biogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the similarities between HCV species in history.
When the HCV-OC43 was moved from another animal to man from domestic animals about 1890, the respiratory plague was recorded.
The history of the interconnected HCOV-2229 is not very clear.
Alpha-Cov bat connected to HCOV-229E.
Among them is the alpha-CV of the alpaca.
A few evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First of all, people not the alpacas may be contacting bats in the same environment.
Instead, humans are close to the alpacas.
Second, alpha-CVs related to HCV-2229E are varied and does not cause infection in bats, while the alpaca'sal Alpha-CVs caused an increase in respiratory infections in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CV of the Orpah has not yet been found in wild animals.
As a result, we cannot ignore the possibility that thelpacas get the alpha-COV associated with HCOV-229E to people.
In fact, bats are a direct source of bacteria that cause people to become ills that include the bacteria, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats may be able to transmit HCOV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, when the Alpha-Cov bat works as a group of HCV-229E genes, alpacas and hydromedary camels may be a middle - class transmitting virus to humans, as is MERS-CV.
The MERS-CV is a good example of a combination of different species from bats to hydrometry camels to humans.
The origin of MeRS-CV conversion from bats is known for its first identification and is strengthened by the following findings.
Evidently, bats give different kinds of bacteria the opportunity for genetic differences between different animals and a combination of different animals.
Long life, crowded colonies, close community and powerful flight skills are all ideal conditions for bats to become a good agent of the virus.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has been introduced to hydromedary cameras for hundreds of years.
It is well suited to these repentant camels to become the center layer of sustainable energy as a natural resource.
MERS-COV causes little illness and has a lower rate of change in these animals.
Its involvement to humans is a mistake and people remain the last MERS-COV wave since its transfer can be preserved.
Unlike the camel's role in the MERS-COV transfer, the role of the pangolin, if present, in the SARS-CV-2 distribution is different.
In particular, beta-CV in pangolins cause a serious illness in the pangolins.
She may be the last match of the battery-COV related to SARS-CV-2, such as carves in the SARS-COV condition.
SARS-COV-2 chances from animal to human beings should be taken into account or not from future research.
First of all, bats may be a source of infection related to SARS-CV-2 similar to SARS-CV-2.
People may play the same role as bats by performing autopsies or by drilling coal.
Second, the pangolins may be a growing middle-growing agent in which the virus related to SARS-CV-2 has recently been set up.
People are infected with the disease through surgery and the use of raw meat.
It is possible that most mammals including domestic animals may be exposed to SARS-COV-2.
A study of animal conservation and wildlife conservation is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and reconciliation of SARS-COV-2 may happen in the third association of both bats and pangolins.
The considering of the SARS-COV-2 animal is still continuing.
Apart from the various kinds of animal breeders, there are three main elements on the side of the virus that are important in making COVs across the border of creatures.
First, its high number of changes in RNA repeat.
Compared with other RNA bacteria with one fiber, the amount of rate of alteration of COVs may be considered "little" to "higher" depending on the rate of change of 010-4 per year at each 2 centre, depending on the level of the CV to new entertainers.
CSVs have axorinnuclease for looking for errors, the removal of them results in extreme changes and loss of energy or the inability to develop properly.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analge Remdesir is known to suppress the frequency of COV by suppressing this xobonnuclease and RNA polymerase dependent on the RNA.
Remdesir is one of the most promising components of the SARS-COV-2 to be studied in medical research.
Nevertheless, the rates of change for CVs are about one million times higher than those of non-compliant.
In addition, the number of changes is usually higher when the CVs are not properly in harmony with the environment.
Compared with SARS-CV with a high number of changes, the number of changes SARS-COV-2 appears to be lower, suggesting a higher level of human tolerance.
It is thought, it may already have been accepted by another social network.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this applies again to MERS-COV, which is well matched by hydrometric camels.
It is estimated that genetic mutations may cause the goals and antibiotics against SARS-COV-2 to slow down.
Second, the large RNA root in the CVs uses more flexibility in the transformation of the configuration and recombination, thus increasing the probability of a co-evolution of various creatures, which is beneficial in the appearance of new CVs when conditions are suitable.
This is supported by many different reading frames and the function of the protein produced by the 30° Geome.
Third, the live CVs alters the states separately during RNA repeats in a different way for the "selection" option.
In the compass, a change of type occurs regularly during the CV RNA scan.
RNAs of mostly full length and subgenomics may meet together to form new COVs.
Phylogenic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCV-HKU1, HC43, and animal coVs such as SL-CV for bat and bat-HKU9.
HIV / immunodeficiency in connection with
Apart from the three components of the virus mentioned above, the link between the virus and the maternal parasite is another major factor affecting the interaction of different species.
Here, the reuniting of SARS-COV is regarded as a general example, which presented evidence of the wider selection between the events of the combination of different species.
Based on the comparison between separate persons and SARS-CVs in civet, it is estimated that SARS-CV deals with immediate reaction to different players, especially with changes in RBD for Sphront S.
Usually, RBD in the S CV-S team cooperates with the cell server and is chosen firmly for the response of the pilot's immune system.
In SARS-CV, RBD is in 318 amino acids to 510 part of S1, which adheres to the human ACE2 and its creceptors for infection.
The SARS-CV is able to see the ACE2 participants of different animals, including the bat, the fly, the mouse, and theraccoon dog, allowing the bug of different creatures.
In fact, only 6 pieces of amino acid that were noted to be different from human infection and a chivet in RBD is 4 of them found in a motif sticking to a shared to deal with the ACE2 server.
The SARS-Cov-civet has a K479N and S487T change to its RBD, which may increase the level of the contact of the Spike protein protein and the ACE2 share.
In other words, this change of two amino acids may be essential to human transmission.
It is noteworthy that the SARS-COV-2 has the same share of the SARS-CV.
A 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CV in the S1 unit of Sport says that the level of contact for S and ACE2 people may have changed.
In fact, the study of cylo-EM shows a high degree of 10- to 20-of-this angle of this angle between ACE2 people and SS-CV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another coreceptor is needed in the SARS-COV-2 addition.
Interestingly, HCV-NL63 is again attached to ACE2 but with a different section of S.
There are other HCV services, such as amenopeptidase N at HCOV-2229E, and 9-O-actylad calcium acid acid for HCV-OC43.
They may also be regarded as a reason for the successful covation of the population after a combination of different creatures from their animal breeders.
In addition to cellular components, the result of a combination of different forms of HCVs is also controlled by dependence on another element and its limit factors.
The differences between these filaments between humans and vaccinaries who are the natural source of HCVs as bats, hydromedary camels, and rats may cause the bond between different creatures.
HCVs should take the characteristics of the client and interfere with the risk factors of the tide in order to have a successful interaction of species.
In this regard, cell mates in this vital area will be observed and identified.
SARS-CV-2 by using CRISR's modern technology may be beneficial.
New HCV appearance: return
The diversity of bat bat provides a wide range of opportunities for new HCVs.
In this sense, batcos serve as a group of HCV genes.
In addition, rapid changes and genetic engineering continue the development of HCV and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the discovery or loss of genes that make up a new protein code has the power to alter most of the bacteria.
Among the most useful proteins in SARS-CV, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adapting, since the virus related to SARS-CV is separated but found producing different RF8 proteins.
An element of 29-nucleotides of SARS-CVs has been found in different types at the beginning of a human epidemic.
This removal separates the ORF8 into the ORF8a and the ORF8b and is thought to be a self-consolving transformation that encourages the changing of the characters.
Besides, the SARS-CV may have a history of re-uniting with the blood- and gamma-Comma lists, where a large number of sub-division facilities in the RNA polymerase depend on the RNA.
Reuniting areas were found again in ansp9, in a large portion of ans10, and in parts of ans14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-COV epidemic experienced reuniting events between different ranges, which occur in Saudi Arabia cameras.
Apart from SARS-CV and MERS-CV, recombinant events have been marked by other HCVs, where HCVs are reunited with other animal CVs in their nonstructures.
It should also be noted that the selection may contribute to undetectable changes in virusgens, which may result in freeing the bacteria from the pressures of the choice used, such as those of nuclear immune systems.
An example of these results is the loss of RF4 with full length of HCV-229E, due to the removal of a double nucleotide.
Although complete RF4 was identified in the flag and camel associated with HCV-229E, analca al-CV show the insert of a single nucleotide, which leads to a change of frame.
Finally, but importantly, new HCOV conversions have been resuscitated by pressure to be selected from its source.
There were no signals or signs found only when the bats were joined with the CVs, which indicate a similar link between the CVs and the bats.
It seems that bats are well fitted with Covs according to building and operational methods.
For example, a disorder of the use of reaction that promotes inflammation of bats easily reduces the pathology introduced by COVs.
Besides, the function of the natural killer cell to bats is stressful because of the rise in response to the reactions of the block of the natural killer cell NKG2/CD94 and the lower level of simultacular I class I.
In addition, the higher levels of oxygen (ROS) that are built up by the high - quality processing of bats may affect both the stress of CV and the testing of errors with xorinonicase, thus providing the pressure for the selecting of the most microbial species when introduced to a new plant.
Mostly polyethogenic types may also be altered by recombination, leading to new protein discovery or protein characteristics of the tier.
As a result, it is not just a coincidence that three new HCVs appeared two decades ago.
CVs do not become ill or cause little symptoms to their main swimmers like bats and camels.
They multiply rapidly without promoting strong reactions to the immune system.
Here are secrets as to why nonsigned carriers are seen and what causes serious health problems in people.
Important symptoms are mainly caused by excessive immune activity and a cytokine storm where there is strong immune response, lung damage is more severe.
In contrast, for those who do not show signs of illness, the immune response has been twofoldly divided in the frequency of CV.
The same strategy for distinguishing the reactions of the immune system may have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong on the bats.
As a result, the use of I-interferon I type in at least the first stages of the SARS-CV-2 in humans should be beneficial.
Furthermore, the use of NLP3 inflammasome for bats is not valid.
According to this estimate, NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CV-2 follows the general routine of SARS-CV and MERS-CV.
Although the bat-CoV shared by 95% of nucleotide homology and SARS-CV, there is also a CV virus shared by 96% of nucleotide hormones and SARS-COV-2.
Although chivets and other market animals have been found to harbor viruses such as SARS-COV, the nearby middle-east SARS-CV-2 have not yet been found.
Beta-Congolins have been found with the same structure as SARS-COV-2, indicating that the pangolins may be some middle-and-Beta-Congolins who may be contributing to the genetic components in the SARS-COV-2 version.
Though the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 is created by man purpose or error.
The CVs are returned to the theater because of the later outbreak of SARS-CV-2.
A study of CVs on bats and other animals has profoundly changed our view of the importance of zoonotic origins and HCV sources in human interactions.
The widespread evidence indicates that SARS-CV, MERS-COV and SARS-CV-2 has a sub-out source and is passed to people by middle-wise entertainers.
Since the joining of SARS-CV comes from contact between people and markets, closing the living market and killing the Cives could end the SARS epidemic.
In the same sense, the pangolins should be removed from the biological markets to prevent the interference of the ozone flow, considering the discovery of a number of beta-COV units in pangolin closely related to SARS-COV-2.
However, whether it is transmitted and how it is passed on to humans by pangolin and other mammals will yet be explained at future funerals.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been available for extended periods of time on the logmedory camel.
These camels are an important means of transport as well as a main source of meat, honey, skin, and wool for the local people.
Not widely spread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible for all camels to be killed to control the MERS, as happens in Chinese wildlife markets to prevent the spreading of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
To prevent the repeated MERS outbreaks, a broad approach should be used to create effective goals against the camel MERS-CV, along with other measures to control the disease.
Since we cannot eliminate the bacteria, new genotypes may develop to cause outbreaks.
Various types of COV anonotics rotate in the wilderness.
In particular, the strong avocacy bats differ greatly.
There are many opportunities for these connostaltics to change and reunite, which will result in new contagion and/or deaths in the future.
The custom of eating wildlife in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a better schedule of preparation and response.
In fact, most microbes have a long life span on earth.
They stay in their natural habitat until they have the opportunity to leave.
Although bats have many characteristics that encourage the spread of bacteria, the likelihood of people contacting bats and other wild animals can be reduced if people are taught that they are far away from them.
Continued care of mammals is needed in order to better understand CV's ecology and its natural predators, which will be useful in preventing the flow from animals to humans and the future outbreaks.
At the conclusion, the best way to prevent a viral ozone layer is to keep people away from the natural environment of the biological bases of the ozone layer.
A few parts of the puzzle source of SARS-CV-2 are not yet found.
First of all, if the bats pass the SARS-CV-2-pagolins, it will be helpful to see which conditions the bats and pangolins are capable of sharing the environment.
Second, if bats play a key role in human interaction, it should be discovered how people communicate with bats.
Third, if a mammal acts as a real medium, the way we deal with a variety of people, bats, and pangolins should be made clear.
Finally, since most mammals and pets may be exposed to SARS-COV-2, both attention and concentration should be done.
If there may be a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CV-2 or its parent bacteria will be found in the future.
Further research in this area will explain the nature of the SARS-COV-2 animal revolutions, with significant effects on the prevention and management of COVID-19.
A review of the assessment of those who are "reprovable" and "provable" that they are under COVID-19 required
On 6 February 2020, our team had published the quick advice of the 20th - century coronavirus replacement therapy (2019-nCV), and the program provided our experience as well as an appropriate license to fight this worldwide epidemic.
However, the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) new disease, awareness and understanding are increasing on the basis of continued research and medical experience; hence, experiments and treatment continue to be routine.
In this book, we answered one comment about our cross and gave the subject of a new diagnosis of those who are "recognized" and "verified" that they are ill in accordance with Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seven edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new colonavirus (2019-nCV) had created explosions, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is called sere acute respiency syndrome cryonic 2 (SARS-CV-2).
In 11 March 2020, WHO referred to COVID-19 as a epidemic.
For the exception of the SARS-COV-2, our team has established the speed of quick response and is printed on the Internet on the Military Medical Research in February 2020.
He has received much attention since it was published.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, awareness and knowledge of it is increasing on the basis of studies and medical experience; hence, the techniques of testing and treatment continue to be revised.
For example, Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19, published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.www.nc.c.c.n/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have produced seven volumes in which other things have been dramatically changed.
Our document received notice from Zhou et al., providing a simple suggestion of points based on their experience.
Their work adds new proof of our epidemic and makes a significant reference to this epidemic throughout the world.
We commend their vital work and offer our thanks.
However, their DO needs to be rewarded in accordance with the recent Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (The seventh research program) and later studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to ensure the diagnosis, it is necessary to clear out any one of the aspects of epidemological history and two exhibits for general reviews, or to meet three aspects of the medical treatment without a clear history of epidemological:
The history of epidemiological: (1) the history of visiting or staying in the town of Wuhan and the environment, or other communities where COVID - 19 is reported in the past 14 days before the beginning of symptoms; (2) the history of contact with people connected with SARS-CV-2 (by the study of nucleic acid acid); (3) the history of contact with patients or breathing symptoms in Wuhan and the environment, or other communities where CVID-19 are reported in the 14 days before the beginning of symptoms; (4) the history of contact with many patients who are convinced by the presence of the number of four sick, as well as well as well as local, have been found in the hospital, and home.
Symptoms of treatment: (1) fever along with/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) symptoms of the picture of a cryptography of COVID-19; (3) total number of white blood cells that indicate a normal, low, or reduced level of lymphocyte.
A diagnosis of a confirmed illness should be based on the one suspected case of the following evidence for Pathgenic or verification: (1) a brief examination of the SARS-CV-2 period of the SAR-2; (2) a sequence of a full dose of the virus that displays a super-detectable hormone in the new cronavirus; (3) the presence of a direct IgM and the IgG for SAR-CV-2's test; or the complete development of the IRCR-CR-CR-CR-2 of the virus, which is the most effective treatment of the case.
We see that a real PCR testing of nucleic acid in the respiratory or blood samples is caused in two systems (18 January 2020) and 3 (2 January 2020).
Pathogenic findings in the blood sample are made in the four primary components (27 January 2020) and 5 (8 February 2020); and the evidence for the steroids is included in the seventh order.
These changes based on the continued work of researchers on the search for high nucleic acids for rapid tests, as well as on respiratory samples that include a synapses of blood, which increased the availability of different tissue, and contributed to the overall effect of the immune system on the established matter.
Besides, there is additional evidence that reminds us that we are on guard against patients with unusual symptoms and those who have no symptoms.
Thus, the Zhou et al flow chart should be replaced, as it refers to a person who has no symptoms of treatment as "as a low risk."
The point process also needs to be reassured at work and in progressive medical studies.
In conclusion, we hope for further evidence to come and ask that the disciples observe it.
In order to make a diagnosis of "reprofessed illness" and "verified illness", recommend that it be followed and attended by new national channels in their home.
Our helmet will also turn our backs on our backs so as to provide help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths caused by COVID-19, the highest number of day.
Last day, Bangladesh confirmed a new fifth death due to COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of days caused by the virus.
Since yesterday, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, the Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) has reported that the number of sick people is 114 as well as the 33 innocent who live at home.
A total of 17 deaths is recorded.
In the main Internet news service, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerdy Sabrina Flora, said that the dead include four men as well as one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were over 60, two between 51 and 60, and one was between 41-50.
He also said that two of them were coming from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announces that COVID-19 is a pestilence on March 11.
The hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news source, that one of the dead was Jaal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an Internet video announcement, Badaidul Quader of the public transport minister in Bangladesh said that the public transport will be stopped for a longer time than was scheduled, until the next Saturday.

Australia’s stores reduce the price of a small house paper at each purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian store chain Wolworths and Coles reduces its purchase of public paper so that one can buy two and one pack from each store in the entire country, respectively.
ALDI also introduces a minimum of one pack, Monday.
These levels are recorded as messages on exit, and on the Facebook pages of this store.
The buyers have continued to buy their bulk because of fear of COVID-19 if they have to separate themselves.
On Wednesday, Wolworths reconquest to buy the toilet paper from those who are brought home to be a single pepper for each order.
These changes follow the fore-and-aft of four-deckers on each purchase that was introduced by the Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"U-Coles, in its March 8, news conference reported that at a minimum of four pears set up, "" most stores still lose goods about the hour of their arrival"", and called the need "explicably"", whereas ALDI, in its Facebook package on Tuesday, "and "unexpected"."
"Bast sell" very high" last week, according to the President Woolworths.
Costco stores in Canberra also multiply the number allowed to be two peels a week ago.
In order to deal with the search, Coles ordered the largest packages for the surgeons and announced the increase in the distribution, Woolworths ordered an additional toy, while ALDI made a set-up parcels of Wednesday to be readily available.
Russell Zimmerman, the senior director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that the merchants try to raise the tow, but the results of the local council regarding the time of the carriage of trucks make things difficult.
He expects the cost of production to rise, as surgeons try to meet the need, with a few polishers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that as a result of the immediate release of a vaccine, some stores are unable to continue with the Wednesday detective.
In a report in News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortitimer, a Queensland University of Technology expert, says that stores fill a store every night.
The Mark noted that a small house paper is a heavy item, leading to a low number of loopholes in numbers, and, once completed, leaving a large opening open, which reinforces the feeling that it is worshiped.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion [that] if there were many items in the shelves, if a product such as small homemade paper and tractors might be [sold] and there is a lot, you could probably reduce fear as well as the Russell Zimmerman says the ABC News.
The inventor of the recombined public paper Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday and then lost out.

Russell Zimmerman adds that some products also have a high need, including macadamiatos, dried foods, cooking soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday night the supermarket sold on the British Internet Ocado was seen to replace the purchase of Andres paper for two of a 12 trucks.
The World Health Organization has referred to COVID-19 to the epidemic
On the third day, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 — coronavirus SARS-CV-2 — epidemic.
"May the word "" refers to the extent of the disease we are affected, not to the extent in which specific examples are harmful, WHO has demonstrated the need to run governments in action:"
All countries are no longer able to reverse this pandemic process.
If countries investigate, investigate, are here, divide, follow, and respond by controlling human functions, says Tedros ADamo Ghebreyes, director of WHO.
We are deeply concerned about both the frightening and difficult distributions and the lack of movement in shock levels.
"According to Dr. Tom Frieden, who was the previous director of the United States's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is "and no previous comparison."
"He said, according to the notice declared to the CNN in February, "Beside the flu, there is no other respiratory virus followed from it until it is spreading around the world."
"Grebreyus has given the same vision, "We have never seen before the plague removed by the coronavirus."
"We've continued," and we've never seen a plague that can be controlled at the same time."
The new condition of the plague follows the decision of WHO's January's decision to call the outbreak as a global crisis of the emergency state of public health.
"The director of the United States' National Institute of Autogy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said, "What remains, is going to be worse."
Since Thursday, the Associated Press reports that there are at least 126,000 examples of COVID-19 worldwide, leading above 4.600 dead.
The 20th plague of 20–20 coronavirus is the ongoing outbreak of colonvirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the sere acute respiency syndrome cryonicus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was carried out in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it was declared the Public Health Emergency on 30 January 2020, and it was viewed as a epidemic on 11 March 2020.
Since 10 April 2020, the 1.61 million accurate examples of COVID-19 have been reported in the countries with 4210 boundaries, leading to 97,000 deaths.
Some 36,000 persons have recovered.
The number of examples of destruction has been estimated at 4% in China, at the same time the globe range from 13.04% in Algeria to 1.8% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include heat, sweat, and cold.
Problems may include pneumonia and aute respiratory stress syndrome.
The period of exposure to symptoms usually lasts for five days, but it can range from two to fourteen.
No known cure or treatment can defeat the virus.
The primary method of treatment is to monitor signs and warnings, which include handwashing, closing your mouth while coughing, keeping a distance between you and others, and keeping your distance from people who suspect that they may be infected.
The authorities around the world are now responding to restrictions on travel, separation, movement, safety measures on the workplace, and land control.
The plague has led to severe economic and social upheavals worldwide, to slow down or give up sports, religion, politics, and cultural events, as well as to the lack of basic necessities that are quickly eliminated.
Schools including universities are closed in the country or 193 countries, which affect 99.4 percent of the world’s students correctly.
Wrong information about the virus has become widely spread on the Internet, and there have also been cases of racial prejudice and discrimination against Chinese people, other people from the East and the descendants of the Far East, and the appearance of North Asian countries, and others from the world with many examples of the virus.
As a result of reduced means of travel and the closing of large industries, there has been a decrease in pollution of air and carbon dioxide.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (Hubei district capital) reported a series of non-invacuous examples of pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and a survey was opened in early January 2020.
Many examples have been related to the Huanaon Seaod Whole Market, and the virus is caused by the origin of the biological origin of the animal.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-COV-2, a virus that starts to develop that is closely related to batoviruses, cronanaviruses, pangolins, and SARS-CV. The first known person who showed symptoms was later found to be ill in December 2019, and that the person never had a clear relationship with the seat network.
In the first series of examples reported on December 2019, three parts were found connected to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unprovable report from the South China Morning Post raised that the following example from 17 November 2019, of a 5th - year - old person of the province of Hubei, may be the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new examples are reported falling in China but they are growing by accident in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, a number of new examples outside China and have passed the number of new Chinese examples for the first time.
There may be reports under examples, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, small examples had been cited among young people, those who had sinned 19-19 and undertook 2.4% of the world's examples. The chief science counselor of the United Kingdom's, Patrick Ballance, appealed to me 60% of the British community that would need to fit in so that the Effective maleity would be achieved.
Examples refer to the number of persons tested for COVID-19, and their tests confirm the validity of the procedure.
Since March 23, no country has investigated more than 3% of its population, and many countries have passed laws against those who have only dark symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A survey published on 16 March found that in China, until January 23, the figure is 86% of a link with COVID-19, and this unwritten link is the 79% source of recorded cases of disease.
A mathematical analysis published by March 30 estimated that the number of joinings in Italy is much higher than reported examples.
The first estimate of the simple birthrate ($00) of COVID-19 of 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that it may be 5.7.
Most cases with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not recover, the period from the form of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, most commonly 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, at least 97,000 deaths were set as a reason for COVID-19.
In China, since 5 February about 80% of the dead were more than 60, and 75% are already present with health problems including heart disease and diabetes. Official death rates of COVID - 19 normally refer to people who are tested for COVID on the law.
The true number of the dead may be very large, since it does not include everyone who dies without a test -ib. at home, at the adults's home, etc.
A data from Italy found that the number of deaths during the plague exceeded the official death rates due to COVID by 4-5x.
"A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know" that the [death-based number] is below the average"", a statement corresponding to the U.S. study reports of acdotal census under the U.S.. A similar estimate is common if there is a epidemic, such as the H1N1-four flu epidemic in 2009. The first death reported in Wuhan by January 2020".
The first deaths occurring outside the Chinese country itself occurred in February of the Philippines, and the first deaths outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On 28 February, apart from the Chinese country itself, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March, more than 40 countries and areas had reported death, on all continents other than Antarctica. There are several measures often used to calculate the mortality rate.
These numbers vary from place to place, and are influenced by the extent of testing, the quality of health care, treatment methods, time from the beginning of outbreak, and social factors such as age, sex, and general health. The dath-to-case ratio shows the number of the dead are divided by the number of examples checked during a certain period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the Global Death-to-caserate is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) since 10 April 2020.
The number varies from place to place.
In China, the estimate of deth-to-case abandono fell from 17.3% (for those whose symptoms appeared November 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who had symptoms appearing in February 2020). Other measures include casesity negativeity rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people who die of disease, and infR (IFR) who show a percentage of infected (exported and undiagnosed) death.
These figures do not depend on time and follow the number of individuals from the link in the illustration’s solution.
Many highly educated people tried to calculate the numbers of certain people.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidance-Based Medicine estimates that infestation factor rate for the general epidemic is between 0.1% and 0.5%.
A higher estimate of this rate is in line with the results from an informal study of COVID-19 Germany, and a study of statistics that evaluate the results of CFR surveys.
WHO asserts that the epidemic can be controlled.
The real height and height of the eruption are uncertain and can vary from place to place.
"Maciej Boni of Penn State University said," "If left unobserved, interconnected outbreaks are reduced from creation and begin to decline when the disease is lost by the survivors."
"But it is almost impossible to make a guess now about when that will be."
"The great medical adviser Zhong Nanshan of the Chinese government said "May be finished by June" if all countries are able to follow the action of WHO to prevent the spread of infection."
"In 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygie & Tropical Medicine spoke and said SARS-CV-2 "will go around, strongly for one or two years."
"According to the study of Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other steps will be required "until the solution is obtained (by bathing 18 months or more)."
"Wiliam Schaffer of Vanderbilt University said, "I think" it is unlikely that this coronavirus will be easy to pass away forever" may also "become a year's disease, return every year."
Return rage will depend on strong protection of the flock and the degree of self - change
Signs of COVID-19 may be sidelined and people connected may have no symptoms.
The most common symptoms are heat (8%) and dryer (68%).
The most common symptoms include fatigue, constips and fibrosis (flegm), shortness of breath, shortness of breath, muscle and joints, sore throats, headaches, colds, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanis. WHO has said that 1 person in 6 is seriously ill and has a respiratory problem.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list showing symptoms such as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or depression, nausea, difficulties when awakening, and cancer face or lips; early medical care is recommended if these symptoms exist. The advanced medical care in this regard may lead to severe pneumonia, absstride, spsic shock, and death.
Some of those affected may have no symptoms, no symptoms, but their research results prove fatal, so researchers have suggested that those who have had close contact with those who have been convinced must be hired closer and immersed to ensure the absence of the disease.
China's comparison to those who did not have the signal may range from a few to 44%.
A typical warm period (the period between addition and onset of symptoms) has a distance from one to 14 days; usually five days; to make an example of uncertainty, to measure half of those with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and later down to 15%.
Other details of the spread of disease are now discussed.
The disease is believed to be spread primarily during close contact and small bits formed when you cough, sneeze, or speak; when the close contact is about 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 yards).
Research has found that unburied coughs can lead to a distance of up to 15 feet [4.5 m] (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 mtres).
Some have raised the possibility that the virus may be transmitted by small, slow - moving droplets in the air, which can be present during speech. Synapses may also form during breathing, including when speaking, even though the virus does not usually travel through the air.
Teaches can sit in the mouths or noses of people nearby or may be picked up into the lungs.
Other medical procedures, such as intubion and cariopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause respiratory infections to cool off and result in air pollution.
It may also be lost when someone touches a infected area, which includes the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Even if there is concern that it may be on the increase, the danger believes that it is low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of the transmission of SARS-CV-2 infection by oral contact after contact with the sewage. The virus is more likely to have a close contact during the first three days when symptoms may occur even before symptoms appear and the final stages of the disease.
People were diagnosed with the virus up to three days before symptoms could develop that indicate that transmission could occur before major symptoms developed.
Only a few reports of unprovable examples have been verified, but unmarked transmission has been conducted by other countries during a follow - up survey.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that although it is not clear how easily the disease is spread, one person often infects another two or three others. The virus continues to live for hours to more than things.
Pointedly, the virus is found to reach three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 in stainles stateel, one day on cards, until four hours in copper.
This, however, varies from temperature and temperature to temperature. Home animals and other animals who have believed have actually been found with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, even though British nanotechnology commands a person to wash his hands after touching animals, as after touching infected areas that people may have touched.
The Seare respiratory system coronavirus 2 (SARS-CV-2) is a new virus, which began to be separated from three people who had pneumonia combined with a series of symptoms of respiratory infections in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the new SARS-CV-2 virus occur in a natural environment of coronaviruss. Without the human body, the virus dies with home keys, as it melts its external defenses. I SARS-COV-2 is related closely to SARS-COV-COV.
The result is the origin of the fusion from an animal.
Genetic research has revealed that coronavirus naturally joins with the Betacoronvirus type, subdivision species of Sarbecovirus (line B) and small pieces from bats.
It is the same as 96% of the total number of samples of other bats. (Batcov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is a single concentration of amino acids that differs from certain chemical elements between bacteria from pangolins and those of humans.
All chemical comparisons to this day have found that it may be 92% of the original elements between the pangolinus cogolinus and SARS-CV-2, which are not enough to prove that the pangolins are central stores.
The transmission of the virus may be obtained by seeing the symptoms, though final confirmation comes by changing the scanner Polymerase hin (rRT-PCR) of the crash or with a CT image.
A study that compares PCR to the Wuhan CT has raised that CT is far more sympathetic than PCR, even though its appearance is lower, since many of its group pictures of other hormones and diseases.
"From March 2020, the American College of Radioology has raised the "" CT should not be used for investigation or if it is the first screening process of COVID-19".
WHO has published countless RNA checks for SARS-CV-2, the first one published in January 17.
Tests are used by re-time reverse pass by polymerase special action (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be made with respiratory or blood samples.
The results often occur within a few hours of the day.
This test is usually done with a swab of nasopharyngeal although the throat swabber can also be used. The number of moths and companies promote natural dyeing, which is able to obtain antibodies.
Since April 6, 2020, none of these have developed as well as adequate to be entitled to use everywhere.
In the US an automation test conducted by Celllex is licensed to be used with emergency conditions only with certificates.
Image properties for radiographs and computers tomography (CT) for people who show signs include Asymmetric peripheral great granaries and absal points.
The Italian radic Society combines the worldwide online database to be found with authenticated models.
Because of other diseases such as adenovirus, the taking of pictures without making sure of the PCR has a reasonable degree of reference to COVID-19.
A great study in China compared the effects of CT and PCR’s chest and showed that although the image has a small degree in clarifying, it is faster and more sympathetic, which raises the view as a test tool in the pidemiic areas of the epidemic.
Accelerational network based on non-interactive intellince is developed so that they can check the properties of the bacterial images with both radiographs and CT.
Tactics against transmitting the virus include strict personal hygiene, handwashing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with soiled hands, and coughing or coughing with a towel and putting the towel directly into the toilet.
Those who may have found themselves in a crowd are encouraged to wear a face mask.
The steps that have been taken to protect one another’s physical well - being are also encouraged by the efforts of many governments to restrict or ban one another.
Yet, the virus has reached the point where widespread population is affected in parts of the world.
This means that the virus is still spreading in communities, and some public members do not know where it comes from or how it is infected. Health health workers who care for someone who may be affected are encouraged to use a set method of caution, alertness of contact, and protection of the eyes. Follow the affected course of the health authorities see the source of joint interaction and prevent further transmission.
Using a piece of land from the nose from the state for this purpose has eliminated concern about privacy, the Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations produce a statement that limits this view.
There are already different mailboxes that are installed or held for voluntary use, and since April 7, 2020, more than 12 teams of experts have been working on technical and confidential solutions, such as using Bluetooth to install a log for the user's close contact with other mobile phones.
Users can now receive a message when it happens to be close to someone who was diagnosed with COVID-19. There are roundly conflicting views of safety methods; for example, the cleaning of the nose and the mouthash is not effective.
There is no problem for COVID-19, even though many organizations are working to build it.
Hand washing is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially when you walk out of the bathroom or the waist appear dirty; before eating; and after coughing, coughing, or sneezes.
The reason for this is that outside the human body, the virus is killed by the home soap, for it burns its defense rifle.
The CDC also encouraged the use of alcohol-based utils and at least 60% of alcohol with volume if soap and water are not available at the time.
WHO encourages people to avoid touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unclean hands.
The areas can be contaminated with a few resolutions (between one minute of exposure to bacteria rather than steroids), including 62–71% of ethanol, 50–100% of soopanool, 0.1% of sodium hypochlorate, 0.5% of hydrogen peroxide, and 02.5% of  utterlyodone-iodine.
Some solutions, such as basalconium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, work at a lower rate.
The CDC recommends that if the COVID model is blamed or confirmed in such places as office or day care, all places, such as offices, latrines, public places, equipment used by all, such as libraries, lockers, boards, remote controls, and ATM devices used by patients, it must be killed.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a cough or a cough when coughing, or sneezing, and then quickly throw out any cough.
The surgical masks are passed on to those who may be connected, since wearing a mask puts a limit on the amount and the amount of breathing gums go out when you speak, pause, and cough.
The WHO has issued instructions on time and method of using the Mask.
"As told by Stephen Griffin, a brainlogist at the University of Leeds, "Masking may reduce the tendency of people to touch the face, which is the greatest source of infection without proper handwashing. "" Masks are also encouraged to be used by those caring for someone who may be ill."
WHO has recommended that nonpatient people wear masks only if they are in high risk, such as those who care for a COVID-19 person, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people to avoid contact with their face.
Many countries have begun to promote the idea that members of the community must use visible masks.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing a cloth mask rather than a medical one. China has directly recommended that non-patient members use discarded health checks, especially when you are close to one another at least three feet [3 m] or below the other people.
Hong Kong encourages wearing a surgical mask when taking public transportation or sitting in full areas.
Health workers in Thailand are encouraging people to make laundry at home and clean all day long.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia officially closed their entrance to the community without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
In March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask when he went to public places to protect himself and others.
The Austrian government insisted that everyone entering the restaurant should wear a face mask.
Israel asked all citizens to wear a ruler mask when they were in the community.
Taiwan, as it has continued to produce ten million masks a day from the middle of March, asking train passengers and city buses to wear their visible masks in 1 April.
Panama has made it difficult to wear the face mask whenever you go out, at the same time encouraging to build up a face mask at home for those who cannot afford your face masks.
Its most widely used masks in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Isolation (also known as physical isolation) includes steps to control the link intended to suppress the spread of the disease by reducing close contact with people.
Roads include divisions; travel barriers; and closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, tractors, and shopping centers.
Individuals may be able to use isolation by living at home, taking on a visit, avoiding crowded places, greeting without contact, and physically separating themselves from others.
Many governments are now forcing or promoting social Disstancing in those areas affected by the plague.
A high number of unions raised by the US government and health agencies were suddenly reduced to 250 (if there was no increase in COVID-19), it was put in 50 penicillin, and later reached 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany officially closed a public gathering of more than two persons. The elderly and those with present health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, asthma, and immune immune agents are faced with the risk of serious illness and problems and the CDC warned them to stay in the homes as much as possible in the morning 2020. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began using the term ‘ physical isolation' instead of that is a social isolation', so that it would be apparent that the desire to reduce the same sex at the same time is kept in contact with them, in the same way.
"Social isolation" has led to the conclusion that people should have a full share in social isolation, it can encourage them to continue contacting others in different ways. Some authorities have produced guidelines for sexual health that can be used in the still ongoing plague.
These include sexual urges only those who live with a roommate, who does not have a virus or a virus.
The separation to be home is encouraged by those who have received a COVID-19 and those who suspect that they may be infected.
Many governments have banned or even suppressed public health - care systems by promoting unfair housing regulations.
The most heavy guidelines for closing home are passed on to those in the most endangered groups.
Those who are likely to be exposed to someone with a COVID-19 and those who have recently visited the country or a widely distributed district have been encouraged to close 14 days since the time of the final exposure.
Tactics to control the epidemic are closing or suppressing, and reducing.
Coverage is followed in the first phases of the plague and is intended to search out and separate those who are involved and that other joint - control programs and remedies are opened to prevent the disease from sleeping again and to other people.
If it is not possible to prevent the spread of disease, efforts are being made to reduce it: steps are taken to reduce its spread and reduce its effects in health care and society.
Blowing both steps of closing and cutting may be followed at the same time.
Stress requires extreme measures to reduce the epidemic by reducing the birthrate to less than 1. Part of the care for the outbreak of infectious disease is to try to reduce the plague’s peak, known as slowing down the line of plague.
This reduces the risk that health services are found to be frustrating and allows more time for drugs and remedies to be developed.
An individual medical intervention that can control development includes personal protective measures, such as hand - washing, masking, physical steps towardses, such as closing schools and highlighting public events; participation in encouraging the public to accept and to participate in such interventions; and so natural measures as cleaning up areas. Strong measures were taken in China when the size of the eruption is clear, such as closing cities completely, and breaking the laws against tourism.
Other countries have also come up with various measures intended to limit the spread of infection.
South Korea introduced public attention and made room arrests, and it gave warnings about the movement of those who joined in.
Singapore has been struck by financial support for those who have entered and imposed high pay on those who have not been able to do it regularly.
Taiwan has raised the output of its own masks and has put the sentence on the medical facilities. Great Britain and the United States's modeling shows that reductions (but not halting the expansion of the epidemic) and pressure (to slow up the growth of the epidemic) are a major challenge.
The main reduction laws may reduce the serious need for health care by 2/3 and a half, however, the end is the death of hundreds of thousands and the frustration of health programs.
Pressure may be better but it needs to be kept as long as the virus continues to surround human society (or until the solution is found, if that occurs first), as transmission rises rapidly when steps are released.
Prolonged exposure to the scourge creates social and economic costs.
No drugs are directly authorized to combat COVID-19, but efforts to build them are still on the way, including testing existing drugs.
Taking medication from stores, drinking liquids, and resting may help ease the symptoms.
Depending on the weight, the treatment of the air, the liquid taken, and the support of breathing may be necessary.
The use of steroids may minimize the results.
Many elements that have been authorized for the operation of other growing diseases are being investigated for use in treating COVID-19.
"WHO also issued that some "old and home solutions" may be able to perform relief from these symptoms of SARS-COV-19."
To increase the strength and balance of health care according to the need for COVID-19 patients is raised by WHO as a serious emergency response to outbreaks.
The ECDC and the European Regional Revocial of WHO have issued medical procedures and health cares that have often been removed by various classes, which include focusing the work of moths in the study of COVID-19, highlighting selected procedures where possible, disassociating and dividing established COVID-19 patients, and increasing the quality of care by operating personnel and increasing the number of breathing and beds.
Opinions vary as to where the first example (called ovarian) originated.
The first known example of a new connavirus goes back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.

The Iran president Hassan Rouhani writes to national leaders a letter asking for help on 14 March 2020, his country thrusts a hard fight against the deep - rooted world market based on the United States’s values against Iran. This promotion has led to recommendations that the United States has made that the United States has adopted social goals that are considered as well as other rich nations, the need for general health, the care of children, the cost of the family’s rent family and the higher medical level.
Political analysts hope that it might affect Donald Trump’s chances of succeeding again in the 2020 ’ s to the election of president of Japan and South Korea.
"South Korea" is critical of Japan "for criminal efforts" after Japan declared that everyone from South Korea will be held in custody for two weeks in special institutions."
In the beginning, the South Korean community was quite divided by ideas about the reaction of President Maon Jae-in in this tragedy.

The outbreak of coronavirus is blamed for a lack of materials as a result of the increased use of machines is also due to the eruptions, impulse buying, and long - term problems of production and transport.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings against the shortage of legal drugs and medical equipment because of a rise in the demand for buyers and a breakdown in the market.
A few sections have seen the sudden purchase of materials leading to the rapid loss of basic goods, such as food, toleetce, and commercial water, resulting in a shortage of basic necessities
The technology industry has been warning of the delay of transport of electrical goods.
According to WHO Secretary of Defense Tedros Adamon, the need for personal protection has increased to 100 times the number.
This demand has led to an increase in numbers to a mere 20 times the average cost of shopping and has been created to delay medical facilities in four to six months
It also created a worldwide lack of personal security equipment to warn Who that this endangers the health benefits of medical personnel.
Australia, the plague created a new opportunity for the daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China
The reality of this has created a shortage of bottle food for children in some large stores by the Australian government has now closed it. Despite the high degree of the Ovid-19 disease in North and Italy and the Wuhan region and the greater demand for the next meal, both areas have had no major food shortage.
China and Italy’s initiatives against the collection and trafficking of most important goods have been successful and prevented from food shortages that were expected in Europe and North America
Northern Italy with its abundance of agriculture has not seen a major decline, but according to those representing the industry, prices may rise.
The absence of food in restaurants was temporary even in the city of Wuhan, and in China, government officials let the food of the pigs collected to ensure the livelihood of the population.
Similar laws are available in Italy that require those who undergo emergency surgery.
The damage to the world’s economy is reported in China, according to news reports on 16 March 2020, China’s economy was seriously damaged in the first two 2020 months because of measures taken by the government to stop the spread of the virus, which are sold in stores in 20.5%

This short - term German work schedule has also been adopted by France and Britain.
Pharmacy firms and culture are remarkably sensitive by the plague that disrupted the operation of organizations and institutions and international representatives
Artisans and culture have tried to perpetuate their programs, generally supported by government, open - air markets, and keep their employees and communities safe, as well as to support the public.
Then, in March 2020, worldwide and at varying degrees, museums, theaters, and cultural centers were closed at random, arrows and games were cut or postponed.

An examination of repiratory coronavirus as 2019 Covid-19 and the SARS-COV-2-virus concerning it combines the means of detecting the presence of a virus and those who see antibodies as a result if one is infected.
The presence ofviruses in bytes is verified by RT-PCR that detects the presence of cronanavirus
This study is specially designed to evaluate the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
It is used to ensure a recent or current diagnosis of disease.
An antibodies,ology, can be used either for a person's diagnosis or for a social service.
Antibody studies show how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated or without any symptoms at all.
The exact number of deaths from this disease and the extent of the inequities of the public can be traced to the outcome of this test.
As a result of the estimates, by March 2020, no countries had any reliable estimates about the number of active growth in their society.
By March 23 no country had studied more than 3 of the people in their countries, and there is a significant difference in the number of surveys that have been conducted in various countries.
These differences may have a profound impact on reported death rates that may have occurred in some countries.
According to the use of re-time transfer polymerase special action, rrt-PCR, this check can be made in a variety of types of respirations, including nasophargary music or sputum.
The results are usually found between two hours and 2 days.
A RT-PCR test made by a swabber can be reliable only in the early church of the cases.
In the future, the virus may disappear from the throat but will continue to increase in the lungs.
For infected persons tested in the second week, some of the steel satellites can be removed from the bottom of the spraying channels or by coughing the mattressal, sputum, which can be used.
Some of the first PCR methods were developed in the Crimes in Berlin in January 2020 by the use of re-time transmission by means of the transocracy plymerase scan, RRT-PCR, which provides the basis for the circulation of 250,000 kitchens by the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom had also developed a method of testing on 23 January 2020. The Kogenebiot South Korean company developed the PCR-based SARSCV-2 kit for a medical examination on 28 January 2020.
"Egene" is the same in all the beta coronaviruses and RdRp form found only in SARS-CV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the companies that obtained permission of the National Products Administration to use the PCARS-based SARV-2. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDCC, distribute the 2019-Novel Corvirus, Novel-C, Novel-R, Norest-R, Rental-CCCCCCs on the research on the program.
Three genetic test tests in the old ways of quick checks produced some unclear results because of poor RandC tests in Atlanta, which resulted in less than 100 tables per day effective throughout February 2020.
The testing was not found to be reliable until 28 February 2020 and until that time when regional and local research stations were allowed to begin.
This method of testing was authorized by Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Administration. The independent survey centers began a test at the beginning of March 2020.
On March 5, 2020 The Lab Corp announced international access to the COVID-19 RT-PCR
The Quest Diagnotics, in turn, conducted a COVID-19 findings from 9 March 2020.
No mathematical limits were announced, the gathering and digesting of Specins should be done according to the CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR
On 11 February 2020 this method of testing was registered by the Federal Service for Survey in Health20. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed the type of COVID-19. In 13 March 2020, the Roche Diagnos received permission for the FDA of the type of test done within 3.5 hours, thus allowing one machine to make a 4128 study in 24 hours.
In March 2020, the FDA has issued the Abbot Laboratories permission for critical times, the EU, to check on the Abott m2,000 policy, the FDA has previously given the Hogic, the TabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific license.
On 21-March 2020, the Cepheid similarly received EUA with the FDA of a kind of testing type that takes about 45 minutes.
FDA has allowed the type of test using the sothermal nucecic substance substance substance substance abuse instead of PCR.
Because this does not require a series of temperature and heat cycles, this type can provide the outcome of the mail in a few minutes for five minutes with negatives in 13 minutes.
At present there are approximately 18,000 machinery in the U.S. and Abbott expects to raise its performance to do some 50,000 tests a day. A study using monoclon antibody especially adheres to nucleopsid protein, Nprotein, novel coronavirus is developed in Taiwan in the hope that it will not produce results in 15 to 20 minutes like influenza.
"Repetition of March 2020 concluded that "" radar graphs are less helpful in the first paragraphs and that CT, computer tomography, may exist before symptoms begin to occur."
Common features of the CT include bilateral multibar-grand-gras opaginities with peripheral, asymetricand posteritor responsible.
Subpleucal resource, crazy paring and console grow as the disease changes itself.
A survey that compares the PCR to the Wuhan at the site where this epidemic started suggests that CT is more sympathetic than PCR but does not have details, many of which are related to other pneumonia and disease processes.
"By March 2020, the American College of Radioology recommends that "CT" may be used to distinguish or test COVID-19 for first time" by March 2020, the CDC encourages PCR on death for the first time."
Part of the munnese treatment is the production of antibodies including Igm and IgG.
These can be used for testing the existence of the disease from 7 days or more, in order to identify the absence and employment of the public. Assays can be made up of major research centers, CLTs, or by point-of-caring, PCT.
A high rate of automad systems in most medical research centers will be able to work with siskeys but their availability will depend on the vine for each product.
With CRL, we are uniquely single speccimen of the peripheral blood used, even though sericial slics are not used for the reactions of the body soldiers.
By PCT, single blood specimin is usually obtained by applying skin.
In contrast with PCR methods, an operation of shooting is not necessary before work. In 26 March 2020, FDA introduced 29 terms that reported this act as necessary and now are able to distribute antibody testes.
For 7 April 2020, only one method of testing is allowed for the FDA under the permission of critical conditions. By the end of March 2020, the Euroimiium Medical Laboratory Diagnoss and Epitome Diagnos found the approval of its European satellites who can test to see the IgG and IgA anti-virus in their blood cells.
The amount of testing is a few hundred discs during the hour and is much faster than the PCR environment of the Visual RNA.
The presence of antibodies is usually checked after 14 days of infection. In April, the UK found that none of the antibody testites he bought would be effective.
"Hong Kong is a program in which patients are suspected may stay at home," "the presence of serious conditions that will give the patient a spleen tube", to open it in, back and get the results after a while. The British NHS announced that it is starting a program for home evaluation that the patient will take the risk of infecting others when the patient is on the hospital or the need to screening for the infection if there is a patient has been done. Concerning the illness at COVD-19, the health worker will take advantage of the best use."
South Korea has helped South Korea to make the most rapid, most focused studies in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statary Health Investigation Physicians spoke on 2 March, stating that there were some 12,000 studies a day on the alarm schedule and 10.700 were conducted last week.
The cost is measured by health insurance when a doctor calls.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the power to include 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19 tests of driving were given in many large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total total number of German surveys is not known, because only the correct results are reported.
"The first survey of the library showed that from the 12-20th week of the calendar the total of samples at least 483,225 were tested and included 12/2020 samples and 333.49% in the survey where she confirmed SARS-CV-2. Israel, researchers at the Technion and Ramm Hospital and studied the screening of 64 patients at the same time, by including only more samples when the sample had been shown to confirm it.
Since the building was still being built by the BGI founder Wang Jian and took 5 days, modeling indicates that the examples in Hubei would be up by 47% and the necessary cost to meet the arrest would be twice as long as the ability to include experiments had not been available in time.
The Wuhan Republic is quickly followed by the libraries of Huo-Yan in Shenzhen, Tinjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities throughout China.
From 4 March 2020 the total of daily transmissions to some 50,000 tests per day. The open source, the intricate drawings released by Origami Asssays has been opened to enable them to examine the samples of many patients until 12121 at COVID19 are used only 93. These synthetic drawings can operate on small computers without the need for boilers.
Since March, the shortage and insufficient number of reagents has become a major factor in testing the majority between the EU and the UK and the US.
This has led some writers to examine the legal methods of providing samples that involves a fever of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free more RNA elements. In March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now examining the number of their own people in their eyes for Coronavirus per head than any other country, and they have gone on a good foot to raise the level of test to reach a greater portion of the population.
"This was a combination of a combination of flow-scale-scalemas-throught laboratory on Group 42 and BGI (based on" Huo-Yan" visualisation in China).
Built in 14 days, the web is capable of directing tens of thousands of surveys by RT-PCR per day and the first in the world of this operating measure outside China.
Various techniques of insight into different types of coronavirus are built in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization chose the German construction program for the construction of fasts that were sent to poor countries without their own building services.
The German policy was published in 17 January 2020; a policy developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not achieved until 28 January, it delayed research in the U.S. and U.S. United States to deal with the security problems of autosuits early in the morning, and these countries and Australia were unable to build and produce sufficient tanks to satisfy the need and encourage health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that the wide availability of surveys in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The power to include testing, especially in independent libraries, was developed over a period of many years by the government of the South Korean.
In March 16 the World Health Organization called for the giving of test procedures as the best way to suppress COVID-19. The high need for screening for the spread of the virus resulted in a burgeoning of hundreds of thousands of U.S. libraries independent, and the removal of the sunbs and chemical reaccitation was stressful.
In March 2020 China reported problems on the accuracy of her inspection boats.
"In the United States, CDC scans are found "" with errors" the government removed the law walls that had banned private investigations. Spain bought tickets from the China Shenzhen Bioiesy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were wrong."
The company explained that the side effects may be caused by judgment on samples or by the proper use of stoves.
The Spanish Ministry said that it would produce the kitchens that produced the wrong results, and it will put in their place the Shenzhen Bioiesy. 80% of the Czech Republic inspection operations that bought them from China produced the wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million experiments in China found to be accurate.
"Prime Minister Matovič recommended that she be rejected by adding to the Danube. Ateş Cara of Turkish Health Ministry said that Turkey test boxes in China were found to have "a high level of errors" and not "used." The UK bought 3.5 million search boats in China but early April 2020 proclaimed that they were not used."
Tests, followed by arrests of those found confirming and following the individuals who had had contact with people who had shown to ensure of the SARS-CV-2 tests, the results were also verified.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the first death center of COVID-19 in Italy, directed a round of a total survey of 3,400 people, at least ten days away.
At least half of the hypertensive people surveyed had no symptoms, and all the examples found were locked up.
With the visit close by, this eliminates a completely new link.
By following the enthusiastic victims, incoming visits were detected, testing, and closing, the 2020 Coronavirus epidemic in Singapore continues to be far more effective than in other developed countries, but without severe restrictions such as the closing of food stores and other markets.
Many events were hit, and Singapore began to advise citizens to stay at home on 28 March, but schools opened up at a time after a vacation on 23 March.
A number of countries have also been able to deal with the plague with a eager follow-up, pregnancy, testing, and prevention, but to a little lower resistance, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistics have found that, compared with the number of people who have studied the dead, there are lower examples of death rates, which may be due to the fact that they are in a better position to search out those with or without any symptoms.
WHO recommends that the countries who have no access capacity and have national libraries with limited experience with COVID-19 and send sure first and 10 active samples to the COVID-19 of the 16 trusted libraries of WHO will confirm the search.
Of 16 reliable libraries, 7 for Asia, 5 for Europe, 2 for Africa, 1 for North America and 1 for Australia.
In the following category, the "Containing % check" sample is influenced by the world check policy.
A country that examines only those who are admitted to hospitals will have many confirmed by % of a survey rather than a country that examines all its citizens, whether they show signs or not, some things are equal.
To wash hands (or washing hands), also known as hand washing, hand washing with the intention of removing soil, glass, small objects, or splains.
Cleaning hands with soap at those ‘ critical times ’ during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which combine with oral hygiene.
People can also become infected with respiratory infections such as colds or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, symptoms that have not yet developed).
Five crucial stages during the day when soap - washing is essential include: front and back after release, after washing the diapers or changing the diapers, before and after feeding the baby, before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, inside, and after the food preparation.
Before and after the patient’s care.
After changing diapers or cleaning the child that uses the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing, or coughing.
After touching an animal, animal feed, or pollution.
Hand - washing refers to sanitary practices that have a bearing on medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medicine or medical treatment can protect or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main purpose of hand - washing is to wash your hands by washing the hands of the peripheres (bacterial, vicruses, or other agents that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially important for people who carry food or work in the medical field, but it is a vital procedure even for the common community.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of colds, canonavirus, and other infectious diseases; in protecting against the common causes of diarrhea; in reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the mortality rate of infants in giving birth to the home.
The 2013 survey showed that advanced handwashing process may lead to less development during the development of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of young people associated with respiratory infections and diarrhea can be reduced by starting a change of life - style, such as by washing hands with soap.
A simple action may reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by about 50%.
Steering methods that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea in three parts, and this can be compared to operating clean water in poor areas.
The reduction of diapers in 48% can be linked to the washing of hands with soap. Handwashing is one method that works well and is less expensive in order to protect the diarrhea and respirations (ARI), as an automatic behavior occurring in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
The main ARI, which leads alone as a cause of infant death under five years of age, destroys an estimated 1.2 million children's health annually.
The diarrhea and pneumonia both contribute to the death of about 3.5 million babies each year.
According to UNICEF, converting hands to soap before and after using the toilet to become a strict routine can save more health than any single remedy or medical intervention, determining death for the cause of diarrhea and about half death from respiratory infections.
Handwashing is usually associated with other discharges as part of water, garbage and sanitation (WASH).
Handwashing also protects against embroids by direct contact.
A minor accident is the result of regular handwashing by skin damage caused by dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can have a effect on the bite, the shape of the skin known as a dzema or a dermatitis, which is most common to people who are health - care workers.
More handwashing is also seen as one of the symptoms of optical disorder (OCD).
There are five crucial times during the day when soap washing is necessary to reduce the transmission of the disease by oral hygiene: after use of the toilet (to wash, relieve yourself), after washing the diapers (turning the diapers), before or after feeding a baby, before or after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or birds.
Other times when proper handwashing should be followed in order to avoid the transmission of disease includes both before and after treatment of a cut or injury; after a sneeze, a cough, or a sneeze; after touching an animal’s thumb or handling animals; and after handling dirt.
In many countries, there is a low level of soap - washing.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on the average, 38.7% of families follow the soap - washing process. The 2011 study showed that Saudi Arabia had a very high level of 97 percent; the United States near the middle of 7 percent; and China at a very low rate of 23 percent. A few traditional practices are now in developing the practice of accepting handwashing at critical times. It is the practice of child washing hands as a group at the appointed time of children in one developing countries.
The "Essential Health Care Program" launched by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the work of encouraging children's health and education.
Twice a year, accompanied by regular washing of hands with soap, daily brushing with fluoride, is a pillar of national order.
It is also successfully started in Indonesia.
Removing microorganisms from the skin is better equipped with soap or cleaning water.
The main function of soap and cleaning is to reduce the solution, and raise the soluability.
Water alone is not enough to clean the skin because fat and proteins, which are material, are not easily melted in the water.
But cleaning helps with the flow of water to an extent.
A soap made from soap, which is able to replace it, may keep the virus alive in the first place.
A small number of studies that monitor the transmission of the virus from a tracheotomy have concluded that it is impossible to keep bacteria clean and toxic.
The CDC still goes on and is that the "smoking soap and handling without hands is better."
Antiviral soaps are widely advertised by health - care communities.
To this day, there is no evidence that using antigens or disinfects is designed to select natural antibiodic-restant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps have normal antibacterial representatives such as tricrosan, which contains a long list of organisms.
Thus, even if antibiotic resistant samples are not selected for antibacterial soap, they may be able to function properly in the manner it is sold.
Otherwise surfactant and representative of skin protection, complex structures may contain acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, acetic acid) as management of pH, antiprimitive bezoic acid and other skin cares (aloe vera, vitamin, etc. An analysis of the U.S. University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that non-insibals are effective in the same way as non-indial, anti-aidental, anti-insic, anti-idental, anti-idental, anti-idants, and anti-identatracts.
Hot water with which to wash your hands does not burn them to the proper extent so that they can die of germs.
Bacteria grow very much when the temperature of the pond is 37 degrees Fahrenheit [37 ° C].
Yet, warm, soapy water works better than cold water, which contains soap from natural fats that absorb soil and germs.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not contribute to reducing microbial lead in the hands.
The uninitizer or unicode antiseptic is a representative of water-made handkeeping.
At the end of the 1990 ’ s and early part of the 21st century, representatives of hand washing water (also known as alcool-bed dubs, anti-intentitian bubs, or manizers) began to experience a residation.
Many based on the sopropyl alcol or ethanol that was grown together with a hot agent such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) made the mugin, or pioctant as a glycerin, or foam so that it would be easier to use and reduce alcohol thirst.
Imperation hydrogen-peroxide increases the production of antimicrobials. Analnitizer with alcohol 60 to 95% effectively kills germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizer kills bacteria, multi-drug resilitative bacteria (MRSA and VRE), Tubbulosis, and other bacteria (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rranvirus, rancivirus, influenza, and hepatitis).
Alcohol rubies with 70% of alcohol killed 99.97% (3.5 kg), as with 35 decibels reduced) of hand infections in 30 seconds after treatment and 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 kg) of bacteria in the hands of 1 minute after urination. Handinitzers function better and less slowly on certain bacteria.
An alcohil-size chain is almost completely useless to the norovirus (or Norrolk) type of bacteria, the main cause of a multistantterititis. sufficient anti-intensed anti-inform or alcohol rub should be used to soften it completely or cover both hands.
The front and back of both the hands and the inside and the ends of the fingers are rubbed around about 30 seconds until the liquid, the foam or the gall is dry.
The fingerprints must be cleaned with them, washed on both hands. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention encourages washing the hands rather than rubbing their hands with sanitizers, a knob when the hands are obviously smooth.
The rise in the use of these representatives is due to their simple and quick performance of the power to kill micro-organisms; however, they should be used to take the proper handwashing except where soap and water are not available.
Regular use of alcocols may cause dry skin except when allieth and/or skin braces are inserted.
Alcool dry process can be reduced or eliminated by inserting glycerin and/or enzymes into a combination.
In medical research, alcocols are based on almollies that make more beautiful skin and dryer than soap or antimicrobials.
Alergic counterct dermatitis, contaminia syndrome or hyperactivity to alcohol or acidis available in non-alcool light rubbs.
The lower condition of bringing up the central core typet dermatitis to be appealing compared with the washing of hands with soap and water.
Regardless of their effectiveness, waterless representatives cannot clean their hands on natural objects, but they only kill germs.
For this reason, the uninitizers are not as efficient as soap and water in preventing the spread of many nitrogen, as the peripheres continue to be in their hands.
The success of the tinitizer without alcohol depends largely on the ingredients and combinations, and in record they are more efficient than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, the combination of abalconium chloride has shown the persistence and increase in the work of antiviral after anointing, in contrast with alcohol, which has been shown to reduce work levels after repeated activity, may be the reason for continued reaction of the skin.
Many people in poor economically poor communities cannot buy soap and use ash or dust instead.
The ash or soil may function better than the water, but it works less than the soap.
One of the concerns is that if soil or ash detects the contamination of micro-organisms it may raise the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a representative of the virus because when it is mixed with water, a mixture of alkinine is formed.
WHO encourages ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
The appropriate handwashing process encouraged by the US Centers for Disease Control for Prevention of Transmission include these steps:
Wash your hands with cold or cold water.
The flow of water is encouraged because standing brass can be contaminated, whereas the temperature or temperature of water does not distinguish it.
Wash your hands with adequate soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Cotton generates germs in the skin, and studies show that people often do better to wash their hands when soap is available than when they use only water.
Run at least 20 seconds.
Flirtation generates heat, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and long - term infestation removes more bacteria.
Clean up well under running water.
Cleaning the face may defile the hands
You dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Drought and thin hands are easy to take for granted: areas that easily forget the thumb, the wrist, the middle of the fingers, and under the nails.
The nail nails and rusted nail polylish can store microorganisms.
A winnowing lead is often encouraged to keep your hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can cause infection.
Different inexpensive procedures can be made to meet hand washing where tap water and/ or soap are not available. To pump water by placing an appropriate vessel or drum and/or using a pot if needed in developing countries. In conditions with limited water (such as schools or rural areas in the developing world), there are some useful methods of water conservation, such as "tippy-taps" and other forms of saving money.
Tippy-tap is a simple method of using a rope- bound whip, and a foot sawing whip that gives little water to the hands and soap.
A effective handwashing is an important part of the process of handwashing, but there can be a dispute over how best to dry up in public toilets.
A growing number of studies suggest that paper towels are better cleaner than electricity emissions that are found in cleaning areas.
In 2008, a study was directed by the University of Westminster, London, and supported by the European Tssue Symposium - paper bulletins, to compare the level of cleanliness found in paper cans, hot - air dry hands, and the latest air sweating hands.
After washing and drying the hands with hot flashes, the total number of bacteria was found to be rising at the rate of the fingers by 194% and the hand feet by 254%.
Fast ventilation was effective at the total number of bacteria on the fingers by 42% and at the hand feet by 15%.
After washing and drying the hands with paper paper, the total number of the virus falls down on the fingers by 76% and on the fingers by reaching 7%. Scientists also took a study that would provide an opportunity for a combination of cleaning and cleaning areas as a result of each method of drying.
A quick air-cushion pump, which absorbs the air from it at a fixed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), has succeeded in pumping micro-organisms into the hands and nearly infecting other users and cleaning areas about 20 feet [2 m].
The use of hot air has laid the micro-organisms up to 30 feet [0.25 m] from the boiler.
The paper towels did not show the obvious windowsing of micro-organisms. In 2005, a search directed by TWOV Produk undult undwelt, different laying methods were tested.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after handwashing were noted:
There are many manual manufacturers present, and hand braces have been compared to dryeres.
Washing hands using old manitings is another way when traveling in soap and water.
An alcohol-built tinitzer structure must have alcohol at least 60%.
Medical washing was long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis found his work (1846) in protecting the disease in the hospital.
There are electric generators operating with a note reminding hospital workers to wash their hands when they forget them.
One study has found a reduction in disease levels by means of operations.
Medical washing takes about 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or a canal to anoint or rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed together by rubbing their fingers.
If there is uncleanness under the nails, the crystal buru can be used to remove it.
Since germs can sit in the water in the hands of the hands, it is important to thoroughly clean and dry up with a clean towel.
After the drying, the paper towel must be used for closing the water (and opening any exit if possible).
This avoids further contamination from such sites.
The idea of washing hands in the care condition is to remove the messogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that permissive handwashing continues to continue to be unacceptable in many medical places, with a large number of doctors and nurses continually forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus passing on microorganisms.
One study showed that hand washing in a manner and other simple procedures can reduce the level of cateter-releted blood abuse by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing handwashing and washing hands in the field of health care.
Organizational instructions for handwashing can be found on its cassette so that the public can observe it.
A proper return is guided by the Witby et al.
Clusters in stores can measure and ensure the purity of the hand, if proving and complying with the law is necessary.
The World Health Organization has "five times" to wash hands:
after a blood transfusion/blood transfusion
before the use of an objectpttic, once
and after treatment of the patient. Getting anti-inflammatory chemicals into the urine ("a tree" or soap "ressicides") gives the power to kill in that handwashing.
That power may be required before surgery or in cases where antibiotic-resis is plentiful. 'Strounding to someone for the purpose of surgery, it is necessary to have a pump that can be opened and closed without touching by hand, chlorhedy or iodine ash, masterile towels to dry the hands after washing, and sterile brushing and another washtle in the foot under the feet.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires hand and arm washing to the spinal cord, usually 2-6 minutes.
Long hours of rolling (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When you snarls, the water in the arm should be prevented from running back to the hands.
After finishing the washing of the hands, the hands are stopped with a metal cloth or a surgical garment is worn.
To minimize the spread of the virus, it is better to wash the hands or use hand - to - hand vaccination before and after treatment.
In order to control the diseases of Staphylocoal in hospitals, it has been found that great gain from clean hands comes from the first 20% of sanitation, and that very little extra help is available when repeated handwashing is raised over 35%.
Washing with empty soap has a three-fold effect of eating contaminated food when compared with washing with a handbing soap for alcohol-bebelud solution. To compare a big piece with an antibacterial solution for a metamer of 30 times a metacond i.e. the alkhodhol might be caused by the alcohol carcial delivery system 26% morethan.
But soap and water function better than alcohol-beed bullbs in reducing H11 influenza A virus and Clordium Deficole pumps in the hands. The intervention to improve hand hygiene in health care may include teaching the staff by washing hands, raising the availability of alcohol-Bed hab, and reminders written and said to the staff.
There is a need for further research that investigates which of these methods of intervention works best in different health - care conditions.
In developing lands, soap - washing is recognized as a means of saving, an important aid to health, even physical nourishment.
Yet, a lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people’s homes, schools, and workplaces makes it a challenge to reach the world’s hand - washing habits.
In many rural areas of Africa, for example, handwashing taps near private toilets or latrines are scarce, even though there are no means of constructing handwashing.
Yet, low hand - washing levels may be a more serious reason than that of lack of soap or water.
Advertising and standing up for soap - washing can also contribute to legal measures, raise caution for handwashing, and lead to a change in public habits.
For this to be effective, caution is essential.
A careful review of 70 surveys found that the methods of public use to raise hand - washing in LMICs, while social advertising campaigns are less effective. One example of advertising handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Synthetic System" that encourages schools to take simple, improved measures to ensure that students clean their hands with soap, during other sanitary requirements.
When small amounts are reached, schools may move from one to another and eventually up to three stars.
Building handwashing can be part of a campaign to clean hands to reduce the disease and death of infants.
The World's Day for Hand Washing by one of the examples of the activities that promote awareness in an effort to achieve a change of habits. As a result of the 20th-20 connavirus epidemic, UNICEF advertised the widespread use of handwashing.
A few studies have considered the total cost of handwashing in developing countries and social connections and prevention of DALYs.
One return, however, raises the fact that the advertising of soap - washing saves more than the cost of running water and cleaning up.
The importance of washing one’s hands — especially for people under the weak conditions such as newly brought babies or injured soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid - 19th century by two means of physical hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale.
At that time many people still believed that disease was caused by bad odors called maasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks from food and medical - related diseases led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to sell handwashing as an important way to prevent the spread of disease.
The outbreak of blue fever in 2009 and the COVID-19 by 2020 has led to greater caution in many countries regarding the importance of soap washing in the form of infectious diseases.
For example, posters have the inscription "the proper procedure for handwashing" placed up near a washroom in public toilets and private rooms in offices and airports in Germany.
The phrase "Clean your hands" means, to make clear from someone to take responsibility for something or to get involved in it.
Its roots are part of the Bible in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands in making a decision to impassioned Jesus Christ, but we have become a widely used expression in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeeth's Macbeth's Macbeth's first forced her to wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse herself of the prescribed waste, which represents a guilty conscience concerning the crimes she had committed and persuaded her husband to do it.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or thinking about wrong acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and tend to appreciate the importance of handwashing.
Moreover, when they are not allowed to wash their hands afterward they are less likely to share in the "cleaning", such as volunteer activities.
Religion promotes handwashing both the purpose of cleanliness and the model. It is a symbol of cleansing of hands, using water but without soap to wash hands, it is part of the process of washing the hands of many religions, including the Bahha'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and tethlat dalam in Judaism, Lavavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also encourage the washing of hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam force handwashing after use of the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam forces to wash their hands before and after meals.
COVID - 19 Risk Management Management Management
Risk controls instead of the COVID-19 use of ocuctional safety and heath to protect coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate control of risk in the workplace depends on the operation and type of work, by supporting screening the risk of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors for individual employees who may be weakened in avoiding COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Officeal Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low - risk activities have lower contact with the public and other employees, which are encouraged by simple safety measures, including handwashing, encouraging the staff to stay at home when they are sick, breathing habits, and keeping the process of cleaning and killing germs in the workplace.
Risk - related activities include those that require constant contact and are close to people who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but they may be infected because of ongoing social interaction or foreign travel.
This includes employees who can contact the common people like schools, crowded labor, and crowded market conditions.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to simple protective measures, include high-efficiency anti-air processes, sneezeze guards, and freeletion available in cases where a COPD-19 is found.
The OSHA views health and respiratory workers exposed to known people or suspected of having COVID-19 as a higher risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure when workers make aerosol-genating procedres, or take or carry an apecimens from well-known people or suspected of COVID-19.
The necessary safety controls for these operations include construction controls such as auto-building pressure signals, and specialized public health management, which are appropriate for the operation.
development of the*COVID-19 may have serious effects inside the work environment.
Employees may be unemployed because of sickness, the need to care for others, or the fear of being exposed.
Marketing habits may change, both of which are necessary, with ways to obtain these items (such as buying at a time that is not too busy or by means of transportation or traffic).
Finally, the sending of items from the hard-of-reports of COVID-19 may be disturbed. The preparation for a related disease and response program can be used to regulate safety activities.
Programs observe the risk factors involved in different workplaces and types of employment, including the type of exposure, the risk factors rising at home or in public conditions, and the hazards of individuals as high age or of chronic diseases.
They also explain the proper control over those hazards, and subsequent procedures can develop as a result of an outbreak.
Preparation for a related illness and a response program may depend on the promotion of national or regional law.
The goals of responding to the situation include reducing labor between personnel, protecting people at high risk of serious health problems, keeping business jobs, and reducing serious consequences to other businesses and prospective buyers.
The severity of the disease in society is a business that affects the measures taken.
The safety control flight steps are the most commonly used in ocuctional safety and heath to combine risk controls with results.
When the dangers of COVID-19 are not removed, the control that works best on construction management, is followed by handling regulations, and finally the protection of personal safety.
Construction management involves separating workers from work - related accidents without trusting in the worker’s routine, and it can be a big investment when put into place.
Changes in employment or procedures that require a professional or employer’s action
Personal hygiene management (PPPE) is more effective than control of building and management, but it can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE must be chosen based on the job risk, appropriately dressed as appropriate (e.g., passports), always and in a manner, being checked, maintained, and changed, according to the need, be eliminated properly, cleaned, and kept or disposed of.
According to the U.S. Officeal Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low - risk activities have little to do with society and other age groups.
Simple measures of prevention at all workplaces include a number of hand - washing and thorough cleaning, to encourage employees to stay at home when they are sick, to clean up and cool, to operate on latrines and latrines, to prepare for household work or stoves, to encourage workers to avoid using other tools and tools, and to continue keeping the process of cleaning and killing germs in the workplace.
Early detection and isolation of people who may be infected are an important step in protecting employees, customers, employers, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with antispiration symptoms should stay at home until they have no heat, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using anti - hot or antidepressing drugs, and that the laws of days of illness are demanding, allow workers to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that workers know these rules.
According to the OSHA, the internally exposed activities include those activities that require regular contact or close contact with six areas (1.8 m) with unknown or even suspected of COVID-19, have the SARS-CV-2 virus because of continued infection in the community near the workplace, or because someone has recently come back from an outside world that has an extensive contact with COVID-19.
These include employees who interact with the general public as schools, high - risk facilities, and high - risk behavior conditions. Building controls of these high risk groups include install high-level filials, raise the pressure level, restricting limits as plastic flight stoppers, and installing a driver driver - driving screen, control control of the highly affected work group includes encouraging chronic workers to stay at home, install communication systems, create better control systems, replace emergency management, screening, control, control control and screening, control, control control, and screening system, control, control, control, control, control, and control, control, and control of the control of the control of the weapons that are limited to destroying them, control, and destroying them.
Workers in the group are rarely required to use helicopters.
If a person begins to get sick in a plane, appropriate control programs for attack on employees and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 krew to care for the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking the patient to cover his mouth and nose with a cough or a sneeze.
A cup of coffee must wear gloves when caring for a sick passenger or affecting body fluids or areas that may be contaminated, and it may be more protective if the patient has a fever, a persistent cough, and a difficulty in breathing.
Glaubs and other missing items should be discarded with a biohazard bag, and areas that have found pollution must be cleaned and contaminated later. As for merchant ships, they include merchant ships and other transporters, control of the plant includes slowing the journey when sick, and to inform the medical center immediately if someone begins to burn or other symptoms while on board.
If possible, follow-to-do therapy must happen to a self-letting person's clinic. In schools and day care, the CDC recommends stopping for a time to clean and kill bacteria if an infected person has been inside the school building, regardless of the spread.
If there are little additions to the middle of society, separation plans may have been started as fueling for thefield trip, meetings, and other large gatherings such as natural education, tea classes or coffee classes, increased room between desks, arrivings and return visits, hugs with unimportant visitors, and the use of a different office of children with symptoms of coldlike symptoms.
When the virus spreads dramatically to the public, despite efforts to separate people, it may be considered closed schools. In the day - to - day law workers, health risk is considered lower by the CDC.
Legal personnel who must contact certain persons who are suspected of having a COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as those of health emergency workers, as well as human safety requirements.
If there is a close relationship when a person is found, the workers should clean and remove the germs from their work belts and clothing before reuse them with a spray or cleaning cloth, and follow traditional measures to prevent the spread of the virus and disposal of PPE used and the washing of clothes.
The OHA estimates that certain medical and respiratory workers are at greater or greater risk of exposure to disease.
The services of those exposed to serious risks include medical agents, relief supplies, libraries, and medical personnel who are exposed to known patients or suspect that they have COVID-19.
These become the greatest risk of exposure to disease when employees perform procedures that produce aerosol, or collect or handle samples, from known patients or suspected of having COVID-19.
The procedures that produce aerosol include the insert of a tube in the body, the process of coughing, bronchoscopies, procedures and dental examination, or the preparation of a synapses.
The activities of cold exposure to the most dangerous disease include employees involved in preparing bodies for known conditions or suspect that they have a COVID-19 when they die; these are a major danger if they study the dead bodies. More computer systems of these groups include separate housing rooms known or suspects that have aCVID-19, including where there is a form of aerosol development.
Special air pressure with lead pressure can be suitable for some medical and weather cans.
Samples should be handled with safety guidelines for Biosity Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated from specialized waiting facilities by any suspicion that they have COVID-19. More than another PPPE, OSHA encourages subscriptions to those who work far away from the familiar, or suspect, that they have the SARS-CV-2 virus, and those who develop aerool programs.
In the United States, NIOSH or better - advised facial masks, NIOSH, should be used as a full - written form of defense by fully documented therapists, which include health examinations, exercise, and medical examinations.
Some types of interspertors can further protect and improve a worker’s efficiency. WHO does not encourage the users, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease not by means of body fluids.
WHO recommends only surgery masks to surgical workers in the entranceways.
For those who collect dowsing samples, care, or deliver the COVID-19 without aerosol methods, WHO encourages surgery masks, glasses, or fece shields, gauni, and galg.
When aerosol invented process is performed, N95 or FFP2 assistant instead of surgery masks.
Because PPE is not available enough in the world, WHO encourages reducing the need for PPPE by telephone contacting, physical restraints such as these show, which only allow those directly involved to enter a clinic with COVID-19, use only the needed PPE for some activity, continuing to use the same extension without removing it while caring for many patients with the same disease, being cautious and controlling the availability of PPE, and avoiding the use of masks to people who have no symptoms.

DAY/ TIME FORMAT: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
PURPOSE: CC0: No absolute rights
We find ourselves in a unique situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear indication of how people in the world relate to one another.
We have never faced the same challenges, but we know that our reaction is largely based on the kind of empathy, cooperation, and social factors that are at the root of the organization.
The cooperation and care we have seen in all our employees through e - mails, telephones, and chats is a remarkable guarantee that we have good people with whom to work.
I am truly happy and proud to work along with you.
A week ago, someone told me about our work.
He reminded me of how logical it is for the world to be able to open Wikipedia right now, and this is a powerful symbol for the main source to be found on the Internet and available to everyone.
Your work is doing this work, whether you keep your personal records or our employees in financial or community safety intact.
The world needs the information that is available in Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when we do not only what we do but also how we do it, which will exert a powerful influence on the world around us.
Because of the importance of this work and your role in it, we will make significant changes in our relationship with each other from the next few weeks.
Changes in our Work and in the barn
As Robyn, mentioned earlier, the team has met last evening and discussed how we will work with our new cook for the days and months to come.
In that discussion, we have considered what we have thought would be a positive response to what we are dealing with and the best way to keep the organization going during this time.
Unexpectedly, we want to get rid of the stress and support of our long - term goal.
If you need to drive again, it is good.
Of all the workers, company companies, and volunteer workers:
Our expected daily activity will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until the change is announced.
We do not preach a holiday if you are able to work longer hours, the company can use it.
However, things are uncertain in the world now, and whether you have to care for loved ones, buy food, or consult a doctor, your health comes first.
We will not follow a program of operation.
If you are sick, don’t do anything.
We really do not have to say that, but we will.
You don't have to install sick days or PTO - you will simply tell your supervisor and help your ward adjust the calendars and the shelves to make sure the main parts of the work are being accomplished.
( If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Bryan among the T&C Ops so that T&C will be able to assist you by supporting and ensuring that your condition is properly cared for by the authorities).
Hour workers will be fully paid.
We have already said, and we are reluctant to fulfill our obligations to our employees and those working hours.
Everyone will be paid for his regular working hours in normal conditions.
This includes getting sick and being unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to bring their stress in line with the environment.
What we do may bring unique rewards, especially in times like this.
Once again, it is important to take care of yourself.
We invite you to contact your supervisor, so that we can know what to expect and plan accordingly.
Some work is even considered important.
There are things we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraiing (among others) are doing a serious task that may require further support.
We will begin with a program of all doors to investigate the present goals and focus our attention on the importance of what is important in our goal.
All of us have much to do, but we will all focus on the most important projects.
Adjusting our pace now will not harm us later.
We don't plan to "work again to hold the elevator" when the epidemic is over.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to complete the work at an unusual time right now.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work at setting new goals and new times when appropriate.
What happens to the APP (Annunal Planning)?
In order to change our new circumstances and the hours of work we expect every day, we intended to change the sending of our 2008-20-202s.
Our aim is to suggest the development of our 20th - 2020s, which allows more time to make up a budget to allow the workers to take care of themselves, to care for their loved ones while assisting those who need or wish to work less in the next few weeks.
This extension of the working period greatly reduces the present work schedule and the pressure on the organization as a whole.
We will introduce what we wish to do to Bodi the next week and return representatives to the following steps as soon as we have the assurance.
Thanks to the APP team for taking the lead in this.
Office, exposure, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF employees may be exposed to COVID-19 virus.
Because of great concern, however, we have sent a clean - up crew to remove germs from all parts of the San Francisco office.
Use hospital soap to remove germs everywhere, as well as the reception area of visitors and satellites that enter our area.
The building uses its administrative software using products that support the safety of its compartments.
We feel comfortable that the office will be right when we decide to return.
Our DC office is in Werk, which has shared with us its COVID-19 protocol as well as all the DC workers.
Since last week, our DC office has moved to a remote area completely completed in harmony with the guidance provided by San Francisco.
As some of our NYC workers knew, we had been discussing renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions persist but may take time.
Some of our fellow workers were working far away for the first time.
Our longtime servants know that it would be a great change, and they want to give you advice:
Keep meeting attendance at least an hour or two longer.
If longer meetings are needed, consider how you can separate them within a few days.
Make it clear that the meeting is about you, be flexible, and send out the things that must be learned in advance.
Always do so with a video, with such devices as Google Docs and Zoo so that you can work and communicate directly.
Get the person who will take the lead in preparing for all the meetings, someone to look up the questions in the discussions, and someone to help write notes (or notes all).
Send e-mail to subscribe to technology if you need a good set of self- help.
Use your money for basic expenses.
Mark #remotations to Black so you can talk to your friends about the work you are sending.
The HR Operations team looks to the Internet for guidance in effective operating methods to support the expansion of the work that is sent to the rest of the company.
This past week we asked all who received back money in the community to inform the public of public events sponsored by Wikimedia, such as dynamitetons, WHO until the epidemic was over.
We will tell them that we have come to understand that our request for more freedom and that we are not likely to be unable to finish their proposed retirement plans and that no one will be exempt by delay or change goals.
In the following week we will follow further direction to Wikimania and other social and class colleges.
The general feeling of the world’s population seems to be a general frustration with the disorder but relief from the explanation and opportunities to focus on their communities, Wikimedia, and so forth.
In time, CRTC works to insert a page from the Meta-Wiki so that it can be given a community space to view the effects and follow our conversations with them.
To stay connected with issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special labor assembly.
We will use the time to share return visits, answer your questions, and spend some time together.
We work together and will help you wherever you can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive information about this mail, with all the related COVID-19 related information, fromOffice Wiki.
A CRTC will keep these pages separately and all information in the same location.
We also work to keep regular contact with workers living in lands currently deeply affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, trade routes, the challenge of the library, and anything else you may need to help, please do not hesitate to tell you and work with the CRTC.
We are here to help when needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please send a e - mail to Bryan Juda - Director of the HR International Global Applications.
None of these changes should be viewed as sacrifices to care for our responsibilities.
Rather, it is a realization that at this time, our work and obligations will likely need to be well - adjusted as never before.
These steps, which they believe, are necessary in order to support each other so that we can carry on the work, provide our group with support, and the world to give you a sense of security.
The work we plan to do will be waiting for us when the time comes.
In the meantime, it is time to support one another and make room for important work that may take place in the weeks and months to come.
We need all of you to do that, so we need to take care of you and your families so that you can be fully prepared when the need arises.
Now, we beg -- stretch out your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the whole Group of Leaders (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janen U, Lisa, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan, Ryan, M, and Toby N).
The b'Angiotsin-conning enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an external enzyme (in the cell membrane) of the cells in the lungs, nerves, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 combats the function of angiotsin-conning enzyme (ACE) by reducing angiotsin-I and raising Ang(1-7) as a promising treatment for heart and blood diseases. ACE2 also serves as an entry into certain coronavirus cells.
A human enzyme is usually referred to as hACE2.
Angiotsin-conning enzyme 2 is metalloenzyme, which is found on endotial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains N-ter-festaise M2 signatures and C-terminal collecrin renal amino acid into transfer.
ACE2 is a single - line membrane protein I, with its enzymes exposed to the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
An outside cell of ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane in the enzyme known as herdanise, and the decompressed protein is then pumped into the blood and eventually leaks into the urine.
ACE2 is present in a number of cells: ACE2 is associated with the cell primarily with the cell cell II cells of all types of alcohol, entrocytes in smaller cells, and endometrial cells, and soft nerve cells in many cells.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in crebral cortex, stritum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE secretary.
ACE separates angiotsungen I hormone into voltagesic acids II.
ACE2 distinguishes carxyl-said arcyl-agenine from angiotsian II (Isp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Tyr-H-Pro-Per) and divides it into vardillator iotsion (1-7), (H-Isp-Val-Val-Tyr-H).
ACE2 can also divide a number of peptices including [des-Arg 9] bradykinin, anapelin, neuroterin, Dynupin A, and grelin.
The ACE2 also manages the movement of the netral amino acid transmission SLCA19 and is included in Hartnup's disease.
Like Transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entrance to certain coronavirus cells, which include HCV-NL63; SARS-CV (SARS virus); and SARS-CV-2 (CVIV-19).
Pointedly, the combination of Spike S1 SV-COV and SARS-CV2 protein in the enzyme of ACE2 on the face of cells results in endocytosis and the movement of both bacteria and enzymes to the endosomes between cells.
This entry procedure also requires making S protein protein TMPRS2, a barrier under current tests as a treatment for disease. This has led some to conclude that reducing the symptoms in ACE2, in cells, can help combat the infection.
However, many highly active organizations and organizations have encouraged a normal ACE prevention and treatment of ARB.
"Reformation and updates published on July 11, 2012, found that "" using ACE restraints was associated with 34% greater reduction in pneumonia risk compared with controls."
"In spite of this," the problem of pneumonia has been reduced to patients with ACE vaccines who have been at greater risk for pneumonia, especially those of stroke and heart disease."
"The use of ACE vaccines has also been linked to the reduction of patients dying from pneumonia, although the effects were less serious than the damage that pneumonia can cause."
A human combination of ACE2 (rhCE2) is thought to be a new treatment for severe lung damage, and it seems to promote pulmonary hemodynamics by releasing oxygen from the pigs with apopolysasasasaridide-ind antispirated respiratory stress syndrome.
Part of the hyACE2 for humans takes 10 hours to work and begins after 30 minutes more than your working time (a period) for 24 hours.
One study indicates that rACE2 can be a suitable drug for those who are unable to drink traditional creinn-angiots inititors (RAS initins) or in diseases where angiotsin II is active. The prevalence of rhACE2 has been diagnosed in a medical research for treating a respiratory disorder.
"Apps from b'COVID-19 are software software programs designed to help you find numbers in connection with the 20th-20 Cronanavirus epidemic, such as a contact process (") that they may have had contact with an infected person."
A number of programs have been developed or even considered, with government legislation in some places.
There have been the development of the amplifiers.
Secret concerns have been voiced, especially regarding the masts based on the location of the amp.
Other methods that do not need confidential information include the use of Bluetooth crystals to replace the user’s position with other young ones.
On 10 April 2020, the Google and the Apple announced that they would build a way to support such applications in Bluetooth directly from the OS in Androd and OS.
In China, the Chinese government, dealing with the Alipay, has developed an ap which allows citizens to examine whether they have had contact with COVID-19 people.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, a tap is used as TraceTogther.
"This application was developed by local IT workers, released as an open source and will be given to the government. In Northern Macedonia it was issued "Stop Korona!"", "Ap works on Bluetooth to pursue access to people who may be infected and given immediate reactions to health authorities."
This application was developed by the Department of Communications and Technology and the Department of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the apply was expected to be approved by the Google Play Store and the Appp Draw.
"On 12 April, the government said that the search application was in a advanced stage of development, and it was to be available to be released within a few weeks. Similar apply to Ireland, and France ("Stop Covid").
Both Australia and New Zealand consider Singapore’s Trace Togourer-based applyers and BlueTrace platforms. Russia is intended to establish an icon which is displayed when a person crosses the limited boundaries of COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they are not displaced.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at Cambridge University, lists several factors that can be a problem with apms, including misleading warnings and chances of not receiving a warning if the app’s power is limited to only a small number of people.
"To resolve problems related to the ap "e-coronavirus" that is misleading or dangerous, the Apple set limits on the types of organizations which can insert coronaviruss into its Approviruss, said they will be only those of "custom" or trusted organizations."
Google and Amazon have established similar boundaries.
Secretary partners have expressed their concern about the problems of mass detection using connavirus scanners, especially in regard to whether the process of detection is designed to deal with the coronavirus epidemic will be stopped after the crisis has passed.
The Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement that limits this type of search.
These have established nine points in government policies:
"A search should be" lawful, required and appropriate" "" "
the development of the period of awareness and observation should have matters of solar eclipses;
The use of the data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
the protection of the map and the knowledge of words will need to be protected and shown as a defense based on evidence;
a biopsy should avoid lowering the risk of prejudice and reducing the value of things;
whatever sharing of the table with other people shall be legally justified;
there should be caution against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
"Accumulative participation is for all "" participants" will be required, which includes public health professionals and small groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohne Gshan) will also produce test lists."
The proposed Google/Applet program is intended to correct the recurring sequence problem by removing the OS criteria when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries are using a network based on the aps, which eliminate both the need to navigate the ap and avoid following.
In Israel, a network-based sequence was authorized.
Negotiations based on technology that can reach the depths of the unregulated area can present serious privacy problems.
However, not all the plants have large servers that need to get to the bottom of a person’s property; the number of secret - protection codes has been built using large servers only to communicate (see below).
In South Korea, the non-prop-based cast was used to follow a person.
Instead of using a marked apple, the plant collects information to various sources that include a quick listing table and a card contract, and combine this in order to send text messages to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this knowledge to warn people who might be infected, the government has also provided local information available to the public, which is recognized as a result of many changes in privacy policies after the MERS outbreak.
This knowledge is available to the public by app and a database. The countries including Germany have considered using both the main masts and those that protect privacy.
Since April 6, 2020, details have not been published.
The security measures are a well designed method, with many research publications from at least 2013. Since 7 April 2020, more than 12 teams of experts have sought solutions that accept confidential solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to draw closer to user and other young people.
However, the PIP-PT is an effort to connect both large and wide, and it is not a single protocol. Various protocols include Decentralyd Privy-Preserving Proximity Trafficing (DPPT/PPPP-3T), Telmpara Contattat Evermers (TN, CEN), Projectcy Prostitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Modern Conflict Traffic (PAT) and others.
In these protrusions, man’s visible body never abandons the ladder, and all the unions do not break down.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been establishing the Safe Pats, a platform for using privacy precautions when collecting and using a space or metastat to track the progress of COVID-19.
"It is based on a search from the white paper "Faps Gone Rogue: Mainating Personal Privacy" published in an Epidemiic" published in March 2020. One similar attempt is the Sfefetrace platform of the Enigma MPC, the first secret company founded in the MIT Media Tab."
The Safetrace uses secure technology to allow users to share the serious environmental and health of the area and other users and the law, without putting the matter at risk.
On April 5, 2020, the international TCN Coalition was formed by groups associated with what had been the very different means, with the aim of reducing the distinction, and is allowed worldwide use of the aps for inspection and warnings, an important feature of wide acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that he had issued an invitation for the BlueTrace public to be used by its official government agency.
On 10 April 2020, the Google and the Apple, the companies that control the small platforms of Andreid and OS, announced the way of identity detection, and asserted that it would protect privacy, based on the Blueooth Low Energy and cryptography technology.
They also print the technology used in the industry.
In accordance with the Apple and Google, the screen is intended to be removed in three categories:
to allow governments to build legal approximate fans to register coronavirus to protect privacy.
installation this feature directly into the IOS and Andreid Google and the Apple order to correct the problems of starting and continuing awareness by sending the System first with OS revisions, and later releasing it in the same way after the threat has passed.
The b'Drug repositioning (also known as the re-use of a tree, re-profiling, re-tasking, or depeulic switching) is a reuse of a known drug to treat another disease or a different health condition different from the one it was created.
This is a form of scientific research currently being done to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research guidelines include the development of the COVID-19 and the installation of a system of blood plasma. SARS-CV-2 have about 66 proteins that are able to use a tree, each with a number of crystals.
A review of the sites in which they are included constitutes a reasonable program to establish a drug against COVID-19.
Of the most important profiles of SARS-COV-2 are proteasis, RNA polymerase based on RNA, herlicase, Sprotein, and ADP rophaspatase.
Hussiein A, and others have investigated a number of drugs that can be used and developed and analyzed the parallels of its structure with the same high - grade drugs in order to speed up the development of the strong SARS-CV-2 vaccine on the pre-CV treatment that can be used as a research drug.

New York’s governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the research of the New York District of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authority (EA).
The treatment has not yet been approved by the FDA medical research and is authorized under EUA only as a research therapy to use emergency conditions for hospital patients who are unable to accept treatment in medical research.
"CDC" means "to use, volume, or a period of hydroxychloroquine to prophylaxis or the treatment of SARS-COV-2" is not correct."
"Doctors said they used a drug when there's no other method."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts little research on the use of chloroquine in combination with Zinc, vitamin A, Vitamin C, and Vitamin D.
Great research continues at Duke University and University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School conducts the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to prevent disease.
"China's medical research in Wuhan and Shenzhen says that favipivir "is quite effective."
Thirty - 35 patients in Shenzhen were diagnosed with a respiration during 4 days, while the height of illness was 11 days for 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan for 240 cases with pneumonia, half was given favipavir by another half to the tifanovir.

"One study oflopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of anti-invasiavir and tritonavir, concluded that "There's no "induction" found."
These trees were designed to prevent HIV from repeated contact with proteasse.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to alter drugs to acquire a fluid to join the SARS-CV-2 prognosis. There are critics in the scientific community by directing efforts in reusesing products specially designed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO consists of thelopinavir/ritonavir in the Joint Global Research.
The Remdesivin was built and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg diseases. The Gilead Sciences found that Remdessir had the role of combating the virus on the Vitro in the counter against the viruses of Filo-, pneummo-, paramyxo-, and corona-.
One problem with antibiotics is the development of mutation therapy that can lead to a serious and infectious disease.
A previous study suggests that remdesir may have a high genetic barrier to the drug operation. There are a number of ongoing medical studies, which include two in the Cleveland University Hospitals; one for those with moderate illnesses and one for the most chronically ill.
There are three continuing medical studies for the vitamin C of patients who are hospitalized and who are seriously ill with COVID-19; 2 mines (in China, Canada) and one unsupervised (Italy).

Since SARS-COV-2 is a virus, science has concentrated on reuse of antimicrobial drugs that have been developed by earlier diseases such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribabilin:ribian was proposed to treat COVID-19 in accordance with 7 Chinese guidelines.
Umifenovir:umifernovir was proposed to treat COVID-19 in accordance with 7 Chinese guidelines programmes
Some antibiotics that have been found as alternative to COVID-19 treatment:
Tocicizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Enforced in China.
In the survey also in Italy and China. See Tocicizumab#COVID-19.
The objective of the B'A COVID-19 is an imaginary goal against Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no end to medical research, there are many continuing efforts to develop such a goal.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was not expected that the objective of SARS-COV-2, the virus, could be achieved within 18 months.
Five vaccines were held in the Department of Safety Research in April.
The COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
The greatest explosion in the world took place in 2020, leading to a great financial and research project for the development of a goal.
Most organizations use genes to establish the goals of SARS-CV-2.
Since April, the key elements of CEPI’s project are fast, quickly cleared, produced, and reached on earth.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technical platforms had been investigated and developed early 2020 to form a practical goal against COVID-19.
The main platform operations that developed in class safety I include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA)
Aviral véctor (Organisation of Class I and a range of goals: Can Sinno Biologiecs, adenovirus type 5 occtor)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 15 cents in early stages of the goal were established, and 71 were confirmed as infected programs (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 were announced, but very little knowledge of the available community (which may be planned or established).
Part II survey tests the safety prior to the use and fighting of the virus, usually planned, controlled by a vaccine, and in many places, while the more accurate, effective doses are observed.
The study of Part III usually involves more volunteers, which include a control team, and the effectiveness of a diagnosis to prevent the disease, while serious consequences are performed with proper doses.
"In the 79 goals establishments (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not been studied in the public (who have been in the "prescription"").

In March 2020, the government, industry, and three US universities combine equipment to locate IBM computers, combined with air computers from the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Other goals have a bearing on the effects of other living things, which are also called unpredictable.
That means they can have far more serious side effects on the disease they prevent.
Another informal study in Australia requires the registration of 4,170 health personnel.
Goals may not be safe or effective.
The first study of the effectiveness of a goal is used by animal models at COVID-19, such as the ACE2 infected mouse, some laboratory animals, and human - like animals, showing the need for protection against the 3 virus, and the interaction with other countries in order to ensure safety procedures that work everywhere.
The goals of the SARS and MERS have been studied in models of non-human beings.
Since 2020, there has not been a safe or safety plan for the SARS since the 20th century that proved to be safe and effective for the people.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of new goals and medicines in the treatment of SARS was a major feature of government and public health services worldwide. And there is no established goal for MERS.
When the MERS developed, it was believed that current SARS research can provide a valuable clinic in the development of the goals and treatment of the MERS-CV virus.
Since March 2020, there has been one goal (DNA) of the MERS that completed a class of public medical research, and the other three are still studied, and all are the goals of active-vectors, adenoviral-vectors (ChADOx1-MERS,BS-GamVac), two MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Postposors promote the idea that the virus causing COVID-19 is known and that the goal is already being discovered.
The accounts quoted in various chat rooms refer to the already existing genetic codes as well as the goals of other coronavirus relatives such as SARS coronavirus.
The b'Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) virus is a infectious virus caused by a sere acute respiratory system system system 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Symptoms of a general illness include fever, coughing, and cough.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throats, odors, and stomach pain.
The time from the onset of symptoms is usually five days but from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result from the symptoms of disease, others result in increased pneumonia and multiple amputees.
Since 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in countries and areas, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people in contact, usually by small drops that come out when you cough, sneeze, or speak.
Although these tiny filaments leave their breath, they often fall to the ground or objects rather than into bacteria in long distances.
People may also be infected with the virus and touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live on matter for about 72 hours.
It is most common during the first three days after the onset of symptoms of the disease, though it can develop before the appearance of symptoms and later stages of the virus. A common form of testing is the respiration polymerase hin (RT-PCR) by the liver.
The use of masks is encouraged by those who suspect that they have the virus and their caregivers.
The suggestions for using the mask vary, some authorities say that it is not used, others say that it is not used, and others force it into use.
At present, there is no specific goal or treatment against COVID-19.
The transmission of the virus has been found in many countries in all six areas of WHO.
Those infected may have no symptoms or symptoms such as fever, colds, fatigue, and asthma.
Signs of emergency disease include difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty in getting up, and facial expressions and lips; aid in getting the doctor’s attention as soon as these symptoms appear.
Strange as it may seem, symptoms that affect breathing in the upper part of the body such as nose, colds, or throat may appear.
Signs of the disease in the mouth flowing from the thighs like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed in a variety of percent.
Some incidents in China had developed only the size of the heart and the intensity of the heart.
In others, the disease can worsen into pneumonia, kill many organs, and kill.
This is also called the age of outbreaks of symptoms.
The period of symptoms for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
7.5% of those with symptoms develop during the 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected cases are infected with the symptoms of the disease.
The role of those who do not have the symptoms in transmitting it is not fully understood; however, current evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The number of infected people who do not display the symptoms of the disease is now unknown and studied, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected people have had no symptoms during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include cases of non-invasive cases in its daily numbers on April 1; of 166 infected on that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms during the test.
Both the cough and the saliva can catch the virus.
The big talk produces a number of phrases rather than ordinary ones.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering can lead to a walking of about 15 feet [4.5 m] (15 m).
Although the virus is usually not transmitted into the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it can be transmitted by breathing and that air stations in the hallways outside people's rooms have produced a high - pressure sample of the RNA virus.
Certain medical procedures, such as tube and cariopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the production of crystals to be released into the air and result in a rapid increase in breathing.
Although there is concern that it may continue to increase in public health care, the risk is considered minor, a virus that is highly contagious when people have symptoms of disease; although spread can occur before symptoms can be detected, the risk is less.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it has not yet fully defined how easily the virus is spread, one person usually infects two or three people. The virus lives for hours to days in things.
In particular, the bacteria were found to live for one day on a board, about three days in plastic (polypropylene) and steel (AISI 304), and about four hours in 99%.
This, however, varies from temperature to temperature.
Soap can also serve when used properly; soap products reduce the protective layer of fat, kill it, and remove it from the skin and elsewhere.
Some soaps, such as basalconium chloride and chlorhexedine Gluconate, do not work properly. In Hong Kong research, sweet samples are taken two days after the start of hospitalization.
Of five of the six patients, the first sample showed the high number of the virus, and the sixth patient showed a high level of infection on the second day.
The sincere acture respiratory disorder coronavirus 2 (SARS-CV-2) is a very serious respire respiory system systemrovirus, starting with the release of three pneumonias in Wuhan to many of the worst respiratory infections.
All aspects of the new SARS-CV-2 virus are from coronavirus.
While outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, which explodes its protective balloon. SARS-CV-2 is closely related to SAERS-COV.
The lungs are the most affected in COVID-19 because the virus enters the main cells with angiotsin-conning enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is widely available in the second type of alcohol cells in the lungs.
"The bug uses a special glycoprotein called "" - spike" (peplomer) to contact ACE2 and enter the main cell."
The worst heart damage was found in 12% of infected people who were admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more likely to occur in serious diseases.
The symptoms of high cardiovascular disease, which cause tumors and immune disorders during the growth of the disease, but serious heart attacks may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are most visible to the heart and are involved in heart function.
The case of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboeboelism (25%) is found in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be related to weak prognosis. The evaluation of people killed by COVID-19 has shown Doffuse alveolar marge (DAD), and lymphhocyte in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a hormone for ACE2-expressing respiratory synthesis, critical COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemininflamma.
In particular, the sponge GM-CSF-sreading T-cells seem to correspond to the discovery of IL-6-rening timesocytes and the causes of serious infections in COVID-19 patients.
There have also been reports of lymphocytic infultrates being studied.
WHO has published a number of biological tests.
A common method of testing is the verb verb process by transfer polymerase special action (rRT-PCR).
Tests are usually made on breathing samples obtained from a swabbing tube; however, an nose stra or sputum sample can also be used.
The results usually last a few hours to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but this requires two blood samples taken within two weeks and the results have little value at that time.
Chinese scientists were able to divide part of the coronavirus and print a sequence of elements so that viruses around the world could develop a polymerase scan (PCR) test to identify the virus.
Starting on April 4, 2020, tests on the components of the disease (which can find active viruses and if one has already had a virus) were developed, but not widely used.
Chinese studies show that accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States authorized the first medical examination on March 2120 used at the end of that month. The assessments issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested procedures for detecting the virus based on medical factors and the risk of control.
Bilateral multibar-grand-Glas passes are spread by peripheral, asymmetric, and posteria.
Subpletal dialance, crazy paring (the fever of the volcano system with avarian alveolor factory), and consulification may occur as the disease progresses.
The smallest data available is microscopic loons and COVID-19thophysiology.
The main reasons found in the study were:
Microscopy: supericides, lung console and pulmonary Odema
Four types of pneumonia virus can be identified:
normal pneumonia: pulmonary odema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, rargenial pneumonia, Interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic induction and multinual
critical pneumonia: slow-algar marage (DAD) and dial-alversites.
DAD is the cause of actute respiration disorder (ARDS) and hypoxemia.
destroyed hydadates in alveolar cavites and pulmonary interstial fibrosis
Blood: disergent invascular coagulation (DIC); leukemiarythroblastic reaction
Steps to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands and water frequently for about 20 seconds, practicing oral and nose hygiene, and avoiding eye, nose, or mouth washing with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with a tube when coughing or coughing and encouraging use of the inside of the earring when there is no diarrhea.
Proper handwashing after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC promotes the use of a mask cloth while in the community, in part to reduce infection from people who do not have the symptoms. SDC measures are designed to reduce contact with infected people and large groups by closing schools and workplaces, preventing travel and breaking large conventions.
Distance guidelines also include that people are at least 6 inches (1.8 m) away.
"No known tree works to prevent COVID-19. Since the goal is not expected to be at least 2021, the best way to control COVID-19 to try to reduce the number of those with the virus, called "" to make the line flatten."
The CDC also recommends regular hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when your hands appear dirty before eating and after coughing, coughing and sneezing.
It also encourages the use of at least 60% of a liquefied tire, but only if soap and water are not readily available. In places where handts are not easily available, WHO provides two methods for producing them in the area.
In these ways, the antimicrobial function is from ethanol or sopropanol.
"HDrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacteria from alcohol; "It's not a virus in handwash."
Glycerol is inserted to form moisture.
People are treated with care, which may include treatment of fluids, oxygen delivery, and support of other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect that they have an infection wear a regular face mask.
ECMO has been used to solve the problem of breathing, but its benefits are still considered.
Sanitation, health, and nutrition have been promoted so that you can avoid infection.
Physical therapy may help those with the symptoms of a new infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published suggestions on caring for hospital - based hospital patients with COPID-19.
Innsovists and pulmonologists in the U.S.
Since April 2020, there has been no available treatment for COVID-19.
When symptoms appear, some doctors recommend paracetamamol (acetaminophen) rather than buprofen.
Steps must be taken to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to another, especially in medical areas where procedures may be performed that may produce aerosols, such as intuition or the right mouse replacement.
For doctors who treat people with COVID-19, the CDC promotes human preservation in the Airbone Inspection Roman (AIR) over normal measures, to prevent contact and to breathe the virus. The CDC provides guidelines on the use of personal protein therapy (PPPE) during an epidemic.
Requirements: PPPE mouse, opticor or face mask, eye protection, and doctoral gloves. When found, satellites (in place of facial masks) are encouraged.
N95 respirors are authorized to be used in industry but FDA has allowed masks to be used under the Emergency Use Administration (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air as dust, but protection from certain body components is not guaranteed in use.
If masks are not available, the CDC suggests to use different types of attributes, or, if there is no other, automatic masks.
Most cryptic conditions of COVID-19 are not too bad to require mechanical sensitivity or other means, but some need it.
The form of breathing support for people with respiratory trouble related to COVID-19 is still being studied for hospital patients, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided by high watch and sal cannnula or bi-level conditionation isiray depression.
Whether these two lead to the same outcome for people who are seriously ill is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to live with invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this method reduces the spread of odor crystals compared with hingfrows and sal cannnula. The worst conditions are common for adults (more than 60, particularly over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds, reducing the number of people caused by a failure to manage an unexpected increase in the number of persons with seriously illOVID-19 to be admitted to the hospital.
One study in China found that 5% were replaced with severe cases, 2.3% needed venerable treatment, and 1.5% died.
In China, about 30% of the persons in a hospital with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to ICU.
Ventilation machines become more complex as acute respiratory stress (ARDS) builds in COVID-19 and breathing becomes more difficult.
Ventilators with high pressure control methods and PEEP are required to increase oxygen supply while the risk of damage to the lungs associated with veltilator and pneuthorax is reduced.
PEP may not be found in old ventilators.
Medical research began in January 2020, and several antimicrobial drugs were studied in medical research.
The remsiosvir seems to be the only one to work.
Although 202 will still be developed, several of the new drugs tested have already been authorized for further use or already advanced tests.
Antiviral drugs can be tried for people with a serious virus.
WHO encourages volunteers to assist in medical research that can be used for a while. FDA has temporarily authorized safe immune plasma as a treatment in cases where man is already suffering from adverse effects.
It has not yet entered the medical research needed to prove it safe and effective in treating disease.
In February 2020, a young apple was established in China for handling infection.
Users were asked to enter a name and ID number of ID.
This applet is able to see 'if you are close to a person' using a search engine that may be dangerous to infection.
All users can take note of the condition of the other three users.
If a situation seems to be dangerous, ap not only encourages isolation from people, but also warns health authorities. Examining a number of tables through a youth’s diamond, eye awareness technology, telephone tracking, and developmental information is used to transport infected people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the government of Israel authorized security agencies to follow up on the telephone of people who are thought to have coronavirus.
This is done to keep them separate from the community and to protect those who may be contacting infected citizens.
In March 2020, the Deutsche Telelem shared the chart of the local telephone area with the German government’s agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia developed the ability to detect face - to - face violations.
"The Italian health officer Giulio Galera said she was told to the young workers that "40% of the people are still moving."
The German government is running a 48-hour break computer on the weekend of 42,000 players.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has made a national declaration of coronavirus resolutions.
People may face the stress of living alone, being restricted, having poor health, or being afraid of being infected by the virus themselves.
"BBC has quoted Rory O'Connor saying, "The ongoing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety about health, depression and economic collapse is a storm that affects people’s minds and welfare."
The virus may have minor or minor side effects, including some common respiratory infections like normal colds.
Normal events have been cured within two weeks, while those infected with a severe or serious virus can take from three to six weeks to recover.
Women who are pregnant may be at greater risk of the emergency COVID-19 based on fatigue from other similar bacteria, such as SARS and MERS, but the CaVID-19 statistics are lacking. For some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
For those who are most affected, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) that causes damage to the respiratory, septic shock or damage to most organs.
The problems associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal drive and heart damage, kidney and liver.
Clotting registers, especially the increase in prothrombin time, are found 6% of those admitted to the hospital for COVID-19, while poor kidney function is seen in 4% of the group.
Nearly 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show high liver enzymes.
According to the same report, the average time between the initial symptoms of disease and death is ten days, and five are spent in the hospital.
However, patients who are transferred to ICU have at least seven days between hospitalization and death.
In the study of early stages, the average time from the appearance of the first symptoms to the death was 14 days, a total of six to 41 days.
In a study of the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate is 2.8% while the mortality rate is 1.7%.
Hhastopathological samples of automated lung examinations show only the sine alveor marage and cellular fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic transformation was observed in pneumoctes.
The lung image showed acute respiration disorder (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart damage was noted in high levels of nitrogen or heart position.
According to the March data from the United States, 9% of those admitted to the hospital were already sick. The discovery of medical and economic factors affecting the community may contribute to the death of people.
Measures of death due to the virus vary because of that vary from region to region but also because of difficulty in the means used.
The relatively few conditions can cause the death rate to exceed what is expected.
However, the fact that death is the result of the circumstances of those who have been infected in the past can mean that the mortality rate is now low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to receive the symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to receive care of a crisis or death than nonsmokers. Anxiety about long - term diseases before the virus has been expressed.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has gained 20% to 30% from the use of lungs in other people who are recovered from infection, and in lung teas indicate that it may be damaged.
This can also lead to after serious medical care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was not known that the previous virus can help to provide effective and long - term protection to people who are recovering from the virus.
Defense against the virus seems to be possible, on the basis of other coronavirus, but conditions have been reported in which recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by a brief coronavirus tests later.
These conditions are thought to be the growth of the virus rather than a renal infection.
The virus is thought to be both natural and biological, and then it infects humans.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the virus was probably fully led by its transmission from man to man.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 at Lancet, indicated that the first day of outbreak of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official documents of WHO reported that the symptoms of the first disease had been on December 8, 2019.
Several methods are used to name the dead.
These figures vary from region to region and from time to time and depending on the level of testing, the value of a medical laboratory, the treatment regimen, the time from the earliest appearance and characteristics of people, such as age, sex, and health.
By the end of the 1920 ’ s, WHO distributed emergency documents at ICD-10, U07.1 that were killed by a proven SARS-COV-2 virus and U07.2 was killed by COVID-19 with a medical-reputed SARS-CV-2 virus. The number of deaths is divided into the number of victims during the given period.
According to Johns Hopkins University figures, the number of deaths worldwide is 6.9% (153,822/240,191) on April 17, 2020.
The number varies from region to region. Other methods include caresality rate (CFR), which show percentages of infected designers, and infestation factority rate (IFR), which represents a percentage of people who are infected (nonmainated) who are infected.
These figures are not based on time and follow the number of people from the time of infection to the remedy.
Although not all infected ones are infected with the virus, the presence of disease - causing elements can provide knowledge of how many people are infected.
In a high - risk area in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small area of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) are already dead.
In the Gingel, the virus was aggravated by Carnival conferences, and it fell into youths, leading to low mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 are officially recognized as infected.
In addition, the German health industry has not yet had high prices.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may be infected, as blood donors have studied.
69 (0.004% of the population) were assured that they were killed by COVID-19.
The effect of the epidemic and the mortality rate vary from men and women to women.
Death rates are higher than men in research conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is when they are 50, and the gap between men and women is close only in 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The main reasons for this difference are unknown, but genetic and moral factors may be the cause.
The gender - based virus difference, the lower percentage of smokers in women and men who develop certain diseases such as hypertension when women are younger than women can contribute to a higher number of men dying.
In Europe, 57% of infected men are males and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were males.
In April 2020, the US does not follow the sex - related chart of COVID-19.
Studies show that increased diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A high number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have many opportunities to be exposed to the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the virus will be "COVID-19"."
The director of WHO explained that CO represents corona, VI stands for Virus, D represents disese, and 19 for the year marked by the first outbreak: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen so as not to be named a particular geographic name (such as China), animal or group of people, in harmony with the proposals of various countries intended to prevent discrimination. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called sere acute respiratory disorder 2 (SARS-COV-2).
"WHO also use "COVID-19" and "COVID-19" virus which causes COVID-19" in public chats."
"Both disease and infection are commonly called "" coronanavirus".
"During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "Coronnavirus" and "Wuhan'" coronavirus."
In January 2020, WHO suggested that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCov ancute respiration disease as terms that will be used for infection and disease in harmony with the 2015 guidelines against the use of land in the names of disease and germs.
The legal terms COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 are issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of the lack of supplies in the production industry, some of the producers printed medical equipment such as moths and Ventilators.
For example, when the Italian hospital urgently needed an Ventilator valve, and the surgeon could not send it at the time required, the local company used its own machinery and recorded 100 valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, imaginary news, false and misleading news came about the origin, increase, ban, treatment, and other factors of the disease and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to pass the virus on to other animals.
Research has failed to find evidence of the contamination of pigs, ducks, and poultry.
There is no known cure or effective treatment for the disease.
International research into the goals and medicines of COVID-19 is being conducted by government agencies, schools and industrial research groups.
"By March, the World Health Organization has begun " "FEMPLED Research" to study the results of the treatment of the four anti-inflammatory drugs which are available with great hopes of working."
There is no vaccine already available, but various substances work to establish vaccines.
The past SARS-CV function is used because SARS-COV and SARS-CV-2 both use ACE2 rector to enter human cells.
Three types of vaccines are studied.
First, the researchers intended to develop a vaccine.
The objective of the use of a virus such as this, not working or dead, is to initiate a body response against a new cryptic COVID-19.
The second method, the subunit vanccines, aims to establish a goal that allows the immune system to respond to certain aspects of the virus.
If it is SARS-COV-2, such research focuses on S-spike-spike to help the virus enter ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third option is nucleic acid goals (DNA goals or RNA, a new method for setting a goal).
The goals that are studied in any of these systems will be to be tested for safety and operation. On March 16, 2020, the first medical study of this goal began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The goal contains a genetic code without a threat being copied from the disease - causing virus. Development based on the properties of the disease has been proposed as a challenge to the establishment of SARS-COV-2 goal, but this is not guaranteed.
There are more than 300 medical research that has continued since April 2020.
Seven studies have been studying the already authorized treatment of malaria, which involves the fourth study of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reused antibiotics make up much of the research in China, and a nineth - class study of remdessivin in several countries will send a report toward the end of April.
The powerful replacement of the medical initiatives of COVID-19 and non-use medication had begun, in April 2020. Several available antibiotics are studied in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine,lopinavir/rinavir and cryonicon.
There was tangible evidence for the remsiosir operation, March 2020.
Progress in the treatment of patients is seen in the adequate use of remsodivir.
The medical research of Type III is conducted in US, China, and Italy. chloroquine, formerly used in treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, and results were not yet approved.
However, research results are intended to be studied.
The health authorities of Korea and China encourage chloroquine to be used.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while encouraging the daily volume of one gram, notes that the volume is twice high and can be deadly.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued permission to be used in emergency situations of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the sight of doctors who treated people with COVID-19. The seven courses of China included interferon, ribabin or mifnovir in the treatment of COVID-19.
An unauthorized data indicates that high rubabin levels are necessary to prevent SARS-CV-2 from invitro.
Nanzazaxide has been proposed to a continuous video study after showing the inactive ban of SARS-COV-2. Research indicates that the first rise of protein priming with transmbrane protein 2 (TMPRSS2) is particularly significant in the entry of SARS-CV-2 by related to ACE2.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine along with azithromycin or without them have large boundaries that prevent the medical community from receiving this treatment without continuing research. Oselmatavir does not prevent SARS-COV-2 from thevitro and has an unknown role in treating COVID-19.
The Cytokine storm may be a problem in later classes of cryptical COVID-19 very serious.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine can contain anti-cytone satellite elements. Tocicijumab has been added to medical guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a little research is completed.
A study of subsection 2 which is not scheduled in the national team in Italy was conducted after showing the adverse effects on people with a serious disease.
Associated with a blood test of serum feritin in order to find cytokines so that it is intended to prevent the occurrence of this, which is thought to be the cause of the death of certain affected persons.
The Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was authorized by the FDA on the basis of previous research in treating steroid refractory cytone syndrome caused by various factors, CAR T therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no unpredictable, controlled evidence that toyivumab is effective treatment for CFS.
The transmission of the refined and powerful antibodies produced by those who are recovered from COVID-19 is considered to be a means of limited immunity.
This method was tried on SARS and the results were unknown.
Viral therapy is the expected method used when low - dose treatment can create protection against SARS-CV-2.
However, other methods, such as cellular cytotoxicity based on the properties of disease and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other methods of treating the elements of disease, for example, are developed.
The production of calcium serum, which contains a blood component from recovered patients and which are associated with the virus, can be removed for immediate use.
Coronavirus, group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Hospital, who later became infected and died from COVID-19 after helping to monitor the spread of infection.
