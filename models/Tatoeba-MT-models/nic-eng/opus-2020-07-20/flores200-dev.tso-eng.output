The stars produce light and heat because of the energy produced when hydrogen atoms are combined (or made up of one object) to form strong elements.
Scientists are working to develop a device that will generate similar energy.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to obtain, and it will take years before these devices are developed.
An iron needle gets thrown over the water by the force of the hold.
Contract energy is produced because the water molecules on the surface are much closer than they are to the spiritual molecules on which they are attached.
Water molecules make an invisible skin above the water, allowing inflammatory substances to float over the water.
The iron in the steel in the ice of these days has two curves, which give it the strength to hold the ice, and when it is spherical.

When an ice skates to the right, the rider turns to the right, while the object at the left turns to the left.
To return to the amount of energy they had, they had to remove the extra energy generated from the light.
They do this by releasing a small package of light called "phophoni"
Scientists call the system "transmitter" because the atoms are made by a bright light, which causes them to produce a light box, and a light by the light type of radiation.
The accompanying picture depicts the atoms making up a machine. In fact, the cells are smaller than those in the picture.
Phonographs are few in number than atoms!
