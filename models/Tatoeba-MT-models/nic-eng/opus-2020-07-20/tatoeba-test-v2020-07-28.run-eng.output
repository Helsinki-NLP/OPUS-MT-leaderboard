You have to bring them there.
Why are you at home?
Asa and his father.
Do not give up.
I am new here.
I’ll try it.
We know what you are doing.
What about your father?
I know what they have to say.
Why don’t we go there together?
We’ll see each other again!
Be quiet!
I don’t have a place to live.
You can.
Last year I gave birth to my first child.
I am sure I did.
You are a good person.
Where is your family located?
Better it is not to walk away.
I am not hungry.
I am a senior student in high school.
I lost my keys.
We are not alone.
I want you to know.
I would like to ask you, How are you benefiting from it?
No one knew what should be accomplished.
It made me think.
I am one of your students.
Why didn’t you sign French?
Not as you imagine.
I want to see you.
I’m glad you are there.
When Do You Stand Up?
Tom knows why?
What is my hour?
We have no money.
Forgive Me!
I do not need them.
I talked to my parents about it.
There is no other way.
I know what to do.
I know.
It is very good.
When it does not simply lie down, it is too late.
I lost my wallet.
When Do You Stand Up?
You can find the most fascinating color of all.
All day long it is.
They have no money.
You are a good parent.
Come or Come?
I want to carry it in.
Will You Make Sacrifices for the Kingdom?
I lost my head.
Come, now, you people.
He is my father.
I’m curious.
What does he not understand?
I don’t think he will.
I’m not sure.
They say that he is very rich.
His Word was remarkable.
I don’t want to cook.
Do not do that again.
No one knows him well except his parents.
I was able to do so.
I don’t think he will.
He was left alone.
The sun shines directly east.
Why not?
It will be very good.
There is no harm in doing so.
I remember the first time.
Do you want to take them?
Has it been adopted by Jehovah?
Please, separate from me.
My brother was away from home.
My parents called me below.
What do they do here?
Do you have a brother?
Look at the picture.
I am confined to a wheelchair.
What are you able to do?
Is this your mother?
Why are the heavens like blue?
If you do not, come with you.
This car is our home.
No one here has a car.
Decide for Us!
I do not know.
Light.
I’m glad you are there.
Are you?
Forget it!
What is the purpose of this test?
They don’t give me a chance.
My daughter is to be married six months.
I know these women.
I understand what you are saying.
It makes me feel good.
Where do you know my name?
Would you like to do so?
Is It Love?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are twelve months of year.
I have a question.
I heard that you were married.
Will You Walk or Do You?
In the past, he was a teacher.
Be willing to give up the fight.
I was devastated!
Whom do you see with me?
I can see that.
You want to see it.
A vow is a loan.
You are not alone.
I don’t like these people.
Do you want something to drink?
Are you happy?
Absolutely!
No one listened.
I think it’s yours.
Take a taxi to the hotel.
You don’t come, do you?
Here comes that dreamer!
They do.
I don’t know how long.
Whose altar is this?
Return?
Never may that become so!
No one knows what to do.
Do not gaze about.
I’ll ask him.
We returned.
I’ll look at you.
I know so much about you.
There is no harm in doing so.
I want to learn French.
My car breaks down.
You know that I love you.
I know him.
Listen!
I know what to do.
I know what is going on.
She lost her car key.
Why aren’t you here with me?
Can I see it again?
Do you know how to separate the sheep from the goats?
You don’t know my brother.
I will take you to school.
Do I Know Tom?
Are You Moved to Act as Jesus Was?
May I come back?
That is why I love you.
Are you one of them?
Sooner or later, it will likely become.
Please, give me a job.
It’s on the front.
It is hot.
You know that I love you.
The bed is hot.
Our journey comes from time to time.
I accepted the offer.
What would you like to see?
How are you going to school?
Are You a New Partner?
I know what to do.
Do you enjoy learning?
Do you possess money?
I don’t know.
I know exactly how to work.
What were sandals?
I’m glad you are there.
This book is very fine.
Thank you for taking our life.
I respect them.
Wait a minute!
He is vigorous in power.
It is worth five dollars.
I returned home to my mother.
You are right.
Your coat is dirty.
I am raising you up.
Thank you for making it possible for you to do just that.
Do you enjoy learning?
I will give it to you.
Drink a cup of wine.
I want some of them.
You are my friend.
Where is our car?
No one knows what to do.
What school are you pursuing?
You never want to know!
She is a good student.
He makes me think.
Receive a copy of the book.
I don’t have a home.
Thank you very much.
I know you’re saying that.
I think about it.
He is happy.
I was hungry.
I don’t know.
Do not do that.
I thought you were going home.
My daughter is soon to be married.
He was raised by his grandmother.
And so on.
I want to return home.
They do not know.
I have a brother.
I made this comeback.
How long will you maintain it?
I leave the house before eight o'clock in the morning.
I gave up my jewelry.
Why are they here?
What is love?
We discern.
I love this book.
Would you please read those verses?
You are my favorite wife.
I’ll be happy with that.
It is up to us.
Where is your family located?
Do not say the same thing again.
Please, I’ll send you to my copy.
Where are we going?
I’m not sure.
You know where I will be.
What is the purpose of your visit?
We are happy to see them.
I know that girl.
End the car.
I didn’t understand why.
Do you know what to do?
We know it.
No, for he did not.
Where would you like to live?
I love the place I live in.
Do not ask.
Should I open the door?
Cut a few drops of rain.
Where are you going?
Be happy, even if you have a lot of fun.
You have to go home.
Is this the case?
Are you learning French?
You will be more repentant.
To visit me.
Where is my car?
I don’t know.
There I met my sister.
I know what I am doing.
I gave the boy a book.
Who is your teacher?
I will do it for you.
The girl looks like a boy.
I have no brother.
Sadly, a close friend of mine had to move to another city.
Your father?
You know I have to go.
Here is your copy.
It is not my day.
How long has he been sick?
If he had stayed home that day, it would have been easy.
He speaks not only English but also German.
I’m not happy.
I know what is going on.
I know he knows.
It’s good, isn’t it?
I know what you think.
Fierce.
That was why I had to change the cup.
Better it is not to walk away.
The girl looks like a boy.
I love to.
I have to let my hair grow long.
Too Little?
He’s my brother.
I am happy and joyful.
Do you have time to help me?
Give your child a chance.
I don’t know how to use that name.
Do you know what love is?
Saturday is the day of the wedding.
I don’t want to die.
Tell me about your plans.
This book at a table is a good place to hide.
I lost my wallet.
Thank you for coming.
I am a cook.
Someone is standing behind the wall.
I dropped out of school.
Yes.
Did you notice it?
Are they watching us?
Are You a Good Priesthood?
When I jumped out of the window, it was all gone.
Is he?
We got there.
They are children.
Let Nothing Deprive You of the Prize, Mr.
Don’t forget to carry a letter.
I know that he loves me.
There’s a way to get there.
I too am going to school.
I don’t have a brother.
I'd hit my finger with a finger.
What do you see?
It is shameful.
Where do you know?
Where is your father?
Don’t ask me again.
My father is not at home.
Sponges are booming.
The Japanese?
Leave a book.
You are a good person.
These windows close to the south.
I told them to buy bread for me.
I will walk in the day of God.
We can see.
Where do you come from?
I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.
I don’t know where to live.
There is a hundred people in the hall.
I understand that.
The owl has no teeth.
It was not.
My dream had come true.
You can understand me.
I don’t know what to say...
Where do you know?
I am not a university student.
Let me see.
Are you with us?
Do good to those who hate them.
No two souls are exactly alike.
It is too small.
The kidneys are not used today.
We are so happy.
The girl is pretty.
Come to see me.
I am not a good carpenter.
I don’t know.
Tell them what happened.
I thought you were going home.
I did it for you.
I love your car.
Who is your teacher?
Would You Welcome a Visit?
Does that prospect appeal to you?
They should.
There is no doubt about it.
Would I like to?
I’m not sure.
I’m glad you are there.
I need to be corrected.
I quit.
Do not resort to sarcasm, but judge by the motives of others.
I don’t know what to think about.
I do not know what to do.
What motivates people to do so?
Where am I?
Do you know his name?
Money ran out.
I want to buy a car.
I want to go too.
It’s not fair.
What will be your turn like?
We are happy for them.
Quite the contrary!
I lost my keys.
I never heard that word.
I don’t know you are here today.
I’m looking for you.
This house is my house.
Your car is a good one.
They say that he is very rich.
No one can be certain.
Do you travel or not?
We don’t go.
In the past, there was a temple here.
I know he had said.
Oh, thanks.
Why don’t you go home?
Is that how you feel?
They don’t give me a chance.
What would you like to see?
Why Do You Ask?
Here comes that dreamer!
They didn’t give me a happy day.
I believe he is very good at it.
Get what you want.
I know that girl.
It was not immortal.
You are a good parent.
Do you need a car?
I don’t have any money.
Do your homework.
I want to accompany you.
I only know his name.
Asa and his mother.
I’ll have a good time.
We discern.
What is the family like?
I speak a little Spanish.
Next!
How old is he?
I have to know why.
You are not my brother.
My family is young.
Does Tom know why?
Is he at home?
I like mathematics.
I know what to do.
No two souls are exactly alike.
Nothing will happen.
We meet one another.
Of course!
Where is Tom?
Do not be afraid.
Where did you get it?
I don’t know French.
When do you go?
They have no money.
Tell them what happened.
What is this phone number?
Resist self - blame.
It is not a horse.
Look at me!
Sooner or later, it will likely happen.
I can see them.
Are all travel adequate?
I don’t know you are here today.
He nodded.
Are you with us?
It is not presumptuous to think so.
Look up!
I love the car.
I know where to look.
Yours is like your A.
How much is enough?
Keep them in separate order.
There’s no way out!
Where would you like to live?
See.
No one really listened.
Don’t forget to carry a letter.
We are here for your sakes.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
Remove your shoes.
They know us.
When Do You Stand Up?
I will not turn my back on him.
From England.
Please, separate from me.
Let me explain.
Windows opened.
You do not have to come.
No one listened.
I never forgot it.
I don’t think he will.
There is no harm in doing so.
The rice is covered in this way.
I know exactly how it works.
No one asked.
They want us to do that.
What do you see outside?
I hope you are welcome to be happy.
I won’t be there.
Where is Tom?
What is French?
The owner of the literature is my sister.
We could take on work tomorrow.
We arrived.
I am learning French at home.
Thank you for listening.
I know where they’re going.
It is a marvel of creation.
Our equipment is fat.
I know your father.
“ I am learning French in school.
You have to leave your house.
Where have all the people gone?
Can You Open the Window?
Will you go there?
Where is my mother?
If not now, when?
What do you look for?
Where is your car?
My father was away.
There is no question about it.
Do you know what it is?
I am not left alone.
Are you looking for them here?
No rich man lived here.
The tip had to be sharp.
You know him.
I would be glad to see her.
My father was away from home.
Look!
What’s Wrong With This Phone?
You can sing.
Be deeply sorry!
I know how to do it very well.
We are hungry.
I thought you could understand them.
Where are we now?
Love fades.
Let me send it to you.
I know you’re right.
I don’t belong to him.
I’ll try it.
The strong winds blow, and I cannot move about quickly.
Probably not.
There my sister was.
I don’t give up.
How much time will you devote to it?
Asa and his Father.
What is that?
You have been killed.
My house of worship is adjacent to the church building.
He was an integrity keeper.
All the water that falls down will be eaten by pigs.
I couldn’t look.
I don’t want to read it.
No one knows his name.
Do you know where they were?
Where do you go to school?
Where?
What a thought!
She gave it to me.
I never saw him.
What is it?
Listen to us.
Why do people say that?
Past maps were immensely expensive.
I have made a sworn statement.
I don’t know French.
No one!
Why do I have to do that?
Saturday.
So I did that.
I am a cook.
How many?
We do not have the money.
I know that you listen to me.
Remove your sandals from off you.
I know exactly how you look.
I was happy.
A new car?
Why not?
She did not read the book.
I do not want to be rich.
Please forgive me, for I am speaking.
An ant does not raise its teeth.
This will be a cause for rejoicing.
You can attend.
When Do You Come Home?
She did not read the book.
You have to get up.
We love you.
This book is a new one.
You know him.
He is a Frenchman.
I don’t have a car.
Focus on your head.
Why not make it your aim to keep what you have in mind?
I want you to see her.
You can use this car.
No, it is not.
I am a teacher.
I love him.
I don’t belong to him.
Would you like to see this?
Not at all!
I love you.
He came alone.
I bought her eggs and eggs.
One papyrus was lost.
I saw her again.
Is this your mother?
We grew up together.
What was your purpose?
Are you looking for us?
I’ll be in my car.
I don’t like running.
He is a Frenchman.
He is a tall boy.
I know exactly how they look.
You know how to do this successfully.
I have a car.
When Will You Come to Your Home?
In the evening, between two and eight o’clock, it is a time of rejoicing.
You do not have to come anyway.
You have to quit drinking alcohol.
Be kind to your mother.
There’s a way to get there.
Where did you drive?
I can't guess between one hour and two hour.
If you have a speech impediment, kill it.
What should I wear or be put on?
What book is it?
The Americans?
What do they look like?
Look at me!
I’m reading a book.
Read!
I don’t know.
It is not as you think.
Would You Welcome a Visit?
Where Are Your Things?
An error is too great?
We drink.
Here comes that dreamer!
Never
I will step on such.
We are happy for them.
Keep your senses, be watchful.
It doesn’t show respect to me.
I take them.
I am not hungry.
I understand.
Not necessarily.
“ I am learning French in school.
Why?
I want to go home.
Asa and his mother.
Will You Look for Me?
Include your mother.
You know I have to go.
Which car?
Do you love him?
We must place an average between output and logs.
The serpent jumps on the cat.
They are not coming today.
Do You Know What You Are Asking?
Open the window!
Here’s our home!
This son is his brother.
Why didn’t you go to school?
Why don’t we go home?
Can I enter?
You know that I love you.
Researchers have found that the bones of a person have been found in a cave.
Our journey depends on time.
Can I see it again?
These steps can prevent the spread of metal.
I’m a refrigerator.
We are told to eat a meal together.
Do not be angry!
It is not a dialogue invitation. We're only going to a movie.
I loved him.
Why don’t we go home?
Get out of my room!
I am new here.
I want to learn French.
I will come and collect you.
I have a sister.
I slept on the floor.
I have a purse.
The waters began to abate.
I should have walked away.
I talk about what I think.
What Is the Cost?
I know where we are.
Why not?
I’m going to carry my car.
Why are you not in class?
We are students.
I do not know his name.
I’ll have a good night’s rest.
How are you going to school?
Forgive Me!
The Bible’s Viewpoint
Don’t tell me!
Do you know what it is?
Please forgive me, for I am speaking.
I know her family.
I know.
I lost my keys.
I believe this.
They don’t give me a chance.
What is your reason for your trip?
Why not?
She does not speak English.
The night before, I had eaten eggs.
Right, wrong?
We know him.
I want a little rest.
No one asked.
We are hungry.
I was devastated.
I talked to my parents about it.
I get up at two o’clock in the morning.
Do not open a window.
Let me explain.
Why Are You Not Here?
Why is it hot?
All day long, he is at work — at his feet — in spite of the rain.
It is up to us.
Do not look below.
How does she feel about her little sister?
Can we settle our differences amicably?
Where are we taking us?
I loved the car.
Why learn French?
I think so.
I shall see.
I know what you are listening to.
He blamed the man for his theft.
I did it myself.
I’m not sure.
I don’t know their names.
I support your goal.
I know what to do.
They say that he is very rich.
Your coat is dirty.
In Germany, are they not?
Do you love it?
"These trucks are popular?" – "My husband is my Father."
You do not need to thank me.
What happened the next evening?
We want them to carry them.
Asa and his mother.
In that case, we are sure to meet with a measure of happiness.
We came to see you.
Would you like to do so?
It’s not my car.
I do not know his name.
Do you want something to drink?
Do you not know what happened, or do you know?
I know what love is.
Not at all.
A rafter is in the hand of a commander.
What do you do here?
I’m a refrigerator.
No one prepared me.
We attended the same classroom.
Where?
It made me think.
Do you have any?
Is this the case?
We shall see.
We’re our siblings.
I know why you are here.
Why did you study at a university?
What is it?
Sooner or later, it will likely happen.
When does it come home?
I've broken your signature.
Of course.
Listen to your mother!
Please read on.
I will give it to you.
What news?
They come to my room!
A cup of tea?
Do you want something to drink?
I am the youngest.
How much is enough?
I would like to read this book.
Back in Brazil.
I am going my way to take you home.
We attended the same classroom.
Do not forget us!
I’ll write about it for us.
Do not give in to frustration.
Do you have this money?
Not too little.
It is his work.
That is what you have asked.
She’s my sister.
What do you want?
Do You Appreciate What You Have Received?
He was left alone.
I want to see.
Stop setting rules!
Sometimes we went to the movies.
You’re right, aren’t you?
Have you read this book?
When?
Why do we do that?
This is extremely long.
Do you believe that it does not matter to me?
Inside the cover are nettles.
She’s my sister.
It is his work.
Do you know what they said?
I’m not sure.
They do not know.
A American?
A cup or a cup?
What was at the bottom of the list?
My forgiveness is that I lost my job.
We are alone.
I love what I am doing.
My tone of voice was vulgar, and I had a filthy sense of humor.
Do you know what he said?
His voice was clear.
When do you want to go?
I don't understand such things.
Is it the best?
Are they also in Japan?
I’ll try.
Does he know that you love him?
We are losing precious time.
Why not quit?
Make an appropriate protocol without being distracted by other languages.
What is his family like?
Magdalena and Anita are good friends.
I am happy and joyful.
We should eat together during the day.
Give yourself a copy.
Do you have a brother or a sister?
We got together.
I’ll agree with that.
I have to think about it.
Where is Mary?
I was paralyzed.
I have to keep it.
I’m glad you are there.
Do you think you are happy?
Why don’t you be with me?
No one is at home.
I’m not sure.
He loved her.
She was barren.
Why Don’t They Love Me?
How Much Support?
What Did You Give Me?
Look outside.
Tom is a carpenter.
I am not a master.
His face is intense; the brow is furrowed in concentration.
It was not.
Return!
I’ll do that.
How many nights?
We will be able to do so.
I was greeted by people with warm, friendly smiling faces.
You have to leave.
Asa and his Father.
You are told to go with me.
Do you know where he lives?
I was not happy.
Why not accompany me?
Give me your hour.
Do you have my savings?
This is a very effective tool.
I thought you were going home.
I don’t have a brother.
I don’t know.
I don’t know how to keep it.
Can You Review?
I do.
Do you know these people?
Is this wrong?
Why do I work?
I am not ready.
This industry makes car machinery.
I don’t belong to him.
Yes, indeed.
Do not do it again.
Go into a window.
I was not happy.
One papyrus was lost.
Take money.
He is happy.
Driven by traffic.
Would you like to know why?
Would you like to examine that topic?
Remember your kindness and respect for others.
I am the youngest.
What do you think?
We like to have a talk in the language of the day.
So you have brought me to this place.
I’m not sure.
I did.
No one said a word.
We’re our siblings.
It is hot.
So I did that.
I have to learn.
Thank you very much!
Yes.
Does that sound appealing to you?
He is our neighbor.
For what purpose?
I have no one who's my neighbor.
We are students.
Nothing new.
Do You Know — Did You Come or Not?
Can you recount what you have said?
No one noticed.
I’ll try.
I want to ask you, are you left out?
I know that girl.
What kind of books do you like to read?
He needs water.
Where are you taken?
There is no harm in doing so.
It makes me feel good.
How many cups did you drink?
But where are these positions?
This car is good.
We listen to it.
Our equipment was exhausted.
We shall see.
What is your report?
I know you’re right.
Apologize for what you’re saying.
Children too.
I am a teacher.
We ascended a path that took us to the brow of a hill.
I can’t remember any names.
Do you want to be rich?
I would like to read this book.
I never lie.
I am a university student.
These are for us.
They do not want us to know.
It’s not my car.
You've got a red light sign.
I know what I have been told.
I miss you very much.
I listen to what you have to say.
I want you to stay.
Together we walk.
Create circumstances that promote study.
I am not good enough.
No one!
It is not a matter of feeling good about yourself.
Do you understand French?
He makes me think.
It’s on the front.
What is this wine?
I have a brother.
It is not a big investment in time.
If you need help, call me.
I too.
We got out.
Here no one is wealthy.
Why does he want to get there?
Listen to your mother!
I like mathematics.
Here comes that dreamer!
We are all going there.
Our next week.
I like to watch your cooking.
What do you do?
I shall lack nothing.
Do they too come?
You know that we love you.
You can separate the sheep from the goats.
I’ll think of that.
No one really listened.
I love learning French.
It is possible to enter the sea coast this seventh edge.
Why?
You don’t come, do you?
You have to leave.
How old is he?
I know you.
Never
She seems happy.
I know where to look.
All day long, he is at work — at his feet — except when the rain fails.
Thank you very much!
I do not want to.
What was at the bottom of the list?
I’ll see a movie.
It sounds so good.
I’m reading a book.
Do you know who that car is?
I shall lack nothing.
You are a good student.
Forget that.
I am sure that I saw her again.
Are You Too Late?
I have learned to pull my hair up.
Do you plan to attend a meeting?
I had a hard time coming to terms with my newfound beliefs.
Culture.
They do.
Return!

Forgive freely.
I don’t have a car.
You don’t come, do you?
He is happy.
Because I am in the wrong.
Do You Recall?
Awake!
No one knew what should be accomplished.
I saw them in different ways.
Did I quit?
Because I am in the wrong.
I want you to feel that way.
I can get to know the things I can bring.

I love to come here.
Have two windows of your own home?
I started working in this company for a year.
They are very tall.
I’ll agree with that.
Why do you feel that way?

I live in Norway.
I went to sleep all day long, for it was God's day.

You are my friend.
What kind of books do you like to read?
She was not a child.
Why do you go there?
I thought you were going home.

Do what you want.
You will come to love them.
She does not speak English.
The car breaks down.

Can I use it?
Too Long?
Did you notice them?
Do you know him?
They pay him not on the month but on the day.
Do you?
I am a Chinese woman.
The owner of the car was my father.
Thank you!
Asa and his mother.
We know him.

What do you think?
She was not a child.
No one knows where we are.
Probably not.

He does not love us.
It will be very good.
He is a Frenchman.

He got it.
Are you a student?
A Good Night!
I don’t know where they are.
Why Don’t You Go Home?
I thought I was living life to the full.
Well, I guess you know.

I have a sister.
We are not commanded to do so right now.
I know.

What’s Wrong With This Phone?
We know.
My father is not at home.

What was wrong with that?
I am on vacation.
You are sick, and you have to rest.
He eventually returned home with the money.
Lets resemble yellow.
There was no one except me.
I said that I was sorry.
I know what I’m saying.

A friend of mine has experienced something similar in the past week.
I am calling back home.
I’ll take them.
We’ll take a second step.
He loved her.
Where Is Your Brother?
You will not come, will you?
If he had stayed at home, there would have been no problems.

Is that how you feel?
You will love him.
I saw her.
That’s what I’m looking for.
Yes!
I am not good enough.
I’ll call the windows.
I’m not sure.

I have to rest.
I think so.
I’ve found one.
Make eye contact.
Why So Much Hate?
I read this book.
I’ve come to find you.

Remove your sandals from off you.

You are not my brother.
I’ll see it.

So that is what I have.
