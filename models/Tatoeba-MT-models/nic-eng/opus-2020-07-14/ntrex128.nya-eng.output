Legal House counselors are concerned with the matter of ‘ looking foolish'
There is a confusion between some Parliament’s counselors with the idea that their head should be changed to MWPs (member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has been due to the idea that the convention’s name was changed to the Parliament of Wales.
Parliament of various political parties are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
One member of the Labour Parliament said that his team was concerned that it might be "like Twp and Pwp".
To the foreign reader of Wales: In the Welsh language the tup means the first and the pwp means the clay.
One member of the Plaid Parliament said that the rest of the group was "not happy" and made other methods.
One of the Welsh Conservatives said that his team was "open to other ideas" at the transition of the name, but he realized that it was a short term from MWP to Muppert.
The Welsh w is also referred to in the name of the sign in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently making rules to establish the name, stated: "The final decision of the election of the House of Assembly is a matter to be considered by those members."
The Welsh Constitution of 2017 authorized the Welsh Parliament to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public investigations where it has been found that people agree to the idea of changing the name of the building into the Parliament of Wales.
In the case of the House - to - House Advisers, the Commission favored the name Welsh Parliament Meners or WMPs, but the MWP’s opinion had received a great deal of conviction in the discussion with the public.
AMs seems to make some decisions, but fighting to reach unity can be a major problem for Leader Elin Jones, who is expected to issue an uncertain law concerning the change within a few weeks.
The policy of this reform also includes other changes in the operation of the legal building, including legislation in exterminating the House of Commons and the design of the committee.
The members of the Parliament will receive the final vote on the question of what the building will be called after the legal discussion.
Macedonians undertake an election to change the world’s name
People will vote on Sunday to change their country's name into the Republic of North Macedonia.
A popular opinion was set up to deal with a long - standing conflict with neighboring Greece, with its territory in its territory called Macedonia.
Athens has been affirming that the name of the northerners sounds the meaning of the territory and has repeatedly refused to respond to an invitation to enter the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia Gjogen Ivanov, an antiprofitist, said that he would not vote.
However, those who want a name to be changed, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is a price to pay in EU and NATO
St. Martin’s St.
"From history, the adults with whom I spoke said there was a place of beer and a church," said my father Adams.
"Now, there's no such.."
He also said that the absence of alcoholic beverages would be understandable.
‘ People have different social networks ’ these days, he said.
"A drink is not in the dining rooms where people are frequently visited."
Concerning the congregations, they worry that the money to sell goods will not be as long as the authorities expect, "and they will soon return to where they started."
The churches, he said, could be replaced by tall buildings filled with people who would not help the nearby shrines, he said.
"Most of the people who will buy the houses built in these houses are white," he said, "and why they rush out the day when these congregations will be closed together because there is no doubt that the majority of those who move here will be members of these churches."
All of them were founded by the white congregation of Harlem before it became the city of the Black Metropolitan Community in 1870 and at the end of ten years in St.
The first Western Methodist congregation had departed in the 1930 ’ s.
A congregation of black people who were worshiping nearby seized the house.
St. Martin's was picked up by a black congregation under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the flow of sales on 125th Street, the main shopping road in Harlem, who refused to work or promote black people.
The fire in 1939 left the building in ruins, but after Father Johnson had planned to rebuild it, a number of benches were set up.
Pastor David Johnson, the son of Pope Johnson is also the next at St. Martin's, he proudly called the established bogs ‘ bogs of the poor.'
A specialist who listed flowers in July named another one: "Legative Riches" and "an unchangeable historical treasure."
Scholar Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also said that this was the first bell on earth to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had moved to the grand audience at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
A Merweather said that St. Martin's did not replace them.
What has happened in St. Martin's in recent months has been a matter of serious concern to architects and clinics, some of whom were brought along by the general leaders of the congregation, others by the Episcopal council.
A regular parish commission called the parish council, made up of general - written executives in July, is concerned that the council "needs regular church services to pay for the services; even though the churchgoers have not always participated in the work of the architects and mechanics whom the council sent to work.
Some of these churchgoers have always complained that the witch doctor is not doing anything in public.
Shark had injured a 13 - year - old child who was swimming in California
The Shaki was attacked and injured in a 13 - year - old boy on Saturday who was performing swimming in Callillonia on the first day of swimming, the authorities said.
The plot took place less than 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Ennitas.
Chad Hammel had told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was playing games with his friends about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then went up with a team to help him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first they thought I was merely holding a mouse, but then, "he realized that he was shouting, ‘ I’m thirsty!
I was hurt!'
The whole page began, "Hammel said he had recognized this as soon as he arrived with the boy.
"I call anyone to come out of the water: 'In the water you have a shark!' Hammel added.
The young man was taken by plane to the Free Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was registered on the side of the very sick.
The type of shark that had damaged him was unknown.
The Cantt. Larry Giles said that at a press conference the shark had been seen in this area a few weeks earlier, but it was proved that it was not of harmful nations.
Giles added that the victim had been seriously injured on the land.
Officials closed their way to people at the coast from Ponto Beach in Casabald to Swami of Onunitas for 48 hours to search for and create local security measures.
Giles says there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but many do not look frightening.
Sainsbury's wish to set up a fashion store at the UK
Sainbury's contest with other suppliers, such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, who have stores with beautiful sections and shelves that have other assistive professionals.
As a part of a UK model shop for $28bn, which continues to grow at the time when the clothing market and household goods are running back, a beautiful shop with holes was tested in 11 stores throughout the country and took it to other stores in the next year if they are going well.
The idea of getting into the fashion industry came about because supermarkets look for ways to use cables used on TV, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's said it could double the amount of makeup that will be given to 3,000, including in a country such as Revlon, Esie, Tweezman and Dr. Paw Paw for the first time.
Sales from L'Oral, Maybelline and Butt's Bees will also find many places with similar symptoms available in stores such as Boots.
This package also produces a home - sales Chop so that many items will be associated with people who do not eat the raw meat that young buyers so desperately need.
Additionally, Fragrance Shop's perfume vendor will try to sell two Sainbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, the second week and the second open at the White Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
Shopping on the Internet and changing the way to buy small food every day in nearby stores means that the markets must do much to attract people.
Mike Coupe, the head of Sainbury's, says that the market will seem to have sections of sections while this section has several branches to try to cope with Aldi’s already reducing prices and Lidl’s main supply of food.
Sainsbury's has been missing the Argos trading facilities in hundreds of stores and has established several public facilities since the time it bought two branches in the last two years, which says it has strengthened the sale of stores and made the market more profitable.
The recent attempts at the store to repair its art industry had failed.
Sainsbury's attempted to join the Boots in the early years of the 2000, the founders of this partnership had ended after a misunderstanding in which money could be distributed from the drug stores in its main supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury sold his 281 drug business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy’s drug dealing, for $125, three years ago.
Lloyd was also required to take part in this work, adding many kinds of skin care to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business managers at Sainbury, said: "We have changed our appearance and hearing of our beautiful openings to decorate the shopping facilities.
We have also spent much money on well - trained friends who will be available to help.
Our brands have been designed to meet every need and to find a beautiful place and a convenient location until they mean that we are now an interesting place that disagrees with the old method of buying."
Peter Jones was a 'grievous' due to the departure of Holly Willoughby in a multimillion - dollar partnership.
An expert at the Dragons Den Peter Jones was left 'resenting' because of the departure of TV producer Holly Willoughby on a financial partnership £11 million of her outstanding business to manage her new partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had no time to manage their Truly business to sell household clothing and other items.
The two businesses were likened to the Gwyneth Patrow of Goop.
The 37 - year - old announcer, This Morning, had gone to the Instram to announce that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dr. Peter Jones of Drgon Den’s technical skill angry because of leaving the bridery business with the last advantage - so as to manage her new partnership with Marks & Spencer and IPV.
According to the source, Jones ‘ was upset when this TV - made girl admitted to the difficult conference on Tuesday at the headquarters of Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new partnership has value of £1.5 million (U.S.) - has the claim that she had no time to manage her house trade and other things.
The business was compared with the Gwyneth Patrow business of Goop and was encouraged to acquire £11 million worth of Willoughby.
When Willoughby, a 37 - year - old, went to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to his vacation home.
The source said: "Truly was very important in what Holly puts first.
This was a long-term future for her to be useful for several decades to come.
His free thought left any involved in the shock.
No one can believe what was going on that Tuesday, which was about to be interpreted.
There is a warehouse full of goods that is ready to be sold at Marlow HQ.
Experts believe that from the founder of This Morning, a member of Britain’s most reliable technical team, it could cost the business millions of dollars because of being overloaded with such products as shelves and candles and household clothing, as well as the possibility of developing a business.
And it can mean the loss of a long - term friendship.
Wiloughby the mother of three children and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby and Cappp started Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, would compete as chairman in March.
The families have one vacation, and Jones has a 40 - percent portion in the Baldwin TV industry.
Willoughby serves as M&S General and will replace Ant McPartlin as an I TV guest on the Im A Celebrity program.
The well is near Jones at the end of the night, "We can't say anything about it."
The main issue was 'We’d love each other'.
He laughed at the criticism he received from the press because he gave some comments that he might consider "he is no leader" and that he was convinced of a North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such a great sacrifice?
Trump spoke in the words of his mocking "readers.
"I didn't give anything."
She also said that Kim wanted to attend the second meeting after her first convention in Singapore in June that Trump said it was a major nuclear assignment in North Korea.
But discussions on the prevention of nuclear weapons have been suspended.
More than three months after the June convention in Singapore, the general general of North Korea Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly last Saturday that North Korea does not see the "same" from the U.S. in terms of what North Korea originally did in launching arms.
On the contrary, the U.S. continues to offer forced punishment.
Trump looked forward to what he said at that convention.
"We’re doing well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war in North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.
He also pointed out that the efforts they made to build a good relationship with Kim have produced positive results in the testing of rockets, the release of prisoners, and the restoration of U.S. soldiers.
And she justified her strange course when talking about friendship with Kim.
"I’m easy to be president, but instead of being with 10,000 people outside trying to enter the stadium, we have about 200 people standing here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd that stood before him.
Tsunami and Waterfall in Indonesia — More and More
After the quake of Lombok, for example, foreign agencies were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had been affected, no world disaster was reported, since worldwide help was needed.
"Many times, unfortunately, they seem to do not ask for help from other countries, so it’s a little more difficult, "Sumung said.
It is not known whether these foreign workers would be allowed to work as a group in order to move to Palu.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for disaster management, says that Indonesian authorities are trying to check on the situation in Palu to see if international agencies are allowed to provide relief.
Despite many earthquakes that occur in Indonesia, the country is not well prepared for natural anger.
Despite the construction of tsunamis in Aceh, these buildings are unusual on some beaches.
The lack of a swan to warn people of a tsunami in Palu, though a warning had already been missed, would likely have contributed to the loss of life.
In times of drought, traveling between many islands in Indonesia is very difficult.
Natural disasters make traffic extremely difficult.
A hospital boat that had been laid at Lombok to cure victims of the earthquake is on their way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the point of the new disaster.
President Joko Windodo encouraged planning construction in Indonesia to become an important part of an election campaign, and he has contributed large sums of money on roads and railways
But a lack of funds has a big impact on the government’s decision that will be decided next year.
Joko too suffers from religious upheaval in Indonesia, where many Muslims have accepted the same view.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have left their homes, while Christian and Muslim terrorists fight on the streets, using saws, knives, arrows, and other useless weapons.

Chelsea leads only 1-0 at the end of the first section after she has broken the chain in 25 minutes through a Belgian specialist, Edin Hazard.
The player in front of the Chelsea y gave her Kovac and a belt in the middle of the yard and then turned and rushed to the area of Liverpool.

A 32 - year - old man is accused of murder by the police
A deadly study has been established after a woman’s body is found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44 - year - old woman was found at 7,55 a morning on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32 - year - old man was arrested for thinking that he had killed her.
The police have encouraged local people who see or hear anything to come.
Department Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The survey is at the beginning but I would ask anyone who was next to John Street Street in Birkenhead who had seen or heard anything questionable to talk to us.
I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who can take anything from dashcam pictures to talk to us because they can have the words needed for our research.'
The police prophet assures the woman who had been found to come from Birkenhead and was found inside the house.
This evening friends who believe that they know the woman come here to ask questions about where she has been found this morning.
The police are constantly on the move, so to speak, letting the relative of the deceased know how to contact them.
A bus driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his house but is told by the police that no one is allowed into or out of the house.
He could hardly believe what had just happened.
The residents are now told to take hours to be allowed back to their homes.
A policeman was heard telling a man that the whole area is being held as a crime area.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
He continued to say ‘ it’s too bad.'
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police cars were inside the garage outside.
Several officers were standing inside the courtyard to monitor the premises.
Anyone who is familiar with what happened is asked to send a message to DM @Mer PolCC, singing at 101 or talking with the Crimes secretly on 0800,55,11, by heading 247 of September 30.
Cromwell at the House of Commons is a final reminder beaten and ‘ trying to restructuring history'
The ban will be a poetic justice because of its destroying, such as that of Tabaran on much of England’s moral and religious practices by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the views of Pope Crick as "foolishness" and " tried to reverse history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of the images so that the issue of the Oliver Cromwell on the outskirts of the Westminster Royal.
Taking the picture of civil wars in England is not carried on or carried by Cromwell.
Perhaps this erring Cromwell would be offered as a sacrifice because of what Thomas’s grandfather did a century ago.
The beautiful Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and of one part of the history of a man who most believe I should still be interested.
A Goldsmith had told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps especially at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of legal freedom against outside pressure, in the case of the emperor.
No matter how far the issue is, the debate is ongoing.
The fact is that the conflicts of the 17th century have changed the development of our country, and Cromwell is a well - known figure who clings to one side of the territory.
What he did as Lord of Protection is also to celebrate and remember.
A Chinese farmer was bitten and killed by pigs
One farmer was bitten and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, named after his family name "Juaan," was found dead from a broken vein, filled with blood near the market in Guizhou, South China Morning Post said Sunday.
A pigsman is preparing to slaughter a vaccine on a pighouse on May 30, 2005 in English in the province of Quinghai, China.
She says that she had traveled with her cousin from the area next to Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
Early in the morning, her cousin found her dead, and she found the door to the nearby pigs ’ house open.
He said that there was a big pig in the house with blood in his mouth.
Legal studies confirmed that a pig of 550 acres [550 ha] killed the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were blood and spongy," the tail, called "Wu," he said, as explained Guiting Evening News.
Photos of security depicting Yuan are entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
An hour or so passed.
The pig that killed the man was not Yuan or his cousin.
The store manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed was protected for every male, while the police gathered the evidence at the site.
Yuan’s family and business executives are on a par with him to pay for his death.
Though relatively rare, reports of pests are available.
In 2016, pigs hurt their mother and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with a serious injury.
Ten years earlier, a 600 - size pig hit a Welsh farmer at his tractor until his wife threatened the pig.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not aggressive but their taste of blood can be like "a cause."
"It's fun.
Like children, they are curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You should give them due respect, "he did.
The remainder of the Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to the southwest of the US
As foretold, a storm named Rosa is weakened by drifting along the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa is bringing rains to north - north Mexico and southwest U.S.
Rosa had a wind of 85 mph, a 1-Wave, beginning at 5: 00 a.m. on Sunday, and was 22 miles 385 miles [885 km] west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a small tropical area is being developed in the Pacific Ocean and moving east to the West Coast in the U.S.A. as Rosa near Baja California on Monday while the storm surges to the northeast of the U.S.
Rosa will bring 10 tons of rain to some parts of Mexico Monday.
Later, the hot, humid heat closes with the icy wind is able to bring heavy rain to the south west during the coming days.
In that region, 1 to 4 rain clouds can cause flooding, transporting garbage and leaving the land in the wilderness.
The dense fog causes the rainfall to reach from 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit per hour, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Two to four inches [2 to 4 cm] of rain is expected to fall in the southwest, particularly in most of Arizona.
The effects of flooding may be caused by worsening rains in tropical weather.
It can be dangerous to travel in the wilderness because of the tropical rain.
Strong rain can turn rivers into mighty rivers with strong water and strong currents, bringing storm winds and dust.
A approaching wind will bring heavy rain to the coastal regions of Southern California.
More than half of honey can fall, which can cause small dirt and narrow roads.
This is the first rain in this region during its rainy season.
The hot, humid rain begins approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before rain spreads on Mondays and on Tuesdays.
Strong rains will flow on the Tuesday side at Four Corns and close down on Wednesday.
The climate of the Arctic climate will continue to be warmer, but the temperature will continue to rise.
This sometimes results in quite a change of temperature in just a few miles away.
There is a fine example of the variety of tropical diversity in different parts of the US on Sunday.
There are about 20 tropical differences between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the following few days, tropical heat is also trying to increase.
Most areas of Central and eastern US are expected to see from October and to spread to 50 degrees from the South Pole to other parts of the Northern Hemisphere.
New York City can attain up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C] on Tuesday, which may be about 10 degrees Fahrenheit [10 ° C] above the average.
Our long - term predictions indicate the greater potential for intense heat in eastern U.S.S in the first half of the month of October.
Over 20 million people have seen interviews in the case of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people have seen the six sets of television Brett Kavanaugh chosen at the Supreme Court give testimony to her Thursday and Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses her of the sexual abuse that was alleged in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political struggle continues, and the media are undermining the regular program in the final half of Fridays: an article designed by Sen Arizona Flake for the FBI to investigate for one week of these cases.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was convinced 100 percent that Kavanough had abused her and tried to strip her of her clothes from a high school party.
Kavanough, in kind evidence, said he had a 100 - percent conviction that this had not happened.
It seems that more than 20.4 million people like Niesen reported on Friday.
The company was counting the compulsive average on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Other numbers were not present at the other cassettes that demonstrated the program, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In fact, Nielsen often has difficulty finding a number of people who are seen in office.
To understand this, it is the size of a large audience like that of those who played soccer or the graduation program.
Fox News Chanel, with its TV spokesman in full agreement with the election of Kavanaghid, exceeded the total attendance and about 5,69 million viewers throughout the day of obedience, Nielssen did so.
ABC was the second and 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielssen.
The interest in the end of the matter kept getting stronger.
Flake was an important part of the program that took place on Friday.
When the central Republican Office announced her payment of Kavanough, she was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being shot by opposing parties while they wanted to take up a ride to the Council's Assembly.
He had stood his face looking down for a few minutes with shame at a CNN film producer.
"I’m standing here in front of you," said one woman.
‘ Do you think he is right in the world?
She was told, "You have power when most women are powerless."
Folake said that the office had given an announcement and said that before the passengers were closed, they would have much to say at a committee meeting.
The Internet and television were all present immediately during the following hours, while the Council of Justice had to vote to accept the election of the Cavanaugh of the whole Senate to vote.
However, Folake said that she would do this if she clearly understood what the FBI has produced in the case of the selected ones on the following week, as a few Democrats were encouraged.
Flake agreed briefly with her partner, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and several seconds, Folake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was strong, for it was evident that the Republicans could not have vote for Kavanough without investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate cases involving Kavanaugh.
Britain’s Prime Minister May has criticized opposers as a ‘ political sporting event ’ with the Bexit article

Explosion from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost parts of Mexico’s capital.
The World Safety Council warned Mexicans to avoid approaching the volcano on Saturdays after the eruption again in the valley and recorded 183 air and ash for 24 hours.
The organization was responsible for the rapid and rapid growth in the area.
Photos on film show a small amount of ash that accumulates in the car windows in Mexico City as Xhochimirilco.

The police fight against Catalonians before celebrating the election day
Six persons were imprisoned in Barcelona on Saturday to follow the debate between the anti - subversive and liberal police, and when thousands joined the debate on the holiday of the cataracts.
A group of anti-submarine anti-submarine opposers had thrown them with eggs and poured them into death paint, creating black and dusty clouds in the streets that often have visitors.
Violence again broke out with the police in the afternoon, using their staff to try to stop the war.
For several hours the independent independent groups chanting "Osisiba" have not encountered those of these opposing parties shouting, "Keep Living in Spain."
Fourteen persons had received medical treatment for minor injuries that had been wounded during the riot, local journalists said.
The threat of protection still exists in a self - confident area over a year after the election of one October 1 that was considered unacceptable by Madrid but was fascinated with the Catalan - independent movement.
The voters have chosen to be independent, even those who are opposed to independence do not come mainly to vote.
According to Catalan authorities nearly 1,000 people who had been wounded last year after the police tried to stop the election in the polling booth and start rioting.
The self - appointed groups set up camps and spent the rest of the night in order to stop opposers from acting out violence in behalf of the world’s police.
The exhibition was gone but had been forced to occur in another way.
Carris Termes, 68 years of age, who participates in these independent demonstrations, says that he no longer believes that Catalonia will gain independence.
"Last year we have been living in a very good time.
I saw my parents crying happily after the election, but now we’re back again, she said.
Although they did well if they succeeded in a little success in the elections of the areas of December last year, the independent independent groups in Catalan have been fighting for this year with their well - known leaders in private prisons or in prison waiting to be tried for a hearing because they permitted choice and proclaimed their rights.
Joan Puig, 42 - year - old mechanics who recorded these exhibitions with the police on their phone, said that the conflict was with politicians on every side.
‘ It’s too dangerous, ’ he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Jukkeras, one of the nine Catalonian leaders who had been imprisoned since the end of the past year, announced that they would participate in the tax collection of the Parliament’s members in Europe the following year.
‘ Being a voter in Europe is one of the best ways to strengthen the fight against democracy and to exploit others what we have seen happening in the Spanish government, ’ he said.
Londondry: A man imprisoned after renting a house and a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been locked up repeatedly in a Londonderry building.
This took place in Ballnagard Crescent Thursday at 19: 30 BST.
Det Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage had occurred at the gates and the house.
Then there is the possibility of being thrown into a car at a later time.
The Menga freed the Ragers team of 1-0 honors against Livingstone.
Dolly Menga’s first yoke had made Livingstone’s team successful.
The Lvingston team surprised the Ragers team and gave Steven Gerard a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox team.
Dolly Menga had made the Gary Holt team similar to the Irish team in the second section.
Gerard’s team still excels in the Premier League’s modern sport, and the coming Sunday comes to meet the Herats as the largest of all, which is followed by eight concerts.
Before this event, Ragers will play with Rapid Vienna in Europe the Fourth Year.
Livingston, which still contributes to the playing of the team to six games, and the director of the Holt has not been defeated since he replaced Keny Miler last month.
Livingston’s organization loses its opportunity against visitors
The Holt group must have been ahead before they broke the yoke, with their improved football training that presents problems to the Ragers team.
Scott Robinson had a chance but failed to stop in front of the gate, and later Alan Lithgow tried their way to meet Craig Halket’s head football near the gate.
Householders were content to allow the Ringers team to play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble with the filmmakers.
That is how an important yoke was made.
The Ragers team did the wrong and started a film and the Livingston team got a chance, while Declan Gallagher and Robinson handed a ball to each other and found Menga, who touched the ball between the box and found a hole.
At the same time, the Ragers ’ team kept the ball in good condition, but it was found that soccer bars were not easy to get into and that the yoke of Liam Kelly was not under attack.
This went on the second stage, even though Alfredo Morelos had shown a man to guard Kelly’s soccer.
Scott Pittman’s football was surrounded by the foot of the Roller Allan McGregor team and Lithgow was unable to find a grip on Livingstone’s team.
The ball entering the cross always enters the case of Livingston and is continually removed, while two petrono applications were rejected - after the mistakes Halket had done to Glenn Middleton who had replaced the other, and another error concerning playing ball.
Amazing's from Livingston team - according to one observer
Alaskadair Lamont of BBC Scotland, Tony Maccaroni Arena
A good game is the surprising results of the Livingston team.
For me, he has played a great deal, far better than we can hope for a successful success.
He did not change his performances and his players from time to time won the best of all teams, but a great respect must go to the Holts in the way he has helped the team since he arrived.
He had plenty of professional athletes.
The director of the team, Halket, was very helpful in this sporting event, encouraging well - prepared curtains, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall busy.
The Ragers team was not encouraged, however.
It was inferior to the standards they had at times followed by the guidance of Gerard.
Their final games were not good enough to try to stop the door-play team, and it is a surprise to the Rangerers team, which is located at the center of the history of the conflict.
Erdogan is warmly welcomed in Cologne
There was a smile and excitement on Saturday (September 29) that leaders of Turkey and Germany met at a breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with a view to restoring the brotherhood among the NATO members.
They argued about human rights, the freedom of the press, and the independence of Turkey.
Erdogan next went to Cologne to open a new cabinet.
It is home to most of the people of Turkey.
The police had cited reasons for protection in noting a mob of 25,000 assembled in front of a stadium, but many followers had come closer to see their president.
Hundreds of Eldogan - allied opponents also made their voices clear, condemning Erdogan’s views as well as the German viewpoint of the German colonial regime.
The exhibition of these two sections demonstrates the disparity of opinions on a stranger, as some in the German Turks consider him to be a hero and a tyrant who is cruel to others.

The Trump said of Kavanough's encounter, the atrocities, the anger of the Democratic Party
The "Vot of the Supreme Judge Kavanough is a protesting against the harsh and dangerous acts of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a conference in Wheeling, West Virginia.
The Trump says that Kavanough's "Vavanh had to deal with, cruelty, rage" of the Democracy party throughout its election.
Kavanaugh gave a testimony before Congress IV, who strongly and cruelly denied charges made by Christine Blesey Ford that she had been raped a few decades ago in her youth.
Ford also testified to his claim.
Saturday the president said that ‘ Americans have seen the art and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"Containing Justice Kavanaugh is a vote of one of the highest constitutional guarantees in our time, a judge with a fine reputation for helping people," told a group of his followers in West Virginia.
The president has mentioned the election of Kavangh when he speaks of the need for good departures of those who follow the Republican Party on central elections.
Five weeks before the single most important choice of our time will take place.
I’m not running, but I’m running too fast, she said.

Hundreds of people have died from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and this number is growing
A total of 384 people were killed, many of whom had been caught in the stormy seas, when a huge earthquake and tsunami took place on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palau Friday, where a hundred feet [6 m] high, a hundred feet [6 m] high, had broken the coast in the evening and washed many to death and destroyed everything in its path.
The ssunami had occurred back by a strong earthquake 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat began yesterday, people were still working on land and not running there, and they were affected," Sutopo Pzowu Nugroho, a prophet of the BNPB disaster relief operations in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami did not come alone, pulling cars, chains, houses, and carrying everything outside," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through the sea at the speed of 800 kph (47 mph) before reaching the shore.
Some people had climbed the tree to escape the tsunami and escaped, he said.
About 16,700 persons had been transferred to 24 locations in Palu.
Space photos produced by a disaster organization showed many homes and shops destroyed, damaged bridges and damaged by water - beset buckets.
Earthquakes still wreaked havoc on the coastal city of Saturday.
A few earthquakes were heard in the area 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Approachation of Technology (BPPT) also said that the power generated by a major nuclear quake was about 200 nuclear bombs that hit Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s location is located at the edge of a long, narrow harbor, and this has contributed to the spreading of the tsunami, as it did.
Nugroho described the destruction as “great ” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, markets and hotels fell.
The bodies of the victims were found hidden under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that injuries and damage can be serious along the coast of 300 miles [300 km] (190 m) to the north of Palu, the area called Dongilaa, which is close to the quake.
The means of communication were "experienced and not much about where things are" from Don’tillaa, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 residents living there," said the Red Cross, adding that their volunteers and volunteers are going to the affected areas.
"This is a problem already, but it can grow," he said.
On Saturday the council was severely criticized for not knowing that the tsunami had occurred in Palu, although the authorities said that the tide had come at the time the warning was given.
In an uncertain video shared on social media, the father can be heard on the roof of the house shouting warning people on the street while the tsunami is approaching.
A few minutes later the water wall fell on the beach, carrying homes and cars.
Reuters could not prove the video at that time.
Both the earthquake and the tsunami had caused widespread electricity to erode communication methods that made it difficult for governments to coordinate rescue operations.
Soldiers have started sending cargo planes and donated from Jakarta and other cities, but the authorities still need food and other necessities.
The city’s report had been opened to further relief efforts and to close up until October.
President Joko Windodo has to go to the rescue center on Sunday afternoons.
The number of Deaths and Tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It’s very scary.
As the workers from the World Vision from Don’tilla went successfully to Palu, where workers live in wooden bags set up on their office site, they arrived in damaged areas on their way, says Mr. Dosaba.
She told me she had seen so many damaged homes, she said.
I’m scared.
Even the relief teams were getting ready to offer assistance, some complained that foreign relief workers with extensive experience are being prevented from going to Palu.
According to Indonesia’s laws, money, contributions, and international workers start out as long as a disaster is said to be a national one.
This has not been by today’s standards.
"It is still a disaster of the province, ” said Aulia Ariani, Prophet of the Red Cross from Indonesia.
"As soon as the government says, "HAWEN., with the disaster of the world," we can ask for help from other countries but no such information has been given at this time."
The second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami, friends and brothers of the missing loved ones hoped to return as miracles that had never occurred in the history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was carried from the toilet.
On Sunday, the rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped in a garbage dump for two days by her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, a teacher of Indonesia’s national team at a parachute, had trained two of the missing athletes at an Asian game, which was completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those imprisoned at Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mrs. Mági.
"As big as a parachute, I have my anxiety," he said.
Gendon also reported that, a few hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Hotel had spread to a group of parachutists, he tried to send the WhastAp to the Palla players, who participate in the harbor festival.
Its messages, however, only set out one white mark, instead of two blue signals.
I think it means that the messages have not yet arrived," she said.

West: The singer whose name has been changed to Yahweh
A musician from the West changes his name to His Yes.
In addition to the change at Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "He is known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, had been called Yahweh for a time and used the name as the title of his eighth - grade head, which was released in June.
These changes come before they appear on Saturday on Good Live, where they are expected to produce their new granaries called Yandi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande at a presentation that ended up "on the basis of a disagreement," said the producer.
In addition to a summary of his work name, West said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the word used most frequently in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'nu,' West said in the beginning of this year, in discussing its English title and Big Boy.
"I am therefore with you, and I am with you, and you will die.
It had come from Kanye, that is, to Him alone, simply a reflection of our well - being, our faults, our frustrations, and our lot.
It is a very clear indication of who we are.
It is one of the best - known musicians who change the names.
Sean Combs is well known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has declared that he loves loving names like Love and Brothers Love.
A link with the ancient West, JAY-Z, also announced that his name can be called in line or without.
Mexican gods have vowed that they do not use a military force against civilians
A Mexican leader named Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed that he will not use an army to fight the civilian population toward the end of the 50th anniversary of the suicide of many students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatolco Plaza "You will never use the military to oppress the Mexicans."
The soldiers shot students at the peacefully sight of the stadium on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when guerrilla groups were established in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico to pay monthly fees to students and to open many private universities.
He also said that unemployment and lack of education are motivating young people to join a gang.
U.S. government to raise man - made machines
While China is growing in the fields of automated machines, the United States must raise the cost of research in this field, says a businessman and encourages the use of a device such as Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Many U.S. branches have been proposed to use this device, while the world is not in the process of AI.
In the meantime, China has begun its program last year: and by 2030 it will be the number 1 on the use of the flag.
"Explosion may be a good start, since all countries are far younger than the U.S., and we have to get more advanced jobs, ” says Lee.
The extra money may double the chance of a success of AI in the U.S., Lee told CNBC to talk to each other this week.
Lee, where she owns the book "AI Superpowes: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" is concluded this month by the Houston Mifflin Harbor, executive director of the Sivovation Ventures that has devoted a lot of money to research machines in China, Face+.
In the 1980s this senior was at the University of Carnegie Mellon to build a machine that won the victory of Othello and then became the head of the Master of Science in Microsoft and the head of the Google branch in China.
Lee was grateful for the establishment of the Defense Advents Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and wanted to know when the contest would also be held to help identify the following experts.
Researchers in the U.S. usually have to work hard to win government prizes, says Lee.
"It’s not China which takes educated people; but it’s companies, ” says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other companies have sent scholars from universities to work in parts of AI in recent years.
Lee says that a change of the methods of migration can also help the U.S. to strengthen his AI activities.
"I think those who have the degree of PD should be given a license to be born in America.
The Chinese had established its program of development in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China is the one who gives funds to different schools as well as to the public research organizations in the United States, but the education of China is limited, says Lee.
Early this year the Security Department has established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which has to include coworkers in companies and academics, and White House has announced the establishment of the Secret Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA has announced the production of $2 billion in AI Nt.
Concerning NSF, it still costs more than $100 million a year to research AI.
When the National Security Commission put $100 million marks on the component of the annual Human Machinery.
The Macedonians have given a hearing vote if it is necessary to change the country’s name
They cast the tract on Sunday in order to feel that it is necessary to change the name of the country, "Rebelc of North Macedonia" which may lead to the conflict between the world and Greece that has been forcing the country to be recognized as a member of the European Union and the NATO of the European Union.
Greece, with the district of Macedonia, says that the name of its northern neighbors has thus been denied registration to the Macedonians as a member of the NATO and the EU.
In June the governments of these countries agreed that Macedonians should change their name, but culturalists have rejected it as an insult to the culture and history of the great Macedonians.
President Gjogen Ivanov has said that he does not vote on the taxes and that the majority of people do not vote has put the risk of having less than half the population can afford to be approved.
The question in the opinion vote was: ‘ Do you want to be a member of the NATO and EU in accordance with our relationship with Greece?'
Those who agree to change the name as prime minister of Zoran Zaev have demonstrated that it is a very difficult thing to do but that it should be allowed to become member of the EU and NATO organization, as well as to leave the country of Yugoslavia.
"I came to vote for the future of our country, the future of the Macedonian youth to be free as members of the European Union, because this means that all people will live without fear," said Olivera Georgijvka, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it is illegal to do so, many law - enforcement agencies have claimed that they have cooperated with the outcome of the election in order to achieve favorable publicity.
This change in name will require two thirds of the council’s counsel.
The National Legislative Council stated that there were no difficulties at 1 o’clock in the afternoon.
However, the votes were 16 percent, compared with 34 percent of the decisions of the 2016 legislature to vote.
"I came to vote for my children, both of us and of Europe," said 62 - year - old Gjose Tanevski in the capital city, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, Zorica and their son Dushko voted in Macedonia for the national name that would open the door to NATO and European Union in Stumucica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018
In the city of Skopje, 54 - year - old Vladimir Kavardkov builds a small structure and keeps seats in front of the tent set up and which will leave no election.
"We want to become members of NATO and EU members, but we want to join these organizations with a clear mind, not by force, as Kavarkov said.
"We are poor, but we have respect.
If they do not want us to become members like Macedonians, we may be able to register members of such organizations as Russia and China as the Euro-Assian Society.
Zaev, the prime minister, offered to promote trade in Macedonia, which is also a small number of people.
"I believe there will be a lot of prejudice because more than 80 percent of our citizens love EU and NATO," said Zaev.
He said that the vote for "that" would be "we're going to be our future."
The Council that was broadcast to Monday by the Macedonian Research Association's Institute for Policy Research indicated that some 30 to 43 percent of the population will participate in the decision - by a minimum number of potential visitors.
A Telma film executive pointed out that 57 percent of the people with whom the film’s reporters made a contribution to the Church.
The 70 percent of those polled said that they would vote in agreement to change the country’s name.
These decisions require 50 percent of the voters, including a single vote.
Rejection of this idea is the first step toward a European government - sponsored agency to take over the leadership of the world last May.
view: The Manchester City athlete, Sergio Aguero, past the Brigton team to drink the yoke
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed behind the Brigton team where Manchester City won 2 by 2 to 0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The Ague acted as if it were easy when it had been swallowed in 65 minutes.
In the center of the stadium, Argentina’s leading performers received a soccer match.
She ran right in front of me and gave me a chance.
The Aguero then met four Brigton athletes.
He then raced on one stern guard and raced more than the other deck and entered the box box at the Brignton team.
Then he handed the ball to Sterling, who was on his left.
The English actor struck the ball one time and gave him back Aguero, his forearmed the ball on a cart to the right of Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero suffers from pain on his feet," Pep Guardola, senior teacher of the Machesster City team, said to journalists.
"We said he played 55 or 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We had opportunity to find a yoke at that time.
But it was Sterling that gave the team the opportunity to win the lottery.
Its load came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received a ball in the Brigton team.
Then he gave Leroy Sane a good football.
Sena won the ball a couple of times and handed it to Sterling to her in charge of the game.
Sterling simply pushed the ball in a coil just about to jump off the line.
The Manchester City team is playing with the Hoffenheim team in the European Champions League team at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon in the stadium of Sinheim, Germany.
Schcherzer wants a special drama with Rockies
When the Nationals team was released from the scene of the slaughter, there was no need to introduce other games.
But Schezer, who pursues sports, wants to play on Sunday and the Colorado Rockies team, unless there is a policy for the outcome of the games to have a part in the Rockies, taking the lead in comparison with the Los Angeles Didgers’s team at NL West.
The Rockies team won 5-2 games with the Nationals Friday night team, but it is still eager to win their first slip.
"Although we can't find anything on these games, we will go into the stadium to know that the mob in Denver and the team will give us the largest game I can play this year.
So why don't I want to play such games?'
The National Association did not announce the beginning of Sunday, but it seems that he was intending to produce Scherzer to play the game first.
Scherzer, who will be playing 34 times in the first grade, has made plans for baseball on Thursdays and has been playing on Sunday after a full day of rest.
Washngton's player has 18-7 bridles in the 2.53 ERA and has played 300 footballs and 220 games in two stages in this box.
Trump conventions in West Virginia
The president has mentioned the election of Kavangh when he speaks of the need for good departures of those who follow the Republican Party on central elections.
All that we did was face - to - face with the threat in November.
Five weeks before the single most important choice of our time will take place.
This is one of the mains, -- I am not running but so fast that I am everywhere to fight the right choice, ” he said.
Trump continued, "You see a dangerous, frightening group of Democrats, seeing what is happening right now.
And he is determined to restore power by using whatever means are needed, seeing the challenges, the ones causing.
He does not care about those who hurt him, who have to cross to get strength and correct them, what he requires and what he needs, and we do not give them."
The Democrat Party, he said, is intent on "suspending and restricting."
"And you have seen this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats“ angry and mean but afraid and not telling the truth."
He has also mentioned the name of the director of the Senate Committee, Dianne Feinstein in the Democtrat Party, which has been adopted with derogatory terms from the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you release the document?
Oh, how do you feel?
No, I wait together - that was the most horrible physical language I’ve ever seen in my own body."
Labour too is a large congregation.
He lets no one say when it comes to his heart
When the promoters of the Momentum on my team decided to rebuke me, it was not surprising.
Besides, I am the last of the AVor Ps is told that we are not welcome all of this because of our communication.
My friend of Joan Ryan’s legal house was also treated in the same way because he opposed religious opposition.
To me, the examiner reproved me for not cooperating with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the need for reliable economic policies, national security, Europe, matters that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Friday Meeting of the Notingham East Labor Programme is "We want the meetings to be practical and beneficial to the minds of others.
For eight years of my life as the MP of the Abour movement, the Friday night GC meetings had been the same.
Sad to say today, not many conventions were held and the promise of political action in the way "good, mild" has already been abandoned and if this has already happened, it has already happened.
It also seems that differing views are not allowed in the Labor and aberration movement is defined on the titled and accredited to the parity bridge.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, as my friends I thought I would have political ties expected me to change and live in a place I did not agree with — either on the national security or on the EU's one market.
I will always speak freely - and do nothing to say, and there is nothing to do with the persecution of the social media that they want me to avoid, to criticize local politics, to tell me not to become a member of the Labor Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
True, I know that I have more privileges than some of my peers, such as comments that they have explained to me politics.
I am impressed by the skills and devotion of my peers who are daily in the face of pornography and prejudice but who are not ashamed of it.
One of the most disturbing features of our time is how cruel cruel the news is.
The last Sabbath, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labor movement should follow a tradition of caring for others.
The truth is that we are no longer a large congregation and that it is "no longer self-consolving" or a change of policy is reduced.
I have been a very active partner for the last two years when I have been encouraged to drop my head, lose my speaking ability, and become a ‘ good man. ’
But that is no reason why I became involved in politics.
Since I have won the Labor Organization 32 years ago as a student, when I have been irritated by the government of Thancher who left my whole class in a very fallen school, I have tried to encourage the good work of the government to those in their interests, either as a house secretary or a government official.
I have never concealed my political goals, including these past choices.
No one in the Nottingham East could be affected in any way by my opinions and issues that I would not agree with this new leadership.
For all of them, I would say that as the country enters the Bexit that will harm families, businesses and government services, I do not understand my intention to waste time and energy by being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An unexploded Ayr’s team comes to the top
The two ends have changed the outcome of the games, but it is not surprising that Ayr has to win the thrills of the Tenend Games.
Ayr is at the top, and it is the only team that has not reached in ten history.
Finally, it was a well - equipped game behind the team that had a good effect on the team because its players did not take advantage of the few moments these gave to the team’s teacher, Peter Murche.
"We’ve been going through a tough history but have never failed, so I should be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie a Melrose said: "Let's go to the Ayr team, they made better use of their opportunities than we do."
The chance to find Grant Anderson in 14 minutes was used by Frazier Climo, who led the Ayr team, but a fifth document received by Roy Hughes of Scotland, caused the Melrose team to lower the yokes through Jason Baggot.
Climo added the Ayr team by means of a pennote and replaced the first section before the Ayr team was to lead 17 to 5.
But the Melrose team started off well into the second stage, and the chance that it had won for Patrick Anderson was put to good use by Baggot, who recognized the slightest movement to be reduced to 5.
Later, because of Ruaridh Knott’s injury, which was carried on the roof, the acrobatic by Ayr added the bondage to the Clamo by means of the opportunity prepared by Stafford McDowall.
The Ayr team’s assistant, Blair Macpherson, also received a yellow document and was released, and Melrose took advantage of the increase and tried to throw on Bruce Colvine by pushing the Ayr team.
The board at the entrance also collapsed, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow document to fall on Clamo without a ball, on the penote, MacPerson resigned from the Ayr team.
Clamo followed the return of the soccer team, and this happened when Kyle Rowe fought in a box to give Gregory Henry a fifth chance of his team.
Still Game artist is expected to establish a new project in the private industry.
Skilled artist Still Game Ford Kieran is expected to establish a new project in the host companies after they are known to have been appointed the director of the food industry with the license.
56 - year - old Jack Jarvis plays on a popular BBC show, which he writes and plays with a long - term friend, Greg Hefill.
The two had announced that the ninth and last segment of the show was coming, and it seems that Kiernan is preparing for life after Craiign.
According to a list of approved companies, he is the director of the Adriftmorn Limed.
The athlete refused to respond to the matter, although the source of the Scottish Sun also said that Kiernan wanted to participate in "the best - selling food market in Glasgow."
'Let the sea be ours: Bolivian country at the other end of the sea waiting for the courts to return to the Pacific
Mariners charge the military headquarters of La Paz.
Public buildings advertise the flag.
The water camps from the lake of Titicaca to the Amazon contain the words: "The sea is our right.
For it to be our responsibility.."
Whereas Bolivia is far from sea, the memory of the Chilean coast in the 20th century’s bloody war is still well - known — such as the yearning to sail again in the Pacific.
That hope may have been even greater for decades now, while Bolivia is awaiting a five - year court hearing on October 1.
"Vali has power, a spirit of unity and peace, and has a high hope and confidence in its outcome," says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia’s deputy governor.
Most of Bolivia’s inhabitants will see the ICJ’s decision in the country’s largest exhibition, I believe that the Hague Court supports what it says that after many years of properly discussing Chile would have to do with Bolivia’s coastal areas.
Evo Morales, a prominent president in Bolivia, is experiencing a difficult civil war in the next year and with many expectations on the Monday decision.
"We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some experts believe that the court will not judge against Bolivia - and that small cases may change if it does.
The UN from the Netherlands has no power to assign the Chilean section, and it has said that it does not know the results of any conversation.
That the ICJ decision comes only six months after the final hearing shows that the case was “not a serious problem, ” said Paz Zárate, a French expert on legal matters.
In addition to advancing Bolivia’s goal, the last four years may have brought it back to the country.
"The case to sea has been taken by Bolivia’s authorities here," said Zárate.
Morales ’ harsh speeches have ruined all the good things that remain in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to communicate, but that may be difficult after the discussion.
These two countries have not served as ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that these decisions acted with incredible urgency.
The letter will bring to Bolivia "the best opportunity to have a new relationship with Chile" and also the opportunity to“ finish 139 years of misunderstandings and meaningful relationships," said.
Calzadilla also argued that Morales - one of the most prominent presidents of Latin America - used sea history as a political policy.
" Bolivia will not leave their freedom to go to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to cope with the past."
Northern Korea says that he will not destroy nuclear weapons unless he believes in the US
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that their country will not destroy their nuclear weapons for the first time if they cannot trust Washington.
It is said this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
She asked the United States to keep her promise at the Singapore conference between the leaders of two countries.
His words come after the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompoo seem to be about to resume three months of nuclear negotiations that were not successful at the Singapore conference by Kim Jon Un from North Korea.
It is said to be a ‘ dream ’ that continued economic sanctions as well as the U.S. refusal to announce the end of the Korean war will lead to the death of the North.
Washington does not want that announcement before Pyongang did destroy weapons.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump need a second meeting.
But there is no doubt that Pyonganga has been determined to give up weapons that the country considers to be the only means of protection.
Pompoo is preparing to go to Pyonganga the next month to prepare for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.

John Edward: The ability to speak different languages is a requirement for all the peoples of the earth
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent reputation for education, and this has continued in 2018 with good results, which are based on encouragement and success in sports, art, music, and so on.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are endeavoring to provide the best help for children and their parents.
Housebound schools endeavor to prepare their students for higher education, their choice of employment, and their place in the world.
As an educational field capable of establishing and establishing school curriculums, we see modern languages continuing as more and more subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela says: “When you speak to my father in the language that he understands, it’s just his head.
If you talk to him in his language, his heart is touched.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when it comes to forming strong ties and friendships with people from other countries.
From the results of recent tests of this year, we can see that languages are being learned by many people but are far superior in independent schools.
About 68 percent of the students who had learned foreign languages had done well and had obtained special results from class A.
Most of these, gathered in 74 schools of SCIS members, showed that 72 percent of the students had been able to achieve the high grades of the Mandarin class, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent of Spanish students had also obtained results.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland are helping with the study of foreign languages as needed skills that children and young people will no doubt want in the future.
Languages now, as a chosen theme, are being done the same in the sciences of STEM (science, mathematics, engineering and mathematics) in private and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Emploment and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons fellow employees, it was difficult to find people who are able to do the work, 17 percent say there is a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are needed to prepare young ones for the work ahead.
Since most of the opportunities for work are open to the language, these skills are needed in the world.
Regardless of a person’s choice, learning a second language will give him the opportunity to gain that kind of life - style.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign land places places a person of many different languages ahead of him.
According to the UK peak of over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of them do not speak a foreign language enough to communicate well and is the only language spoken by a population of 2 percent, 15 percent.
That is why putting money into a system to teach the language is now a requirement for children today.
Having several languages, especially those in the developing world, will help children to get a good job.
In Scotland each school had its own language.
Several schools will focus more on modern languages, while others will teach languages that seem especially useful to the UK in preparation for the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that you can choose in private schools, that are the experts in these areas.
Self - confidence Schools in Scottish are dedicated to developing methods of learning in preparation for children and to give them the skills they may need to succeed, even whatever may happen in the future.
It is still not available in the international business world, so that languages continue to be of great importance in the future of the world, why these are to be shown in education.
True, modern languages should be viewed as “a worldwide art. ”
Vocational schools continue to offer free rein, expand, and improve children’s lives.
It's hard to talk about.

The first appearance of LeBron at the Lakers Sunday team in San Diego
The wait is almost the end of the pictures in hopes of seeing LeBron James begin playing in Los Angeles Lakes.
Lakers ’ teacher Luke Walton has announced that James should play the first game in preparation for Sunday mornings against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes go by without knowing what to wear!
"More than one and at least 48," says Walton on Lakers Web site.
Lakers Mike Trudell wrote that James may be able to play for a few minutes.
Following the first exercise this week, James was asked what he wanted to do about the six - game schedule that he was preparing for Lakers dishes.
"I don't want a game ready for this time to be prepared," he said.
Trump convention in West Virginia Virginia, Yo Tube Chantel
Donald Trump, president of the Royal Society, has been holding meetings that night in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is one of the five Trump resolutions of the week, including standing meetings as in the area of Tennessee and Mississippi.
When the decision to prove who was appointed to be a judge in the Supreme Court was suspended, Trump wanted to appeal to the central taxes of his government while his Republican party was at the risk of being seized by the authority in the federal court on the orders of November.
What is the occasion, and how can you find it on your Web site?
That meeting was held at 7: 00 p.m., Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see this on your Web site, www.jw.org.
Trump must speak on the case of the Brett Kavanoughs who were appointed judges of the Supreme Court, which provoked anger because it relates to the fact that the Kavanaughs are thought to be clinging when a decisive vote has now been stopped for a week while the FBI are doing research.
The main purpose of the conventions, however, is to assist the Republican organization to benefit from the November tax flow.
Thus, the aim of the five Trump conventions is "to encourage our followers and people who want to be well liked when the Republican party wants to protect and increase the number of their counselors in the law building," according to Reuters newspaper reports.
"The presence of a number of counselors is the most important thing that has caused the presidents to hold these meetings in many places as we go to social conferences," one of the organizers who was not interested in choosing Trumps who did not want to be mentioned. She told Reuters.
The convention held at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling can be invited by our followers from Ohio and Pennsylvania and is distributed by the Pittsburgh executive, according to West Virginia Metro.
Saturday is the second time last month that Trump is on the path to Virginia City, which he won by 40 percent each vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the representative of the Republican party in West Virginia by Patrick Morrisey, who still remains in taxes.
"Preparation on tax collectors and presidents does not give a good picture to Morrison," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters reports.
Subject: The USA’s Best Act to keep up with the progress of the Sunday games.
When playing three games, four - person dramas on Saturdays can be the ideal ones for Ryder’s tier.
Changes are made in sports, but it is something that players especially believe in such contests.
Who, then, is to have the opportunity now?
"They led the 6 points, but now only 4 points, so we do it as a chance," says Jordan Spieth as he walks gently.
A European team has a chance and a set of 4 points while the 12 are still playing.
The American team, as told by Spiieth, feels that it has much to offer them encouragement, such as the success of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and all found three points in four pockets.
Spieth has been an outstanding example of one who has grown up to be successful in this regard.
As he and Thomas stayed in the noise, it became clear how the ball they hit fell into a hole, so that history would be comparable to four points.
His attempts to cast the ball into the hole were over the 15th floor, and so did people, which is a sign of his belief that the U.S. team had not been in full submission.
"You’re just having to wear hard and think about your sports," says Spieth.
This is what all the athletes have here.
Only 18 seconds later, the team sets out.
The winners of the winners of Spieth and Thomas on these two days are Frascesco millari and Tommy Fleetwood, still in the Ryder cup.
The two favorite European athletes have won four fourths, and they are perfectly free.
The "Moliwood" was the only two players who did not play ball around the hole on Saturday afternoon, and on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the end.
This, along with their encouragement and encouragement, suggest that the team is more likely to win the battle for the Church, and no players in Europe can win the European team after the sun sets in the Golf National.
They may even be on separate tracks.
It is still practicable to say that the European team has taken up the cup, while it is still here.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson easily conquered Sergio Garcia, who was a team and Alex Noren at four soccer games in the morning.
Getting the ball into a nearby hole and dropping it twice in the first nine lines led their team so that Spanish and Sweden scholars were unable to recover.
But the Church is not responsible for its success.
Four football games and four people are thrilled to watch close - ups because of two groups ’ conversations, the guidance given, the direction given, the direction given, and the change in entertainment.
In the meantime the European team has successfully played its team and is on its way to the final ideal but the four have shown that the American team has the highest potential, which is particularly the U.S.A.
The European team will lead 10-6 points on the last day of the Ryder Cup
The European team will be privileged to play the final Ryder team after winning the U.S. team in four games on Saturdays and 10-6 players.
Two spirit - inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari directed a team that had a lot of difficulty playing with Tiger Woods, whose success in playing games at the U.S.
A European team trained by Thomas Bjorn, under the leadership of Thomas Bjorn, was about to retrieve a cup that had been refused to defend it at Hazeltine two years ago, enclosing an American team at their four early soccer matches, on a 31 show.
The U.S. team had won the same match, but it had not been successfully completed.
The team trained by Jim Furyk requires eight points of 12 Sunday games to win a cup.
Fleetwood and the first European athletes who play the game for the first four points in a row and with their best performance at the end of the week, she and the beloved Molinari are called "Melliwood" and the second two players in the first four games in the history of the Ryder.
After the cruel defeat of Woods and Patrick Reed in the four soccer matches, Woods and Bryson Dechambiau won first prize in the U.S. team for the best 5 and 4 points.
Woods, who tried to do it during the two weekend games, had occasionally shown a man, but in the meantime he gave up 19 games of 29 soccer games with four players and seven pairs of games.
Justin Rose, who was released at four early soccer games, later organized a team of two and Henrik Stenson in four games and won 2 and 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka -o one of the first in the world.
On a cold day on the southeastern corner of Paris, the European team did not pass through the open air.
Jordan Spieth, who won three times with Justin Thomas, led the American team and two points on Saturdays.
They won 2 and 1 points above the Jon-Rahm and Ian Poulter in a team of four football competitions and also won the Pulter and Rotry Mcllroy 4 and 3 in a competition of four people even won their first two games.
In the history of Ryder’s cypress, only twice that the team left with four players in a unique sport has won, even though the Furyk security team needs only the strength of the other team to win.
If the second team went well for two days, the higher the performance on Sunday seemed much easier.
North Korea said that there is no reason to stop using its weapons without confidence
On Saturday, the North Korea minister told the United Nations that the continued ban on the U.S. government was a growing lack of confidence and there was no reason for his country to give up the use of nuclear weapons in that period.
RI Yong Ho stated at the UN annual Conference that the North Korea had done things like "significant defeat" last year, as not to stop testing their nuclear weapons and bombs, destroying the nuclear plant and promising no more nuclear weapons.
"But we never saw America doing the same things again," he said.
"If we don't trust the U.S. nation we will not be satisfied with the security of our country and in these things we cannot begin to stop using only nuclear weapons."
Even Ri repeats the Northern Korea complaint against refusing to stop the nuclear use of the U.S. nation in which North Korea was to be praised for its significant role in the event, as its country did not just refuse to stop the nuclear use as Pyong did in the past.
He quoted Kim Jong Un and Trump’s first president of the United States and North Korea president of the United States on June 12, when Kim promised to try ‘ stop using nuclear weapons on the Korean island ’ and the Trump stressed protection to North Korea.
North Korea has been hoping to end the war between North Korea and South Korea, but North Korea has declared that North Korea has abandoned nuclear arms.
The United States has refused to curb the harsher sentence of North Korea.
"The United States is becoming "the first nuclear stop" and has been adding ways to prevent North Korea from influencing North Korea, and the United States has also refused to“ announce the end of war, ” says R.
“ The idea that punishment is due to harm is nothing more than the wishful thinking of those who know us better.
The problem is that our lack of self - worth is coming from our lack of satisfaction.'
There is no mention of Kim and Trump’s second president to the United Nations conference at the beginning of this week.
Rather, the minister spoke of the nuclear environment of Kim and the South Korean president of Maon Jae in the past five months and added: "If the nuclear disarmament had been between us and South America it would not have been a matter of non-arming in Korea, it would not have been to the same degree."
Even so, Ri’s speech was different from those of the previous year in which he spoke to a U.N. when he told them that it was easy to direct the American regions with North Korea weapons when the "Black President" Trump called Kim "expert" at an empty meeting.
This year at the United Nations Conference, the Trumps, who had threatened to ‘ destroy ’ North Korea, praised Kim in the first act of disarmament, but said that a great work had to be done and the courts of North Korea still had to be used to stop using these weapons.
On the third day, Trump said he did not set limits on time, and he said, "It takes two years, three years, or five months to be out of work."
Both China and Russia urged the UN Security Committee to respect North Korea for its methods.
However, U.S. General Mike Pompoo told the Fourth Security Committee: "The punishments from the North Korean Security Committee were to continue and they are sure we will see that the country has ceased to use these weapons."
The Committee has been increasing the safety measures of North Korea since 2006 to prevent nuclear and other nuclear weapons deposits from being introduced by North Korea.
Pompeii met Ri at the United Nations General Assembly and said that he would go to North Korea the following month to organize the second party of Trump and Kim.
Pompey had journeyed to North Korea three times this year, but his final trip took a bad turn.
They came from North Korea saying that the discussions were successful, but a few hours later the North Korea contended with him, saying that he gave the "translatation."
North Korea has promised to meet the Moon this month to destroy the nuclear plant and the arsenal if the U.S. nation can do the same.
Kim, they claimed, told them that the ‘ same things ’ she wanted were the guarantee of security that the Trump had promised in Singapore as well as the steps to repair the relationship with the United States.
Harvard university students are learning a lesson about getting enough sleep
The new study at Harvard University that started this year has led college students to get enough sleep to end the night reading process by means of sleep control.'
One scholar found that the students of this world high school do not have the skills to look after themselves.
Professor Charles Czeisler, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in Brigham and Mother’s medical studies, conducted what he believed to be the first study in American history.
He encouraged the student to start the study as soon as he finished teaching about the consequences of a lack of sleep.
'When I finished school one girl found me and told me: 'Why are I told this in my last year'?'
He said that no one told him about the importance of sleep - what surprised me, she told the Telegraph.
The preceding year’s study of the need for proper sleep is presented in both education and play, as well as in health care.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Head of the Center for Health, said that the university had decided to start the study after finding that many students do not sleep particularly during the week.
There are different kinds of conversations during this one - hour study.
In one section there is a picture of the dot, where students wear a cup of coffee, tea, teachers, and books to tell them about the dangers of sleep and the quality of exercise, and the need for sleep.
On the other hand, students are told that how sleep deprivation often increases the risk of heart disease, depression, and cancer.
The school’s table has been used to encourage students to focus on their daily activities.
'We know that it does not change the behavior of students here.
But we believe he has the right to know - as well as the right to know the dangers of smoking, said Professor Czeisler.
The proud attitude of learning 'the whole night, he said, added that new skills and shared education add to the students' sleeplessness.
To make sure that you are getting enough sleep, and a good way to be a student’s ‘ secret drug ’ of coping with discouragement, fatigue, and anxiety, she also has to avoid obesity, since lack of sleep causes the brain to lose its appetite, and it often causes hunger.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old technical student from California, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the study because he learned one of the lessons taught by the professor in his first year at Harvard University.
She said that the study had opened her eyes and encouraged her to encourage the teacher to reach out to everyone in the university.
As a result, he requires all high - grade students to be re-schooled, such as these before the university was started.
Professor Czeisler demanded that students set a time limit for their watch to remind them of when to sleep, when to get up, and to know the dangers of light coming on the telephone, the map, and the electric light that interrupts a person’s sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Ranges: Menga Prison led to Gerard’s defeat
The Ragers team also gave in to the movement when the Dolly Menga led the Strard team, which appeared to be incompetent, to surrender to 1-0 in front of Livingston.
The Ibrox team appears to have been the first footing from February when it won 4 1 knobs before the St Johnstone team, but the team trained by Gary Holt won the Gerard team a second time in 18 games since teaching footballs will allow us to remain eight points on the top of the Heart.
Menga was sealed seven minutes in the first stage and the Ringers team that is missing is not seen and was able to return.
When the Ragers team falls on a series of six - dimensional history, Livingston’s team has risen to the third and is just behind Hibernian.
And there may also be problems that will happen to the Ragers team when the assistant of the Calum Spece was helped by the doctors because of injuries in the head with an object that is thought to have been dropped from the end.
Gerard turned eight athletes who won Ayr’s team into an ice cap like Betfred.
When the Holt did not change the athletes who played the same game as the Hearts played last week and must have been glad that his team played the Ragers team.
Ragers ’ team kept the ball in good condition, while Livingston’s ball - control team did.
And they had to lose it for the first two minutes when Menga gave Scott Pittman a good ball to play on the site where Allan McGregor was in the middle of the game.
A movie game he played with Kegin Jacobs found Craig Halket, but Alan Lithgow and Craig Halket fought side by side.
The Ragers team showed a man but seems to have only hope but do not trust himself, especially when he arrives at the cane.
Alfredo Morelos believes that he should be given a grade in 15 minutes when he met Steven Lawles but the performers, and Thomson refused the Colombian game.
Ragers ’ team was able to fight only twice on the bull, but the old Ragers ’ team team, Liam Kelly, did not suffer from soccer from Lasna Colibally and Ovie Ejaria.
The 34 minutes that the Livingston team discovered was contrary to the movements of the games, but no one would deny that the team was supposed to find the key.
The Ragers ’ team also refused to remove the ball from Jacobs film.
Scott Arfield did not stop the ball when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly played and gave it to Menga who easily lost it.
Gerard showed his discontent with the Ragers team when he pulled out the Colulibaly and introduced Ryan Kent and the change to produce good fruits with urgency as the athletes gave her Morelos, but Kelly, who played the game, ran out of the game.
On the other hand, the Lvingston team urged Ragers to play their favorite soccer team, and Lithgow and Halkett simply removed long ones.
The Holt’s team could have added to its yoke at the end of the games, but McGregor had to protect Jacobs well before giving the ball at the top of his head.
Ragers ’ performer Glenn Middleton cried out with Jacobs, but Thomson, the performers, also refused the invitation.
Almanac: Geiger Counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, the last 136 years to this day, and TOURE ... the date of the future scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger had developed a system of identification and experimented with the production of atom - generated energy, which eventually made it the Geiger Counter.
As a major tool of science since then, the Geiger Council has become a well - known weapon, such as in 1950’s “Bells of Coronado, ” as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans seem to be unconvincing scientists:
Brother: What is that?
Rogers: "It is the Geiger Counter, used to locate electrical salt, such as uranium.
If you have doubts about these dials on your head, you can feel the effects of the energy generated by atoms."
Evans: "The truth is wonderful!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before she was 63 years old.
But its products survive.
A new vaccine for cancer has been able to help the immune system to detect dangerous cell
The new vaccine for cancer can help the immune system to ‘ recognize and kill dangerous cells. ’
A vaccine has helped the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as one way to treat the disease.
This process involves removing body cells from the patient, adjusting them to the library
Then they can see the protein that is rich in cancer and then give it an injection of ions.
A test vaccine offers hope for a wide variety of cancer patients.
One woman with the aid of this vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify dangerous cells, saw her ovarian cancer coming to an end for the past 18 months.
This process involves removing body cells from the patient, adjusting them to the laboratory so that he can see "see" the widely accepted protein of HER2 cancer, and restore the cells to the body.
Professor Jay Bezofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our actions indicate that we have a vaccine to help us."
HER2 "is associated with a number of types of cancer, "including breast cancer, birth cancer, lung and colon cancer, Prof Berzofsky has explained.
The same method of removal of cells from patients and the "training" of cancer management is also effective in treating the type of blood cancer.
When it appeared on the SNL, the West started the Trump Camp, dressed in a painted hat and made a mighty America.
The Long Road to Recovery
Well, West was despised in the advisory on Saturday Night Live after performing a series lauding the U.S. President and said that Donald Trump would win 2020 elections.
After he had sung his third host Town that night, in which he was wearing the Trump of the Cave Again, he spoke harshly to the Democrats and repeated that he was supporting Trump.
"I often talk with the white man and say: ‘ How can you love Trump, and prejudice?'
So, if I had been anxious and prejudiced, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL had begun the exhibition with Matt Damon and Hollywood's technicalist Brett Kavanaugh before the Justice Council on the topic of the rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not reported, West comments were sent to a chat room by the social ris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock tries to discredit the West and what he has stolen on the Internet.
On the other hand, the West had pleaded with the audience that they had suffered a great deal because of their cover at the back of the stage.
"He threw me into the back of the stage.
They said, 'don' is the cover.'
They abused me!
Then I’m said to be in an extinct environment," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the run - down areas?" saying, ‘ He will wear my professional hat, because it means you don’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to advance? ’
Try to show love. "
His comments were made up twice by the audience and the SNL members appear to be embarrassed, Variety wrote this, and the man in the same way says: "The whole of the story was silent."

They are free.
If we too," he also said.

A actress on the Game of Thorns Kit Harington vents his frustration on sexuality
Kitt Harington, who is known to strike with a knife, is like Jon Snow in a HBO of Thorns.
But a 31 - year - old actress argued that such responsibilities mean that young men often feel they have to be mature to be respected.

'When I’m alone, I’m surprised yet - where did we work to do it?' he said.
'What are we teaching men when they are growing up, at least for the problem we see here?'
Kit believes that a movie producer may be one factor in the development of this behavior, but we are grateful that some of its models have good manners.
He continued: ‘ What is mankind’s origin and what is taught?
What lessons are presented in a movie screen, and in places that make young men feel that they must be that way?
What adjustments can we make in this regard?
The reason is clear that something is wrong with boys. '

HIV and AIDS: China reported an increase in the number of infected people and 14 percent of the population
It has reported that the number of HIV / AIDS cases has risen to 14 percent.
An estimated 820,000 people are infected in the country, health experts say.
The peak attendance of 40,000 was reported to be just a quarter of the first four - fourths of 2018 ’ s.
Many of them contracted the virus through sexual intercourse that brought about a change in conditions.
The HIV virus is first spread widely in some areas through blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV infection cases in this way has been reduced dramatically, says Chinese health officials at a meeting in the Yunnan region.
Each year the number of HIV cases has risen to 100 million.
Hiv’s sexually transmitted disease has increased dramatically in the sexual relations of people of the opposite sex.
The rulings against homosexual relationships in China were abolished in 1997, but discrimination against homosexuals has become increasingly prevalent in the country.
In a country where it is not considered objectionable, studies have shown that nearly 70 to 90 percent of men who engage in homosexual acts eventually marry women.
The widespread spread of the virus in these relationships is the result of promiscuous sexual activity.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised to provide HIV - positive treatment for everyone in an effort to combat the virus.
Maxine Waters said that it was the worker who issued a message about the Republican parliamentary counsel, and said that this is a "bug lie" and ‘ a mere lie.'
The American representative Maxine Waters turned down reports that workers on his office sent a secret message to three social editors of the Republican Party on the page on the advice line.
Waters of Los Angeles said that it is published by “men and pages ” on the Internet that are a threat to public history.
"This is a lie, a very serious lie," Waters said in a message on the Twitter page.
The message contained addresses and phone numbers from Sens, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hitch, Utah.
It appeared on the fourth page of Capitol Hill, after which the secret person was appointed to the Supreme Court as Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
The message was released when the three advisers interviewed Kavanough.
The Conservative Web sites such as Gateway Punit and RedState have also stated that the IP address that identifies the source of the site were connected with Waters office and issued much about the Waters worker, says Hill.
"This empty case is a total lie," Waters said.
"My office personnel, mentioned by name, and its secret message and security has been posted on the platform because of the false - o-oque news it did not issue.
This foolish story is a total lie.'
Waters ’ comments have been criticized by a number of people on the Internet, including the former secretary - general of the White House of Arleischer.
"This refusal is an expression of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that he has no potential to be a House of Rules.
If a person is falsely accused, he need not feel angry.
They should not be disrespectful toward authority.
Get involved with the false claims of those who lie about him.
She should be calm and calm.
Fleischer’s statements of Waters ’ speech as well as the criticism of judges, Kavanaugh, and Democrats, who were accused of answering in anger on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a representative of the Republican party who was about to remove Waters from their central seat, also spoke at Twitter.
"The most important, if true, ” he wrote on Twitter.
Waters later said that his office had informed the police of the matter.
"We will make sure that those who publish these are known," he continued, "and they will be judged according to the laws of what they have done because it is dangerous and disturbing to anyone working at my office."
Responsive of Johnny English Strikes Again - Myth of uninhibited Atkinson’s unappetation
It is obvious that it is now to highlight the advantages of the British Development of the European Union in every British movie and the same thing in the film’s other Johnny English - appeared in 2003 with the Jonny English film and returned in 2011 with the Joint English Revorn revised film.
Would a frank, open - minded talk in this matter show the folly of making the world a commercial one?
In any case, Johnny English with big eyes and blind eyes had the ability to do things a second time — showing that he had the potential to produce a humorous English - speaking film.
He is an ideal person who even pretends to be a policeman like Bean, as well as a British official’s Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics in London.
The story comes from Atkinson’s journey to an old movie business in Barclay’s public movie, which has brought the fair.
You can find it in Johnny English a funer or two of this new film.
I was happy when Johnny English followed the plane with his old protective glasses and a knife running on his shoulder.
Atkinson’s sense of humor is seen, but its lurid appearance is relatively simple and creative as it is seen to have a fine sense of humor on the clock of 007 and Missions.
His humor seems to have come from children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English visits are less and less natural than Atkinson’s films and were like Bean.
At the beginning of this article, it shows that Britain is in serious trouble.
Some computer users mistakenly entered Britain’s British bulletin computers and issued a message for all British soldiers in different directions, which disturbed a soldier in another area and a small part in the exhibition of Kevin Eldon.
It is the last thing of a senior high official who is self - assured and suffering, who sees the problems of his political neutrality: Emma Thompson is doing a vicious act on the side he took in the drama as Teresa May, but in the drama there is nothing to add to it.
Her wise counselors tell her that since each worker has been distracted, he should hire someone else.
And this means Johnny English, a high - school principal, who teaches about the operation of a private soldier: the pope has good things, while the English teaches various children about kidnapping.
English has suddenly been taken to a convention in Whitehall and met with a longtime colleague, Bough, who was also taken by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, married to a water force leader, part of an autobiography whose Vicky Pupperrdine was abused.
Thus it is that Batman and Robin who act wrongly in the army of the great King have also been employed, who has met the son of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova, who is the source of motivation.
Now the prime minister is distracted by the conduct of a rich man who claims to be able to solve the problems of Britain’s computer program: Jason Volta, taken by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough take up their work: as food suppliers, they set fire to the French dining - room fire; this led to a bulge until they entered the Volta train; and English set up a riot when they wanted to use a listening system to see what was inside Volta’s house.
All last things take place in the final, but how exciting and self - centered they are, showing that they are children’s film in all directions.
A little fun.
As was the case with some Johnny English films, I was unable to think: Can’t British filmmakers contribute to the Roman Atikson to discover his art?
The Labor Organization denies that it provides a system for British citizens to work four days a week but to pay five days ’ wages
The Jeremy Corbyn movement has had a big idea that the British are working four days a week without pay for five days.
The goal is to provide workers with a false day of rest for their employees.
The program will allow workers to spend three days at rest but will receive the same amount.
According to the results, this concept can be a “coordination ” with the economic thinking of the world and the idea of changing the world in favor of the workers.
A four - day job change was approved by the Employees as a way for workers to benefit from the technological advances.
An elder from the Labor Party party told The Sunday Times: 'Refusing this procedure is expected to be announced within a year.
'A day is impossible, but a four - day working system on a week is well suited to political principles so that the workers can benefit from the economic development and development of new businesses.'
The Labor Organization is not beginning to confirm this view, while the Green party promised four days of work on the Sabbath during election in 2017.
However, this is not the viewpoint of all members of the Labor Party.
A minister of the Labour Party said: 'A four - day sabbath is not political and is not thought of by the party.'
Shadrow Chancellor and John McDonnell used the opportunity of the Labor Party conference after the week was able to express his opinion on how to benefit the world’s resources.
McDonnell says that he is determined to regain power from the non-hoped ‘ organizers' and 'help' of the services.
The goal of the leader also means that those who share in the water industry will not return all their money as the Labor government may create some of the money for reasons they feel are wrong.
They also established a plan that would subscribe workers to 10 percent, which would cost the workers £500 a year.
A Lindsey Graham, by John Kennedy on "60 Minutes" as the FBI research on Kavanough article may change their opinion.
The FBI’s investigation of a case accused by Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his last election in the Supreme Court and about a week, raising the question if the research will be needed to change any state of restaurants in the Republic to help him.
In a speech broadcast on Sunday, the reporter Scott Pelley, Scott Pelley, interviewed the Republican state ministers John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that could cause them to change their thinking.
Kennedy spoke more openly than his partner from South Carolina.
"True, that is, ” Kennedy said.
"As I am going to hear this case, I have spoken to Justice Kavanaugh.
I sang to him after these things, and his words came out, and he said, ‘ Did you do this?'
She was courageous, determined, and absolutely free."
Graham’s gun, however, seems unlikely to be moved.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanough is consistent and I must change only when the case is serious," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I do not know what happened, but I know only this: Brett strongly objected, "Graham pointed out, about Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who calls him cannot prove this.
It was an event that took place 36 years ago.
I see nothing that can change in the meantime."
What is the Festival of International Music, and what has been done to alleviate poverty?
On the following Saturday, the New York City is the host of the celebration. It is held each year, and a number of musicians sing for the same purpose, ending the world’s poverty.
This year the seven-year celebration will include thousands of visitors to the Central Park National Park for the purpose of enjoying not only as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes as well as the public distribution of the celebration that will end poverty by the year 2030.
The 2012 International Music Group is part of the Global Poverty Project’s program to fight poverty on a global scale by increasing the number of people who are fighting the fight against poverty.
To receive a ticket to this party (letting to buy a ticket for respectable people), attendees must do a variety of jobs or things such as dedication, sending a letter on the Internet to the president of the country, renting a telephone or any other device that would help to publish the cause of poverty.
How successful, though, was the 12 - year project to be carried out?
Is the way to give free attention to the free view of the performers, or is it a way of getting people to do something on the Internet, feeling that they are doing something better by signing a document or sending a message on the Tutata?
Since 2011, organizers of the Convention have estimated to have at least 19 million items to be launched for their respective objectives.
These measures, they say, have helped to encourage the world’s leaders to resolve their own expenses and to arrange for $27 billion to be assisted by 2030 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the organization pointed to 390 round - trip (U.S.) events, which amounted to $10 billion (U.S.).
The combined profits made it possible to affect the lives of 649 million people on earth.
Among other things, such as the UK, which works “to help children to grow to maturity, ” which promises to help Rwanda with $35 million to fight children, this happened after the commission received a message on Twita.
"With the aid of the UK government, the well - wishers, international governments, and people like you, we can stop dancing" from one of the health - promotions, the Tracey Ullman told a London orchestra in April 2018.
By means of over 5,000 voices, the organization was encouraged to encourage the UK to improve the health of mothers and children, and the government announced financial aid to the five million mothers and children.
In answer to the question they received on their e - mail asking, ‘ Why do you think we can put an end to poverty? ’
The group answered: "It will be a hard fight and a long time, and we will get tired and give up.
Yet, if the prevailing freedom movement of the past is at work, we too can accomplish our goals because there is power behind it.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monanie and some of the performers at New York's banquet, which would be conducted by Deborra-Le Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the military to "cut off" Russia to export power -
The United States, ‘ if necessary, ’ uses its Ocean’s market to provide the Russian export and export power, including the Asian countries, US Ryan Zinke said, according to Washington Examiner's report.
Zinke said that Russia’s work in Syria, where the country is under siege by an approved government and by a false means of obtaining precious stones and power.
"I believe that the Russian government has sent its citizens to Asia to find a market of power as a country doing European surrender," he said.
In fact, he added that there are ways to cope with these.
"The American country has such potential, with the use of our sea Forces, we can open the gates and if necessary we can prevent their power from reaching the market," he said.
Zinke says this on the left prepared by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that calls itself “a speech of power users ” in the United States.
He said that the struggle that Washington could fight against Russia was the same as he had dealt with Iran, saying that his goal would be the same.
"The means of obtaining Russian wealth and Iran, and the same, raising and changing oil oil," he said, comparing Russia with "the goods" of oil.
This has come when the Trump government is on a campaign to promote its oil trade in Europe, replacing Russia with the cheapest of its oil.
In this regard, the Trump chiefs, including president of the state Donald Trump, are trying to force Germany out of the Nord Strem 2 policy that was associated with Russia, Trump said that the policy had made Germany a ‘ slave ’ of Russia.
Russia has been claiming that the Nord Stream 2 billion dollars budget, which should increase its production to a maximum of 110 billion cubic feet [110 billion cu m] in length and at its lowest rate, is just an economic system.
The Russian Union has long recognized the U.S. economic hatred and hatred as an example of the world’s oppression of commerce.
"I believe we agree that power trade cannot be a threat to others and that power users must have the opportunity to decide for them to sell them," said President Aleksandr Novak after meeting the American Minister of Power, Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. occupations did not make Germany happy, and Germany insisted that they would continue to cooperate with the program.
The Federal Federation of German Industries (BDI) has asked the United States not to join the European Union on power and cooperation between Germany and Russia.
"I am very disappointed when a country engages in the purchase of power," Dieter Kemf, director of BDI, after the German president of Angela Merkel and President of Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren’s Decision on President’s Rights in 2020
On Saturday the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he would think of the "deep" participation in the president's taxes after the middle elections.
At a convention in Hotti, Massachusetts, Warren determined to take part.
Warren replied that it was time for her to go to Washington to repair our damaged government, and this also included the supreme mother, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, she wants "to think seriously about" the matter of going to the president's election."
Warren has commented on President Donald Trump at the conference, saying that he is "taking the area in the wrong direction.
"I’m concerned to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was in the lead at the trial of Trump and Britt Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren said "We really need to study the FBI before we vote."
The Council published on Thursday, indicated that many of those in Warren’s area do not think it proper to make a choice in 2020.
Forty - eight out of the eight - percent ‘ finished ’ votes from Massachusetts that the business should not take part, according to the Soffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent agreed with the question of participation.
The survey shows that many people agree that the ancient governor of Doval Patrick must participate, while 38 percent support the possibility and 48 percent are opposed.
Other well - known figures of the Democrat movement, who are said to have joined in 2020, were Second to President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that he would make a good choice when he arrived in January, says the Associated Press.
Sarah Kiin referring to PTSD’s problem with Track Kiin at a Donal Trump conference
Track Kanin, aged 26, lived a year in Iraq after being registered on Sep.
She was arrested and convicted on Monday nights of domestic violence
‘ My son’s experience, as he returned, can be understood by other families affected by PTSD and some of our military experiences, ’ he told the audience at the Donld Trump convention in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Kanin said that his arrest is a ‘ big issue which no one wants to call ’ and concerning their son and other fighting men, "they have returned a little change, they are back strong, they come back wondering if there is respect for their fellow soldiers and workers, and every other member of the army has delivered to the country."
She was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of mistreating another woman, damaging reports of domestic violence and of possession of an alcohol - related weapon, according to Dan Bennett, the Minister of Police in Wasilla.
18 regions and D.C. opposition to a new policy of asylum
Thirty - eight territories as well as the District of Columbia are protesting a new law in the U.S. that rejects the assistance of terrorists and domestic violence.
The lawyers from the 18 provinces and provinces of Friday were charged in the Washington court to help the refugee who is seeking protection and against the law, according to the NBC News report.
The complainer’s name in Grace v. whom the American Civil Liberties Union had signed in October against the government’s policies was not revealed.
She also said that her husband was “but a mob of her own violent children, ” persecuted her, but the US authorities denied her request to leave home on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The attorneys of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which bring many U.S. asylums, such as the countries suffering from mob violence and domestic violence.
A new U.S. policy of protecting refugees changed the decision of 2014 by the Board of General Appeals to allow unconventional migrants to escape domestic violence in order to seek protection.
The chief Justice of the District of Columbia says that Friday in their statement this law "disregisters the law of decades of countries, governments, and all countries."
‘ The law requires that all complaints of refugees for threats be judged on the basis of reality and on the basis of the facts, and such restrictions violate the law, ’ the lawyers said.
The mayor also pointed out that this policy against foreign entry could be damaging to the U.S. economy, suggesting that these foreigners could become commercial and "energic workers."
In June, Justice Jeff Sesions ordered judges handling foreign immigration cases not to provide shelter for those who had been victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
‘ Protection is given to those who have left their homes because of persecution or fear of race, religion, country, or social status, ’ the Court did so in declaring the decree on June 11.
Providing protection does not mean solving all the problems and problems that people around the world are facing with each day of life.

For survivors, things are getting worse.
"It’s a very difficult thing," said 35 - year - old Risa Kunma, to comfort her son with malaria at a rescue site in the devastated city of Pola.
"Every time a ambulance brings dead bodies.
Clean water does not come easily.
People seem to return to their damaged homes, carrying their cargo in flooding waters, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, as well as hospitals, which have been devastated by a massive earthquake of 7.5, have not been able to meet the needs.
Some of the victims, including Dwi Haris, who suffered back and backbreak, had a rest outside the Palla Hospital, where patients received outside aid from other serious earthquakes were on the way.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the powerful earthquake that shook the fifth hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for us to save ourselves.
He flung me in the ruins of the wall, thinking, "Hiss had told the Associated Press, adding that his family was the eunuch to perform the wedding ceremony.
‘ I heard my wife cry for help, and it was silent.
I don’t know what happened to her and to my son.
I hope she is OK.."
The United States has said that China is carrying an 'dangerous' message.
A week after a reliable Chinese newspaper placed a business message in a four - page American newspaper about anti - American trade unions in both countries, a representative of the United States said that China is using the American newspaper to spread false news.
Last year, U.S. president of the United States, Donald Trump, commented on a special section of the newspaper Des Moines Register - a major newspaper in Iowa, which was read out of China’s newspaper - which the president of China, said in an effort to interfere with the decision of American counselors on November 6, China.
According to Reuters news reports by American leaders, the Trump’s case on U.S. national elections showed a new American national campaign to combat China.
While it is acceptable for foreign countries to post commercial media, China and the United States are competing with one another in the trade, a conflict that has caused both countries to be heavily charged with the import of theirs.
The tax imposed on American goods was to deal with the success of Iowa merchants who are associated with the Trumps of the Republic, said researchers of China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, a representative of China’s United States and the mayor of Iowa, who is responsible for most of China’s agricultural operations, said that China’s activities were a source of frustration for American workers, farmers, and merchants.
Writing in the newspaper Des Moines Register, the Branstad said that "China is writing more confusing information in our own journals."
"In spreading his lie, the Chinese government is using the freedom to speak with the freedom of the American media to pay for commercial advertising in the newspaper Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, at the street market in Beijing, you find a few objections and you will not see anything that China has to do with China’s economic problems, since journalists are in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
Without mention, they added that "one of China’s best - known newspapers had missed the opportunity to publish his story.
The Republican Council for Women’s Prosecution for Kavanh, admiral of the U.S.
When many of the Republican leaders agree with the Brett Kavanough’s appointment of a judge at the Supreme Court of Supreme and the Kavanough are thought to have attempted rape, experts say that this will cause problems, especially from the mother in the coming taxes.
This issue has caused much resentment, and the Republican organization has publicly declared it ready to make a choice in favor of the separating of the Kavanghs.
These things can never be undone, ” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political studies at Maxwell University of Syracuse in an interview with The Hill newspaper on a Saturday.
The Reherr says that it is suggested that since the FBI’s investigation of Arizona’s regional adviser, Jeff Flake’s time to stop the anger of the young men, it has been suggested that it would be more likely that he would end the relationship with the military.
"Mom will never forget what happened yesterday or in November," Karine Jean- Pierre, executive director of the Moveon group, said on Friday, according to reports in the Washington DC.
On Friday morning, players sing "November is coming!" when they perform exhibitions in the law hall while the Republican committee’s directors of the election decided to continue the election of the Kavanaugh despite the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said the journal Mic.
"An interest in democratic affairs is on the decline," Stu Rothenberg, political analyst, told the newspaper.
"People say that this interest has always been high; it’s true.
But it could be particularly high among local women and youths aged 18 to 29 who can vote, who do not even like the president, but do not vote."
Despite evidence of the public arrests of the Kavanoughs, researchers say that if the Republican movement could prove its independence of the Kavangh people would be very angry.
"These have shown the wrongness of the GGP party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, a week ago according to reports in NBC.
"It is not only the decision of the committee or the last vote or election of the Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court judge, but the way the Republican has handled the matter and how he has dealt with the woman," Guy Macel, director of the U.S. Women's Democrat, an organization that contributes to the decision of the Democratic Party.
The Americans, however, seem to have a wide range of opinions on the subject based on the evidence of Ford and Kavanaugh, and most are on the Kavanaugh side.
The new Yonov Congregation showed that 41 percent of the city’s participants believe in the Ford’s evidence, and 35 percent said that they believed the Kavaught’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said that the Kavanaughs had lied in their testimony, and 30 percent said that the Ford had lied in their testimony.
Following the case of Folake, the FBI is investigating an article by Ford and Deborah Ramirez, said the Guardian newspaper.
A Ford who took an oath gave their testimony to the Parliament of the Assembly last week when he said that the victims of Kavaough’s alcoholism wanted to rape at the age of 17.
The Ramirez said that the Kavanoughs were shown their bodies after attending the feast while they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The founder of the World Wide Web site plans to set up a new site to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Le, who established the World Wide Web page, sets a web page to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google pages.
The new project of the specialist, Inrupt, and the company that wants to continue as the Solicd program was completed by Berner-Le.
Sorid allows users to select their own items and to choose the information they want to see.
Specially speaking with the newspaper Fast Company, Berners-Lee said with a laugh that Inrupt’s aim is "supply superior."
"We must do it now," he said about the page.
"It’s good news."
The program will use the Soliad program to allow people to make a "scopic site" for themselves or POD.
This program can be kept, in practice, calendar, music storage, and other personal and occupational activities.
It is as if Google Dre, Microsoft Outlook, Black, and Spotify were placed together at the same time.
An outstanding feature of the social networking site is the right of the user to choose which information he or she would like to receive.
The company refers to the development of the program as ‘ encourage people by means of the message.
The chief executive of the company, John Bruce, said that our attitude toward the Inrupt was that of bringing goods, procedures, and skills into a common audience.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, protection from IBSM, other computer workers who have been employed to organize the program and other volunteers.
Since this week, computer experts on the world have been able to organize their own software using the tools available on the Inrupt site.
Berners-Le said that she and her assistants would not talk to their "Fa Facebook" owners and Google about bringing about a complete change that would cause all their plans to be established for a short time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In an article on the Medium page that was established on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Intropts are to provide commercial powers and how environmental factors affect the environment to protect the privacy and welfare of the new program from the Solici."
In 1994 Berners-Le changed use of the Internet when she started her Web page, World Wide Web at the Massachusetts intelligent school.
During the past months, Berners-Lee has been speaking on the debate that requires the unity of all software designers.
Even if he established Inrupt, Berners-Le will still be master and master of the World Wide Web program, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I hope very much of this new program," said Berners-Le.

Just imagine, you did not go to bed all night to see Bellastor 206 playing and finally let it go.
An account from San Jose was 13 conflicts, including six on a major card and was being shown all night at the UK on Chanel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Musussi and Roy MacDonald was preparing to fight, UK viewers were surprised when the program was transformed into Peppa Pig.
Others have had difficulty keeping awake until late at night, especially since they expected the war to take place.
One of the following said at Twitter about the transformation of this program into children's identity as a mere "laugh."
"It is officially the law that this was not to be shown in the morning should be turned into a program for children," says Dave Schwarz, Bellator, the second head of the tourist and co-ordination, when asked about the matter.
"Apppg," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker’s company says that he will arrange their programs to include UK viewers in the future.
When we think of repeating the program, I think we might be able to do so, ” said Coker.
"But at six o'clock on Sunday morning there we can't do this until Sunday, Monday their time.
But we work hard to improve things.
In fact, the minute it was changing was the volume of a letter passing through and there, all of which were not as good as the case.
After trying hard to repair, we thought of the machine as being out of control.
But it was not so, it was a matter of State.
I promise you that it will never happen again.
We will prepare five fights instead of six - as we do - and have tried to feed our images further and have just missed the point.
It’s very difficult.."
Conversations on the Desert Island: A Tom Darley ‘ hides himself ’ about a group of people he likes.
A Olympic skier grew up hiding behind his favorite team, but this gave him strong encouragement to do well.
The 24 - year - old expert said he didn’t realize until he got to high school that "I’m not like everyone."
In a series of four talks on the Desert Island’s first line, published by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about the rights of homosexuals in order to give them a "hope."
He said that being a parent would deprive him of the privileges he enjoyed in sports.
The director of the program, Kirsten Young, has been unable to attend for months because of illness.
In a speech on Laverne’s first program, Darley said that the way she grew up is "we’re no" because "it’s not acceptable to love boys and girls."
She said: "To this day I feel that I’m left out and that I’m different from other people and the things that have encouraged me and gave me the strength to do well in my sports."
He wanted to show people that he was ‘ his friend, ’ he said, that he would not be offended if he learned of the group he loved.
The winner of the racer’s double prize at the Olympic Games has been known to fight for the rights of homosexuals and has been a part of the American Conmwelath Games this year in order to obtain legal rights to same - sex unions.
She said that she speaks because she felt she had the opportunity to remain free even though she expressed love for her fellow humans so that she wanted to be ‘ a source of encouragement ’ to others.
This expert who won three global drills said that it fell in love with an American film model - Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "I was disturbed."
Dary married a movie star, who won a prize in Oscar’s 20 - year - old contest but said that the difference was just 20 years older than he was.
"If you have had many experiences at this age" – she still plays Olympic games at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later, she said that it was difficult to find someone who met the doors he met.
In June the family became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Darley said that their "right vision" had changed.
"If you ask me last year, I just think I’d win a gold medal," he said.
"But you know? There are more good things than the gold of the Olympics.
My head of the gold of the Olympic gold is Robbie.
Her son has the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that he did not accept his father’s death, and one of his questions on whether he was willing to attend a meeting in London in 2012 was resolved by his desire for his stay in the future.
"I didn't tell them you will not be future because you will have to die," he said.
"I held her by the hand where she died and only when she died did I realize she was not eternal," he said.
The following year, Daled joined the Olympic Games in 2012 and won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was my dream of getting into the water in front of the people at the Olympic games, and there was nothing more than that," he said.
This also encouraged his first choice of proud’s song by Heather Small - which encouraged him to prepare for the Olympic Games and still offers him a drink.
Desert Island Discss is located on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was left out on Saturday’s Ryder Eve drama
Phil Mickelson of the United States has been making a name for the Church when 47 games played the Role of Ryder but had to go beyond what he has been doing in the past to avoid any bad reputation.
Mickelson, who played the 12th board at the end of the two years, was placed outside and played instead by the leader of the player, Jim Furyk in four soccer games with four players.
Instead of being one of the players of the day, his performance of a top - score American team was five times more likely to greet his friends and make plans so as to promote his sport.
The 48 - year - old athletes, who were not the most dangerous in their sporting career, are not the best players in the wild of the Gulf National soccer team, which has a long-squarter beat.
And if the race is not the most dangerous, Mickelson, in the ninth series, will meet Francesco Molinori, a British athlete who played with Tommy Fleetwood, who is the first to win four games this week.
If American athletes, who are left with four players at the start of 12 games, are more likely to perform well, Mickelson’s games can be very important.
Furyk said he had confidence in the specialist, but he did not say much.
“ He understood what he should do today, thanked me, and hugged me, and told me that he was ready for the morning games, ” Furyk said.
"He is self - dependent.
He is an expert who has been performing dozens of games in the past, as well as this week.
I don’t expect her to play two games.
I look forward to playing many games, but that’s how we felt we were supposed to be.
He wants to play like everyone else."
On Sunday Mickleson's plays is more than Nick Faldo on playing many games in the Ryder cup.
This will lead to a play at the end of the game which is not the same as the individual game.
Mickelson won 18 triumphs, 20 triumphs and 7 times equal force, yet Furk says that his presence encourages his team.
"He’s a good man, he’s a good man, he’s a joke, he laughs, and he’s a good man to be with him," he explained.
"I think young athletes were thrilled when they played with him, this week, which was fun to see.
He gives more than just play."
European team leader Thomas Bjorn knows that their leadership can end
Thomas Bjorn knows from history that their leading role in the games can easily change and become a difficult object for protection.
The Danish player was playing his first game at Valdermara in 1999, where the former Seven Ballesteros led five points above the U.S. team but was able to win only 141 ⁄2 votes for 131 £2).
"I remember that we took the lead in Valderrama; we took the lead in Brookline, where we won the victory, and in Valdermara, but with a few points," Bjorn said, after seeing the best team in 2018, winning 5-3 Friday and at least 10-6 in the morning in the contest of Le Golf National.
Thus history teaches me and everyone in the team that the games are not finished.
We need to work hard in the future.
Let’s go to the theater and go on and do a lot of good.
The “Eureka Drama ” was invented to“ Class Extension Work, ” as it were.
Our goal is to try to outrun this cup, and this is where we should focus our attention.
I have said that I am interested in the twelve players in our team, and we know who we are going to play the best in the world."
Excited by the way his athletes played in a game’s game arena, Bjorn said: "I can’t feel myself.
The mood is one of many.
Personal talents should be viewed as gifts to be made in the morning, and this is a difficult thing to do.
It is good to play with a partner when things are going well, but only for yourself, if the player is caught up in a contest.
The message that should be conveyed to players is that you have to do the same with your own male to play the game for the next day.
Here, you leave your partner to play with him, and he should do the same for himself."
In contrast with the Bjorn team, Jim Furyk will want his players to be stronger than the two players, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who found three fourths of the four points.
Furyk himself has had both major changes, when he had been a team that won the Brookline before being a member of a team that had failed while the European team was "miracle" in Medinah.
"I remember everything," he said in reply when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the leader of 1999, encouraged his athletes by the last day of the games.
"We have 12 games, but we need to be on our way to the first, as you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When this happens, one of the players in the middle of the game becomes stressed.
We have arranged our games and have played to show that we want to do something surprising in the future."
Thomas has been commissioned to initiate a reduction in the leadership of fellows and will play with the Rory Mcllroy in major games, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poloter's team will play with European team players.
"I put the athletes in this way because I believe it will help us to the end," he said when he spoke of his choice of the game.
The founding of a German warship has also been changed
A new German warship was to be established in 2014 to replace the former Allied battleship, but it is not working until the next year because of the collapse of the ship's program and the changes in prices, the country's local newspaper said.
According to reports in the newspaper Die Zeit, the formation of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz," the ship leading the new ship of Baden-Wuerttemberg has been changed until the first stage of 2019.
The ship had to be used by the military in 2014, but the difficulty in bringing it interfered with the formation of the ship.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships purchased in 2007 will replace the Bremen's old ships.
We feel that the ships are equipped with powerful guns, bombers, and other explosives as well as some modern technology, such as the launching of planes that cannot be detected by modern navigational devices.
Some of the requirements are that the ships can work for long periods before they are designed and that they can use them away from our ports for two years.
However, the delay in using the train - which would change Germany’s operations in other countries - means that the use of them will be achieved after the ships are short, reports Die Zeit.
The failure of the F125 fleet was well - known last year when German naval officers refused to set up the ship and returned to the Blohm and Vos in Hamburg.
This was the first time that he had been released from prison to buy a train from a railway company.
The reasons for the return of the ship were not well known, but German newspapers announced that there were "dangers and needed programs and services" on the ship that would make the ship useless if used.
The difficulty of systems was a major factor, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships are supposed to carry 120 - half of the soldiers aboard the ancient Bremen.
Furthermore, it has been known that the ships are heavily laden that reduce the efficiency of their operation and prevent soldiers from developing them.
The ships of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" weigh up to 7,000 tons, which mean they weigh twice as much as the German fleet used in World War II.
Contrary to the errors of the ship's design, the cost of all ship-handling systems, including training sailors - is causing problems.
It is estimated that its value reached at $33.1 billion ($3.6 billion) and that of the total number of U.S. billions of dollars it was put first.
The problems associated with the ships become even more important when German naval practice is reported to be declining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans- Peter Bartels, head of the security committee in the German parliament, admitted to being abandoned on the ship.
The officer said that this has been a long time since the old ships had stopped using them but have not been replaced.
He concluded that among the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships there was no ship to be used by the Allieds of the country.
National Trust giving a view to bats ’ lives
A new research carried out in a home in Scottish Highlands seeks to discover how bats use the shape of land for cooking food.
It is hoped that what they find will also shed light on the new wildlife and help to improve the care of the future.
A scientific study conducted at the National Trust for Scotland will take a closer look at the best known species and the soprano pispresselles and the Daubenton whales in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed around the location needed to follow the practice of bats throughout this period.
The members of the NHS and the volunteers will also do extensive research by means of manual research.
An examination of the sounds recorded by experts will reveal the intensity of the sounds of bats and what types are doing.
The information map can also be prepared to provide more information about their environment and behavior.
Rob Dewar, safety adviser to NTS, believes that the results will reveal areas where bats are most important and how they are used by any species.
This will help them to appreciate the value of caring for their surroundings, such as cultivating a good crop of grass and caring for the bats and other types of plants.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has dropped dramatically in the past century.
They are threatened with construction and development that affect the way bats gather to rest during the day and the loss of their habitat.
Air and light can also serve as a protection against threats, such as paper that handle flies and other building substances, as well as by cats.
The bats are not very blind.
However, because of their night - hunting habits, their ears are more valuable than their eyes if they want to catch animals.
He uses a method that he can take to identify the flies and obstacles that are flying.
NTS, which oversees more than 270 old homes, 38 precious acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, views bats as important.
It consists of ten well - trained professionals, often doing research, inspecting the locations of the bats ’ resting places and, at times, making lifesaving preparations.
The Society has also established an isolated exhibit in Scottland, Threave in Dumpries and Galloway, an eight species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the director of the facility, says that the site is the best for them.
"Here we have the best place for bats," he said.
‘ We have old homes, old trees, and beautiful surroundings.
But there are many things about bats that are not yet known, so the work we do here and in other homes will help us to understand more fully what is needed for good living.
He also spoke of the need to investigate the bats before building a house, since destroying a single breeding site of the bats could kill 400 amphibians and children, and this could kill all bats in the area.
Dolphins are protected and not allowed to kill, torture, or destroy their habitats.
Elisabeth Ferrrell, director of Scotland’s Battle Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to support themselves.
He said: "We still have much to learn about our bats, and most of our species don’t know what they are like."
Ronaldo refuses to touch someone, and his lawyers try to print a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has been accused of rape by “false stories, ” saying that people ‘ want to exalt themselves ’ by using his name.
His lawyers wanted to print the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which published this article.
A Portuguese and Juventunus activist, Kathryn Mayorga, a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009, is blamed for the rape of an American woman.
She was said to have paid $35,000 to keep her informed of what had happened, and Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking in the Instram Live video to 142 million of his followers a few hours after they were told, Ronaldo, 33 years old, denounced the reports as "false stories."
"No, no, not, no, not."
What has been said today is a false story," winning Ballon d’Or five times through a camera.
"He wants to exalt himself by using my name.
It is not unusual
They want to be known by my name, but that’s the kind of work I’m doing.
I am a happy and healthy person, "the player is added, he smiles.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to introduce Der Spiegel in this case, which is said to be "an unprovable reports on the mysteries," according to Reuters.
Justice Christian Schertz said that the player could ask tears for the loss of his moral integrity to the level of the case, which should be the most serious case against the reputation and right of an adult in recent years."
It is said that it was held in the rooms of Palms Hotels and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga said that they had returned to the player’s room, where they reportedly raped him, according to the paper kept at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell after what she said and told her that it was "99%" "a good man" who lost only "1%."
The documents say that Ronaldo had made sure that the two had engaged in sexual intercourse, but they did so after they had agreed.
Mayorga also said that she had gone to the police where pictures of her injuries had been taken from the hospital, but later she agreed to resolve the matter by themselves because she saw that she was "in fear of being reinstated" and was concerned about "dignified in the community."
Now, 34 years of age, she says that she wants to change her decision to settle the matter on her own while still being tormented by what has been said.
Ronaldo was about to win the Real Madrid team from Manchester United, and the following summer she moved to the Juve team in Italy for £100 million (U.S.).
Brexit: UK will always be reported on the loss of vehicle manufacturers
UK "I'll always lose her status as a world number after the development of cars after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said this.
He also said that ‘ it affects you ’ that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain was out of the EU without cooperation, it could temporarily stop her doing her factory in Burkaston, near Derby.
"We want unity," says Mr. Clark.
A car manufacturer in Japan said that long - term delays at the border if there is no cooperation on the Buxit issue could result in job loss.
The Burnaston plant - forming Auris and Avenosis of Toyota - has produced about 150,000 cars last year when 90% were sent to other European countries of the Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we can see the creative works in our factory., says Marvin Cooke, chief overseer at Toyota in Altnaston.
Some UK automobile manufacturers spoke of their fears and about leaving the EU without an international partnership, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW will close his factory at Oxford for a month after Bexit.
A major concern for vehicle manufacturers is that the uncertainty of a matter involving consumerism in a case of unconventable behavior.
Toyota makes its vehicles ‘ counters and applications ’ to its customers, and every 37 minutes of transport from the UK and EU vendors on cars that are designed for customers.
If the UK leaves the EU without unity on March 29, there may be disturbing developments on the border that factories claim to cause delay and lack of vehicle causes.
It may not be possible for Toyota to handle a day - long production at his Derbyshire factory, the company has said, thus making it possible to be dried up.
The Theresa May of the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, says Clark, "was carefully established to avoid delays at the border."
"We want to be united. We want to have a very good cooperation that will allow as I say not only to talk about victory now but also to use this opportunity, "I told BBC Radio 4 on Today's program.
The evidence from not only Toyota and other designers is that we need to keep up with the most effective method of distributing sales to customers. ”
Toyota could not say how long it would be to be established, but in time, she indicated that the additional cost would be able to reduce the cost of the factory’s sales against other factories and eventually cost the job.
Peter Tsouvalris, who has worked for 24 years in Burnaston and who has been working for the union in Uniquity, says that its members are seriously concerned: "When I have lost these jobs, they will never return.
The government prophet said: "We have established an accurate and reliable system concerning our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump and Rosenstein conference, said the White House
The Royal Assembly of Donald Trump and the second of the attorney general Rod Rosenstein ends ‘ late another week ’ while the struggle against those chosen at the High Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House's executives said on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises a special project conducted by Robert Mueller, who is researching Russian elections, the union between the Trumpists and Russia as well as what the President can do to pervert justice.
Whether Trump’s work is to be dismissed by a government judge or not, and thus breaking Mueller’s rights, gossip has been introduced for months in Washington.
Early in this month, the New York Times said that Rosenstein had discussed with the critics the instruments to record a dialogue with Trump as well as the possibility of depose the president by means of the 25th decree.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday she went to White House, where there was reports of her resignation.
Instead, the conference with Trump, then located in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would not be willing to remove Rosenstein from his job but later that the conference was delayed to be attended once again with a meeting of the Senate Council of Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual immorality, Christine Blesey Ford, all testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the trial for a week, so I delayed the whole ruling of Sennacherib.
Writer of Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein conference, he said: “The day of these things has not been set up, it can be this week, and I can see that it is late one week in view of all the other developments in the high court.
But we’ll see how it works, and I would like the press to know the latest news.'
Some journalists may object: Sanders has never been in the White House since September.
Cris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the decline of the meetings was not due to a rejection of the "voluntarily popularity" of the "TV", although he said: "I can’t deny the idea that it’s popular."
Then it was said that the direct link between Trump and journalists would grow.
"Purdu makes more parts of questions and answers than any previous president has ever," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "Show those numbers."
Newspaper conferences will continue to be held, Sanders said we were, but "if the journalists have the opportunity to ask questions directly, it’s better to talk with me.
We’re trying to do this very much and we’re doing this a few weeks ago, and this will take place instead of meeting the journalists where you can communicate directly with the president of the United States."
Trump always answers questions when he leaves White House or goes for a discussion with those who are respected.
Personal meetings are limited.
In New York this week the president may explain why, at times, he makes a free appearance and sometimes surprises in front of a group of journalists.
Health writer writing to officials in the EU of NHS Scotland because of the Brexit’s fear
A health secretary who wrote to the EU’s UNHCR in Scotland expressed my desire to remain in Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months to leave the UK in the EU.
The Scottish government has already dedicated itself to paying the bride - price to its EU citizens.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "This summer, discussions between the UK and EU on travel continue, and I hope the choices will be made at the end of this rainy season.
But the UK State also encouraged planning for the outcome of any cooperation.
I know that this must be a very difficult time for all of us.
That is why I want to repeat now how I appreciate the donations of every worker, regardless of where he comes from.
Friends from all over the EU come, and more than that, to be of assistance in the development of health services, as well as to help the sick and the communities in which we serve.
Scotland is truly your home, and we would like you to be here."

International buyers will be paid high taxes when buying property in the UK
International buyers will pay high taxes when they buy property in the UK and supplements will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plan
This concept hampers Corbyn’s success in attracting youths to peer pressure
Additional taxes will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes to the UK
The economics expect to make as much as 120 million dollars a year to assist the homeless
pagans will pay a higher tax if they buy land in the UK - and the extra income will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May has announced today.
The idea seems to be a hindrance to the success of Corbyn’s efforts to persuade young people to vote with low - cost housing promises and to improve those who have received a lot of money.
Additional taxes will be passed on to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes to the UK, and supplementary income will contribute to the State’s program dealing with bed - related sleep problems.
In addition, this includes the current tax tax, including the high levels that were established two years ago in old houses and houses purchased to make rent - it may be up to about three percent.
Economists expect to make as much as 120 million dollars a year.
About 13 percent of the new building materials in London are purchased by residents other than UK, raising prices and making it difficult for consumers to make the first house - to - house territory.
Many rich areas in the country — especially within the cities — have become like "the empty villages" because of the increasing number of foreign buyers who live for long periods outside the country.
The new policy comes within weeks after Boris Johnson announced that taxes must be cut down to help many young people build a first house.
She has criticized large firms building to raise house prices by not using space, and has encouraged Mother May leave her assignments in low - cost homes in order to prepare "house shame." The British.
Corbyn has announced a list of beautiful plans for new buildings, which include adjustments in rent and removal of ‘ safely done. ’...
They are also eager to supply high - powered building powers.
May's mother said: "Last year I’ve given my first role to restore British dreams - so that life will be better for every new generation.
This means repairing our damaged house.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a comfortable life here.
However, it may not be true that it is easy for people outside the UK, as well as for outside companies, to buy homes as hardworking British citizens.
For most people, having a home is considered impossible, and sleeping under bridges remains a reality."
Jack Ross: My main goal is to teach Scotland team's
Sunderland team instructor Jack Ross says that "my main goal is to be a Scotsman at one time.
A 42 - year - old Scotsman, a 42 - year - old, enjoys the refreshing work of North - East symmetrical, which is still at the third point in the League One, with three points from the top.
He had moved to the Stadium of Light that summer after he led St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to play my country as fun.
I found a B standard and so," Ross told the Board of BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up helping Scotland and Hammpden as a child, and it always brings back memories of me.
The opportunity will come, except, after I have done well to improve the clubs.'
The first Ross if the Sunderland manager was Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
A former teacher of the Alloa Athletic says that he was not afraid to follow the names so well - known in such a large library, when he rejected what Barnsley and Ipswich Town offered.
"My success is yet to be proved by the answer to the question 'May I be able to return this class to the Premier League?'
Because of the design and materials found in the library, it is evident that it is the Premier League, ” he said.
"It’s a very difficult task to get there, but I just feel like I can get it back here."
Ross has been in his administrative office for only three years, after working as an assistant to the Dumbarton Library and for 15 months as an ordinary member of the Hert faculty.
He then helped Almaa not to drop into the third group, and he helped St Mirren’s department nearly lost its height in the contest.
Ross says that he feels better now than he did in the games Clyde, Hartlepolol, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
It may have been a time of great election, "remembering, to teach the Alloa website.
"I really believed that the administration was more suitable for me than to play.
It sounds strange because I have done well, have a good life on the job, and have a good time.
But playing sports can be challenging.
There are many things you need to do every week.
I still suffer from stress and pressure at work, but the work of oversight is much better for me.
I always want to look after it and now do it, I feel better than ever in my adult life."

The best time to drink is 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat has benefited Britain’s drinking companies who are suffering but have caused many problems in restaurants.
The dealers of alcohol have seen a 2.7% increase in alcohol sales during July - but the amount won in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, a director of the CGA, also lists these statistics, said: “The prolonged sun temperatures of the sun and the long - term impact of England’s World Cup will make July events comparable to June, when sales of alcohol have seen an up to 2.8 percent increase, apart the restaurants that have suffered a lot.
The loss of 1.8 percent of the restaurants in June was still in July.
All who sell drinks and drinks do better than restaurants.
Food and drink businesses also suffered during the summer, although they do not suffer as fast as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to drink alcohol.
The well - managed drug industry saw a 6.6 - percent increase in the same month, and the food market dropped by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a RSM tourist, said: “The following is going on to what we have seen since the end of Epril.
The climate and social or sports events have a profound effect on the purchase of goods outside the home.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to suffer, and 4.8 percent a year’s inflation is a major problem for the increase in demand.
The hot summer may not be the best time for the food vendors, and the time will show if the cold we met in August will provide needed relief."
The increase in the sale of alcohol and indulgences, including recently opened businesses, was 2.7 percent during July, to show the decrease in production of new products.
Coffer Peach Tacker is responsible for researching the UK drug and restaurants and collecting 47 groups, which have a total value of $9 billion, and their products are highly reliable.

One in five children under 11 years of age is developing acidic acids that hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed how many of the “Insta belts ” were lying on the Internet to share pictures of Instagram.
This article intensified the fear that pornography was transmitted
Twenty - one students said they have a "large ” account to show their parents, as well as some privacy.
A woman who had met a secret half of her 13 - year - old daughter noticed that the teenage girl was encouraging others to ‘ have sex with her. ’
Research, by the Digest Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistres" Conference (HMC), found 40 children in the 11th - 18th century to have two accounts, and half of them agree to keep secret accounts.
An official of the HMC Mike Buchanan said: "I’m sorry that many young people are tempted to create a social networking site unknown to their parents and teachers.."
Elidh Doyle will be the "suitary words" of the Scottish Atthletics Society
Euidh Doyle has been elected a member of the Scottish Atletics Commission as the principal executive officer at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a top sports athlete in Scotland and an athlete and a chairman of the Ian Beattie described the election as an opportunity for those who are improving the games to benefit from its many worldwide experiences during the past ten years.
"Eilidh has a great respect for all Scottish, UK and world athletes, and it is hoped that the athletes of Scotland will benefit greatly from bringing him to the team," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be like the sprinters' words and I hope to help and improve the game in Scotland."
An American, who won 200 feet [200 m] and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between the four gold discoverys and is now a well - known BBC specialist, was left unable to walk through a disorder.
He wrote at Twitter: "Last month I had a stroke.
I can’t walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell whether I would recover or how much.
It was a difficult job, but I recovered, now learning to walk again, and now I am doing a quick race!
Thank you for this upbuilding message!
Using milk pumps that compare women to milk cows has brought a wide variety of comments on the Internet
The milk - pumping company has dropped a variety of comments on the Internet and comparisons to women who are breast - feeding with milk cows are being forced.
In order to ‘ start a silent pipe, ’ Elvie’s company has set up a song with a funny film that allows the mother to breastfeed.
Four real mothers in a hayloft sing a song with the words: "Yes, I’m silent, but you don't see the tail" and "if you didn't realize that these are not the cows, and my real breasts."
The song went further as: "Pover company, company, feeding the children, the company, the company, I am getting my wives."
However, this attraction, which has been published on the company’s page, has brought on the Internet a web site.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the film has been received in various ways by viewers, many of whom are said to be exhibiting the "fear" of the milk industry.
It is the worst idea of using milk cows to feed the machine.
As we must take in and give birth to milk, unless their babies are removed within a few days after giving birth, "he has written another.
Elvie’s lap is well fitted during the match clothing (Elvie / Mother)
Another said: "I’m sorry for both mother and child.
But why not use it to burn breast milk for mothers who keep their babies?'
Another added: "This kind of mixed advertising."
Some were particularly fond of the offering, while the mother, in turn, admitted that this song was "smile."
"I think it has a good idea.
I would have one if I were still breast - feeding.
Sleeding makes me feel like a cow.
This attraction is not a good thing, but I’m not angry with it.
This is the wise thing, ‘ He wrote it down. ’
Another said: "This is an interesting thing about women who are crawling (often at work or latrines) I hear like ‘ milk cows."
This is not an invitation to be proud or to judge the milk companies.."
At the end of the film a group of women reported that all had played with secret tubes.
This concept is based on the understanding that many breast - feeding mothers say they feel like milk cows.
Elvie Pimp, however, works secretly, without a whip or shirt and is well enough in the inner clothing, and gives the mother the right to move, hold her children, and even move away at once.
Children Barin, her partner and ECD at Mother also said: "Elvie Pimp is such a new thing that should be started with care and interest.
Comparing mother to milk cows, we wanted the angle of the mat and its problems to be clear, expressing them in a pleasant and simple way to remember the freedom that this new park will bring.
This is not the first time that Levie’s camp has been divided into chapters.
In the days of London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared at the showing of the inventor Marta Jabowski using this camp.
Hundreds of children who move to other countries have secretly been sent to a labor camp at the Texas border
The number of children moving abroad has increased and even crossed the border over the month, perhaps because of fear and a point introduced by the Trump government that has made it difficult to deliver children to the helpers.
Traditionally, many relief workers have moved to another land without signs, and they are afraid to sacrifice their privilege of living in the country when they come to need a child to help.
The problem was increasing in June, while the authorities announced that those who want to be the prime minister and other adult members of their families should present their fingers, and that they have shared these with the officials in charge of the entry and exiting of the people.
At the end of the Sabbath, Matthew Albence, the head of Immigation and Customs Enforceing, testified before Congress that the council had assembled many people who had registered to assist these children who had come on their own.
The council later concluded that 70 percent of those arrested had no history of handling cases.
"About 80 per cent of those who are assisted or members of their family are in the country, and most of these are foreigners with a history of trial.
Therefore we continue to hunt these people," says Albence.
In an effort to help the children, the authorities have set up new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their custody, not after 60 days, as they already did, according to sleep staff.
Many will appear by means of a television station, rather than through a specific method, by requiring their request to the judge of the country.
Those who may seem unworthy of help will be promptly restored to their homeland.
If children have a long period of sleep, they may experience anxiety or disappointment, which may result in violence or escape, according to the social workers who have been on the run in recent months.
Democracy is said to be growing in a large area such as Tornillo, while signs of child suffering are often ignored because of the size of such areas.
They have also added that bringing children to places where there is little time to prepare them or to hang around with others can be painful, which many have long suffered.
Syria tells ‘ an army on the US, France, and Turkey to leave quickly
In speaking to the UN General Assembly the Foreign Minister Wald al-Moualem, he also invited the Syrian refugees to come home, even in the eighth year.
Mouelem, who is next to Chief Minister, said that these foreign troops were illegal, falsely charged against terrorism, and ‘ they will be punished equally.'
"It should leave immediately without saying everything," he said at the meeting.
Mouelem insisted that "the war against terrorism is nearly over" in Syria, where 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He also said that Damascus would continue ‘ fighting this holy war until we had rid the regions of Syria, ’ both of the guerrilla groups and of the “unauthorized foreigners. ”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially teachers and trainers of Kurdish and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on active duty in a war - torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moses said that it was right for them to return, and he had condemned the ‘ other western countries ’ because the ‘ empty flood of fear ’ has kept the refugees from wanting to return.
"We have asked for foreign and relief agencies to help those who want to return," he said.
"It includes politics in an issue that should be a matter of public concern."
The United States and the European Union say that there will no longer be a solution to the rebuilding of Syria until there is a political alliance between Assad and opposition to the war.
The UN secretary - general says that the recent cooperation between Russia and Turkey to establish a final security site has a large number of Iddib revolutions offered an opportunity to continue political debates.
The cooperation between Russia and Turkey has prevented the terrible persecution of the Syrians, who are supported by Russia’s three million inhabitants.
Mouelem, however, insisted that this link is “the last time of the end, ” I would point out that the soldiers would only strike the big bangs, including the Nusra Front troops connected with Al-Qaeda, who will be "cut off."
UN servant Staffan de Mistura expects to hold the first meeting of a new government committee as well as opposing members to resolve the laws of Syria after the war and lay down a legal solution to the decision.
Mouelem has discussed the status of the Syrian government to the committee, saying that its mission must be to "remark out the documents of this country," and to warn those who want to interfere with the work.
Why Trump’s Second Step
With that opinion, A Trump will be chosen in 2020 elections only if, as many observers are expecting, judgment and crime will end his leadership prematurely.
In what may be like "The most amazing end of leadership!."
From this point on, there are no symptoms of burnout.
Since 2014, night viewing programs have doubled to 1.5 million in CNN and about three to 1.6 million in MSNC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million night viewers, ranging from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC "Relie Madow Show" has a number of long and 3.5 million scenes on the major news night.
"This is a problem that is brought to people because we do not understand it," said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama "Desigated Survival," concerning the secretary - general who becomes president after the destruction of Capitol.
Nell Scivell, a former comical writer and author of the "Just the Funding Units: An An Award attributes About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another idea.
They remember the time they took up a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would hire Mr. Trump.
Why?
She said, "Because she makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is a pleasant atmosphere in this setting.
In fact, unlike any television program, Washington’s programs can tell you about the future of Roe v. Wade, whether foreign families are able to reunite and the world’s economy.
Silence is a precious resource that observers can enjoy.
In fact, it continues to be the best - informed citizen you find in the six - hour interviewing team of experts as to how Bob Woodard uses the "deep History" to obtain his book "Fear," a $15,000 - shaped leather garment of Paul Manafort (" full of pride, said The Washington Post) and the meaning of the scientific explanation of the body parts of Stormy Daniels to the Trumps, um.
I, by one, will never see Super Mario any more.
"One of the things they do is that they give you something to watch about every night," says Brent Montgomerary, director of the Whelhouse Intertament and maker "Pawn Stars," in the series of the Trumps and daily events (to choose war with NFL, to appreciate Kim Jong-un).
If you have lost only one assignment, you are left alone.
When I arrived at the Fleiss this week, there were 50 degrees north of his house in Kauai, but he was very busy inside the house watching MSNBC on the scene.
He was not able to give up, not the case of Brett Kavanaugh, who is preparing to meet the Senate’s Committee and the future of the Supreme Court, which is based on the outcome.
"I remember where we made all the confessions in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," the Fleiss told me to do so.
"I think it was just a joke, but it seems true."

A large portion of money is being used to support midlife schemes of counselors
It is not surprising that the 17th class of Pennsylvania is seeing the use of more money, thanks to the reopening of legal establishments that allowed two people to compete in the same seat.
The recent revision of the Pittsburgh district map allows Conor Lamb who represents the Democrat party to buy its share - who also won its seat in another region in a recent special election.
A Lamb contends with another member of the Republican movement, Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th - century state of Pennsylvania, which is in full line with the 17th century.
The map was changed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after it was decided in January that the former sections were changed in favor of the Republican movement.
Competition in this new sector has introduced greater financial spending on the park between the major economic groups, the DM Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The Lamb's name became a popular name in Pennsylvania after a little won in a special election that was seen in the 18th case of Pennsylvania.
For the next ten years, this region has been occupied by the Republican movement, and President Donald Trump had won the province with 20 pounds.
Political experts have given Democrats a small measure of success.
U.S. Penitentiary El Salvador
The diplomas say that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already begun to work with Beijing, with no great restrictions from Washington.
A Trump had lovingly held a meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until fellows had removed the Trump Congregation.
Government officials have decided to invite American executives who serve in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent taxes that no longer understand Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the minister of the department, said in his opening remarks in this month.
But it is estimated that it is in El Salvador, which has received nearly $140 million donations from the United States in 2017, including drug, development, and economic support.
Such discipline, which includes economic sanctions and abscesss and abscess in Central America, would have been very painful to many unemployed people as well as to many deaths.
While the midweek meetings were running smoothly, officials in North and Central America stopped holding a convention in hopes that it would be held later that described protection and wealth to follow the same convention last year that seemed to be a step forward in overcoming immigrants in the United States.
But by mid - September, the adjacent authorities indicated that they wanted the conference to progress, and right away any idea of punishment was administered in El Salvador.
Next, President Mike Ponce, now planning a meeting, was scheduled in mid - October to emphasize the importance of the convention, as the delegates said.
And three American delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House of Bolton refused to answer to the arguments presented by three American officials, including two generals, who agreed to discuss internal matters in a private manner.
Their accounts have been confirmed by the foreign experts who are near the management and have said this in a mystery way.
Learn From History
The next article that would follow might be the release of a report by Robert Mueller regarding the Cruff’s abuses of justice, which is now evident in human writings.
Mueller says he is also searching to see if the Trump camp had joined Russia in disturbing our votes.
When the Parliament changes leadership, the Trumps will find themselves faced with questions to answer to that council, just as they are preparing to meet with their husbands again, perhaps at the end of a civil court.
There are many questions to answer, and I don’t mean that the suffering of the Trumps cannot be avoided even in the same way as those of Europe.
There are choices that all of us in all parts of the U.S. can make that affect the duration of the war.
In 1938 the German authorities were ready to conspire against Hitler, unless the West rejected him and supported the Czech population in Munich.
We failed, and we missed out on the chance to escape the terrible years that followed.
What happened in the past is based on this unique history, and the policy of democracy can be rushed or delayed by these.
Americans face a number of these conditions right now.
What should we do if the Trumps have removed the office of Rod Rosenstein II from the Chief Justice, who supervises Mueller’s research?
During the past year, Rosenstein had been in serious trouble since the paper said that he had also proposed a clandestine portrayal of the president and that the president was not qualified for responsibility.
Rosenstein notes that The Times is wrong.
"How will we answer if a recent request at F.B.I. is to investigate the case of Brett Kavanough is not enough or unfair or if it has been proved to be a judge in the Supreme Court even if there is enough evidence of rape and lying?
And above all, will we hire lawyers who will make Trump answer to his charges?
If we fail to meet these requirements, it will take a long time for theocratic encouragement to arrive at our destination.
But I hope we never fail, as a result of the education I had received in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who had been transferred to Auschwitz and the same Nazi government that used to live in my military home.
She survived and moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to burn the Sabbath on a table with the signs of the swastika.
Having such an inheritance, how can I lose hope for the future? ’

Graham Dorrans, a Ringers team player, believes that he can succeed in his team games and the Rapid Vienna team
Ragers is playing at the door with the Rapid Vienna La IV team, following the similarities to the Spanish Vallarreal team at the beginning of this month, the Ragers must win the Australian team, which will allow them to go to the second class of European scholars's League.
Graham Dorrans, who plays in the middle, has prevented him from playing his first games in the box until the day he compared the force of the Villarrea team with 2 to 2, but he believes that Ragers can use the games as a good start.
"The point we have found was necessary for us because Villarreal is a good team," said a 31- year- old expert.
"We went into the stadium believing that we could be good at the games and have found a single score.
Or at the end of the day, we may have won those battles, but in a short time, the likes of strength were things of no value.
They did well in the first stage, and we did well in the second, and we played well that day.
The Thursday is a major event in the UEFA contest.
Happily, we can take all three points, but they will be a very difficult game because they won the game but take our greeting and I hope that we can stand up and win the game.
Last year it was very difficult, to sit in my injuries and other changes in the team, but now things are in place.
Sports can be fun and exciting for boys and girls alike; recreation is wholesome.
Maybe we can stop right now, letting go of the past so that we can do it well."
Women do not sleep because they are afraid of making money at work
Although those involved in the survey had a clear idea of how to seek attention, few are talking to their brothers about this.
Nearly half of those who did research in Navowed said they were talking to their wives about the value of extended care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
‘ People want their relative to care, but they don’t take steps to talk about it, ’ said Holly Snyder, second president of the National Biology Institute.
Here is how you can begin.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family for your needs if you don’t give in.
Work together with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you should receive attention, as decisions may be needed to determine the cost.
Ask your guide for financial support: Your mentor can also help you find a way to pay your bills.
Your budget may include a long - term social insurance, a valuable life insurance policy to support these funds or to establish insurance for yourself and your resources if you have money.
Write down your legal agreements: Put legal agreements in perspective.
Have a health - care provider instead of choosing a trusted health professional to monitor your health care and to make sure that experts follow your wishes if you cannot speak.
On the other hand, think about what is involved in your financial situation.
You can choose a reliable person to replace your financial choices and make sure that your debts are paid if you cannot afford them.
Don’t forget: Suppose your elderly parents are getting very sick and are going to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about health and life - threatening health?
Take these steps as a form of preparation:
"It’s not only money that should be made, but who are the stores? "Ask Martin.
‘ What are his treatments?
Who will care for the dog?
Be prepared for that.."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by devastating earthquakes and tsunamis that devastated Plu in Indonesia on Friday, and this number of deaths is expected to rise.
As a result of the damage to the joint system, relief authorities were unable to receive much from the Dondilaa region, a region in the north of Palu, not far from a powerful quake of 7.5 seconds.
More than 16,000 people were deported after the disaster.
Here are many more about Palu and Don’twia, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is a large city in the Central Sulawesi region, located at the end of a small coastal plain on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which is about 379,800 people in 2017.
The event marked the 40th anniversary of that event.
Donilaa is an area of more than 300 miles [300 km] on the northwest coast of Sulawesi.
This region, located at the base of the region, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are particularly important to the Central Sulawesi economy, especially the region on the side of Donilia.
Nickel mines are also used in this region, but they are widely available in Morowali, a port opposite Sulawesi.
Dog and Donilaa have experienced several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Research Council.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and damaged hundreds of homes in Don’tlaa
Tsunami also took place in western Don’tlia in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the Gulf of the Pacific and is often involved in earthquakes.
Create a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The major earthquake off the western coast of Aceh in Indonesia north of Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of devastating earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds had died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A strong earthquake occurred in southern Java, an Indonesian island that caused a tsunami on the south coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: 7.6 Great earthquakes struck near Padang, capital of the West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 - magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Monttawai, near Sumatra, and triggered a ten - foot [10 m] tsunami that destroyed nearly 300 villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Small earthquakes hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing devastation and terror because people had been reminded of the earthquake and tsunami that killed so many in 2004.
No tsunami had begun, but more than 100 homes fell on them.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian mainland island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of homes and left thousands of visitors suffering temporary hardships.

Government judges seek victims of NYC crimes receive a strange ruling of death
Judges in New York City want the Syphullo Saipov to receive a death sentence, where they are charged with NYC criminal activity and killing eight people — a strange decision that has not been handed down by a government court since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is said to have used a loan car in Home Decot to be a criminal on a bicycle road near the West Side Highway of Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In determining the merit of the death penalty, judges must testify that Saipov ‘ deliberately ’ had killed the eight people and ‘ knowingly and ‘ deliberately ’ had caused serious injury to others, according to the law concerning this decision, passed to the Southern District in New York.
All such cases are punishable by death, according to a court order.
A few weeks after the trial, the high court found Saipov guilty of 22 cases involving eight assassinations, deliberate court justices, and violent crime and car damage.
The case ‘ was carefully prepared and considered, ’ the judges said, explaining how Saipov had been guilty of a case in which he was "fearful, cruel, and highly regarded."
"Sayfullo Habibillaev's Saipov had hurt others, and it was also a pity for the brothers and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decake, Darren Draj, Hernan Ferrachi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the appeal to the decision has been made.
Five of those affected were visitors from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York handed down a death sentence.
The judge, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the decision of a death resolution in New York City was the year 1953 to the Juliuss and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to the Soviet Union during the Choop or Cold War two years ago.
A married couple in the Rosenberg family were killed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no interest in what he did in the following days and months, according to court documents.
They told the researchers that they felt better about what they had done, and the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that they had been encouraged to do this after seeing ISIS films on his phone, according to more of his case.
He also requested that we show the IIS flag in his hospital room, and the police did.
He refused the 22 court cases.
A David Pattton, one of the Saipov representatives, said that he was "swallowed" by the election of the state’s judges.
"We think that the idea of accepting a death sentence rather than accepting an appeal to stay in prison and having no opportunity to be released may add to the grief to everyone involved," says Patton.
The Saipov lawyers had already asked the judges not to punish the death penalty.
MP that NIGEL FARGE should oversee Bexit discussions
Nigel Fage has promised that he will gather a class of people like warships today in the parades at the General Assembly.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should be ‘ forced ’ from EU Opponents - as one of Theresa May's counselors said that it is necessary to supervise discussions with the EU.
Peter Bone, a backler, told the people in Birmingham that the UK ‘ had gone out ’ as long as the Falle was the Secretary in the Buxit conferences.
But the challenge that May mother faces in restoring territories has been proved by the Brexitists to participate in a campaign against Bexit in the city.
He is trying to maintain a positive stand against the Brethren, the EU, and the EU.
His colleagues insisted that they continue trying to maintain contact with the Brussels despite encountering opposition - and forcing the EU Opponents and the Labor Party to choose between what they give and what they give.
A Bone had told a conference with the theme Exodus means From Solihull that he wanted to 'constitute the Brexit Constituents'.
He also said that he would have to take part and speak with the Brussels.
'If it had been the way he directed the matter, we would have gone out here,' he said.
MP of Wellinkóught added: 'I help the Brexits but we would like to oppose the Anti-Bexit League.'
In his defense against the EU, he said: ‘ We have not fought the world’s wars to become slaves.
We want to make our laws in our own country.'
A Bone rejected the theories that human thinking has changed since vote 2016: 'It is not true that Britain has changed their minds and wants to remain.'
The Brexier Andrea Jenkyns was also on the show, telling the press: 'I just say, Chief Lord, listen to the people.
‘ Living in the EU is not sought by men, the Opponents cannot accept this, nor do we need our organization and the fighting forces that fight hard for our choice.
Please leave to EU and begin listening to the people.'
To Mother May, she added: The elders as prime minister keep their duties as they fulfill their promises.'
Fage told the audience that the politicians should be ‘ forced' if they are dishonest in the 2016 tax.
Now it is a trustworthy article between us - people - and our political party, she said.
'He tried to be disloyal in the case of Brexit, and we are here to tell them that 'we don't let you do this''.'
In his message to the excited group he added: ‘ I want you to force our politicians, who have questionable ideas on the Bexit subject.
'We' draw the national group together as a war against Bexit and we will not rest until we become a independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.'
In the meantime, the EU has passed through Birmingham before holding an assembly of two hours in the center of the city.
Several opposers raised posters that the Prosecutor Brexit had set up this week.
The conference was opened by a member of the Labour a Lord Adonis party who ridiculed the Conservatives on the safety issues they faced and their computer program.
This is the people who tell us that they have been able to establish the IT system in the world and the entire culture in Canada including, the relatively safe limits, the free trade in Ireland,' has increased.
‘ It’s a complete joke.
There is nothing better than Brexit,' added.
Warren wants "to think seriously" on the subject of going into the president’s options
Sen's representative, Elizabeth Warren, says that he will consider the matter of attending the presidential elections after the election of November.

The Russian Grand Prix race: Lewis Hamilton’s world’s victory over Sebastian Vettel’s laws
It was clearly evident that Valtter Bottas had defeated Lewis Hamilton on Saturday of the game in another paragraph that the Mercedes team's rules had a part on all the latter steps.
From the beginning, Bottas had a successful career, and Hamiliton had won the entire stadium and had called Vettel to compete with his team partner.
Vettel took the lead in the race organizing, which led to Hamilton's running behind, and failed to win.
Mercedes later came out of Vettel, but Hamilton moved on after moving on wheels that had made the driver Ferrari free from the danger back to protect the third.
Max Verstappen had started from the back of the walk and was seven at the end of his first birthday.
He then led the main section of the contest where he seized his tires so that he could finish with zeal and find Kimi Raikkinen four times.
She later came to the 44-decker but was unable to increase her speed in the remaining eight seconds when Raikkinen took the fourth.
It is a very difficult day because Vallter had done a good job on weekends and was a real person to be honest.
The team has done a very special job to have two winners, says Hamilton.
Not an Illiterate Use of Cosmetics
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday convention for urging him not to issue a letter from Christine Blesey Ford to testify to the Supreme Court’s Supreme Court on immorality.
In a speech at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly present the evidence given by the Fords before the Senate Committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate is proving that people are being "haught and frightened and lying."
"The only thing that can happen and the best thing that can happen in the last few days is that, if you see anger, you will see people who are angry and angry but who are afraid and who lie, ” he said.
"Look at the hidden news from the criminal, but when you hear "iii, I haven't done this.
I did not do this.."
Do You Recall?
Did Dianne Feisstein, have you put them out in public?
Recalling his reply... that you had brought it out in public - "iiii, yes, what?
No, it does not.
I did not go out in public.."
Well, let us say so.
We took them out in public?...
A Feinstein was sent to an address on the Kavanaugh case that had been addressed by the Ford in July of last July, and the matter was openly exposed in September - but Feinstein denied that the circulation would come from their office.
"I haven't stolen anything from the Ford, I did not reveal it in public," the Feinstein told the Senete Committee according to the newspaper The Hill.
"She told me to be a secret matter and I kept a secret."
This refusal did not please the president of the country, who spoke on Saturday as such: "I assure you, this was not a good way to speak with gestures.
It may not have been, but it was an unclean way of speaking through the body’s signs that I had seen.'
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court, the prosecutor accused him of having relations with three women, the president argued that the Democrats were using their arguments to achieve their ends.
"The goal is to regain power through this method.
You find these men to be very timid, anxious, indifferent to the victim’s attempts to usurp power, ” said the director, according to the Mediaite newspaper.
Main Ball Entrant: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer used two Giant bands against Dundee
The Dundee Stars team reacted in a vendetta when it defeated the Belfast Giants team and 5 to 3 kW in the football game on their previous Day.
The Belfast Giants team conducted a series of lectures by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
But through Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie and Dwyer of the Belfast Giant team, the team led the team.

It was a very busy opening time, when Sullivan returned the contestants at 13:10, Matt Marquardt before granting Cownie the right to the yoke that gave the team the same yokes of similar loads at 15:16.
Dwyer encouraged the Giants team for the first time to breathe when he played the second part of the night game at the end of the first time.
The Dundee team at their door came up with another idea, and Bouchard made a powerful line at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran had played a professional game to the Nielsen who had given the Dundee to the team for the first time to lead the team to the end of the second stage and had added to the additions that brought all the five to the games.

Experts calculate what happens until the mother was burned alive
The prosecutor closed the case on Saturdays for the murder of Mississippi’s living wife in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in making an intelligent examination.
He had explained to the court how he had used the right telephone to involve the conduct of 29 - year - old lawyer Quinton Tellis and 19 - year - old victim Jessica Chambers, who had died.
Rowlett said that he had received more about land from several mobile telephones who showed Tellis that Tellis had Chambers at the end of the night, which is contrary to what he had said earlier, Clarion Ledger said.
When he was shown that his phone had held Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified that Saturday was not a city that day.
When the judges asked if Tellis was right when he said he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said he was ‘ lying, because my car was in Nashville right away. ’
Another disagreement is that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after his death.
The evidence from right phones indicates that they get to know each other for just a week.
Rowlett states that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed the Chambers ’ writings, most of them playing with his name on his phone.
"Adam took it out of his life," said Hale.
The opposer is expected to present his final opposition on Sunday.
The judge said that he was waiting for the trial to come to court that day.
The High Breed: What is the top beat of the hip tap?
Three others who play the harp are considering the change of the erroneous way in which a message of encouragement is transmitted in their songs.
The High Breed movement from Bristol, which has become a symbol of war, was no longer involved in the so - called political and social development of the day.
The group’s feelings and accredits to the spirit of the song begin to behave as they did in the past.
Songers such as The Fuges and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK through musicians such as Kala and Lowkey.
A black man?
A child - care worker in NY is blaming a family for sending a message of "supplication"
A child - care worker at NY blames one family for sending a message of prejudice after receiving a missing message from the mother complains that she was "a black man."
The family disagrees with prejudice, saying that the case is like “a way of stealing."
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was disappointed to learn that this new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when he arrived on his first day of labor in 2016.
"IISIIII IS AN MORNING MAN," said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxmato in a letter to her husband.
However, instead of sending the letter to her husband, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
Recognizing her mistake, the "Davour" Plasco-Flaxm resigned from office with Sister Maurice, saying that she was the former director of their children, who was a native of Africa-Americans, had done a horrible job and instead expected to find a person from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received a full - time job and then was sent home to Uber.S.
Now Maurice is blaming the couple for losing their job, and she wants to pay as much as $350 a day for six months, before the contract begins.
"I want to show them, see, you don't do things this way," he told Post Friday and added, "I know it is prejudice."
Uwe had defended himself against prejudice, saying that removal of Maurice was the wise thing to do, fearing that he would not trust him if he disappointed him.
‘ My wife had sent something for her that she didn’t want to say.
He is not prejudiced.
We are not prejudiced," man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Can you, though, deliver your children into the hands of the one whom you have mistreated, even though it was not the will of you?
Your new child?
You people.."
Comparing the case to “a method of theft, ” Plasco said that his wife was only two months behind birth and was“ in the most difficult times.."
"Can you go out to fight the person in the situation?
It is not the best thing to do," a banker added.
While the case is still in place, the light court has enthusiastically rebuked the family for their actions and feelings.
The publishers of Paddington fear that readers cannot imagine the wild beast that is talking, a new letter reveals this.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born after the book was approved, said of the letter: "It’s hard to believe someone else instead of the person who reads the book before being released.
It is a joy to know now what we know of the great success of Paddington’s book.
Regarding his father, the former BBC photographer before being encouraged to write a book for children and a little bear, it may have been a terror to be abandoned, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication was ‘ bitter and good ’ after her death last year.
Padding book, which is described as "the most important in our family," I add that his father was very proud that he was finally doing well.
"He was a calm man, and he was not a blasphemer," he said.
"But since Patington was real to him, it was as if you had a child who does something: you’re proud of them even if you’re not doing it.
I think he had seen how successful Paddington was.
Although it was his inventions and ideas, he always accords Paddington’s dignity.'
My daughter died, and I had to play the phone
Upon arriving, she ran with her daughter to the hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors had worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was serious, and that he didn't expect to recover," says Ednan-Lapehouse.
"Kenko received a phone call from Nad so that he would die within two minutes and I had to turn him off.
And I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you very much, my loved one.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
Her condition gradually deteriorated to the point of dying.
He had been dead for a short time, and that was just the beginning.
I had to wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I can’t cry or cry because I was in the environment surrounded by family members and others.
I had to keep them for myself.
Later Mrs. Ednan-Lapehouse, still grieving the death of her daughter, flew with other people who did not understand the problems she had.
"No one knows that," he said.
"My head was on the floor, and tears fell from my eyes all over it.
It is hard to explain, but it was on a trip that I sympathized with Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how they loved me.
Grieving mothers send cards to avoid killing themselves on the bridge
Two mothers who lost their loved ones in death are trying not to kill themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been sending cards on Welsh bridge with encouraging messages and phone numbers that can be played when needed.
Tyler, a son of Davis, was 13 years old when he began to experience anxiety and suicide at the age of 18.
‘ I don’t want any parent to hear how I feel on a daily basis, ’ he said.
Davis, a 45 - year - old mother in Lydney, said that their son had the privilege of being a good cook and smiling.
"Everyone knows her for her smile.
She is always said to have a sense of light everywhere.."
However, he gave up his job before he died, since he was in “deep trouble. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, 11 at the time, was the victim of his suicide.
“ I’m worried about the outcome, ” says Davis.
Sister Davis made the cards, "so you can go out and talk with them, even with a friend.
Don't just keep quiet - you have to talk.."
Mrs. Humphreys, a close friend of Davies, lost her husband, Mark, in death at age 15, not long after his mother died.
"She didn’t say she feels hurt or sad or anything else," she said.
‘ A few days before Christmas we have seen the change.
It wasn't very good on Christmas day - children when they opened their gifts, they didn't see or say anything."
He also said that his death was a terrible threat, but he had to endure in this regard: "Syna has left family suffering.
They separate us.
But we all need to keep enduring.

The future of Brett Kavanough is not known when the FBI began searching
"I thought, if we had found anything like anything to ask for - such as a short - term study, less - likely to bring a little unity," Flake said on Saturday, he added that he was afraid of the committee was "coming down" during a fierce political war.
Why did Kavanough and Republican followers not want the FBI to investigate?
Their refusal is based on events that were about to take place.
The average choice remains within five weeks to be met, on November 6 - so, as expected, that the Republican party will fail, and it will be too weak to try to bring a person who wants to be appointed by the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to Senator, encouraging them to assist Kavanough, who worked in White House in Bush and through him had met their secretary, Ashley.
What will happen if the FBI reports it?
There will be a show at the Senate, which has 51 republics of the Republican Union and 49 members of the Democrat movement.
It is not known whether the Kavanoughs can obtain at least 50 votes in the house of Senate, which would allow Mike Pénce, the second president, to settle the matter and convince him of the Supreme Court.
The number of revolutions ‘ dropped ’ under the guidance of Kim
The number of those from North Korea who have rebelled to become South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un was reigning seven years ago, says South Korea’s policyist.
A Park Ezeong-seg, speaking of much from the South Chief Minister's Office, said there were 1,127 last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the effective oversight of the border between North Korea and China and higher prices for exports is due to this decline.
He did not make any comment about this.
Most rebels from North Korea eventually receive a permit to become citizens of South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Korea had crossed unauthorized borders since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many have fled through China, where there is a long line of North Korea and is much easier to cross than the Demiliterated Zone (DMZ) Security Center (DMZ) between these two Korea countries.
China considers these rebels to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and is often forced to retaliate.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea has changed dramatically in the past months.
At the beginning of this month, the two leaders met at Pyongangy to discuss nuclear weapons that had previously been lost.
This occurred after the Juni special conference between the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where the two agreed to work to destroy all nuclear weapons in their Korea countries.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister R Yong-ho said that sentences from the U.S. country are a disturbing element of good manners since then.
"Unless you trust America we will not be satisfied with the security of our country and in these things it is impossible for us to begin to stop using nuclear weapons alone," RI said when speaking to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "swain," saying that I am not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
The leader with a few elementary Nancy Pelosi says He is elected to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and said he was incompetent to work at the High Court.
Pelus said this in a conversation that took place on Saturday in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't do anything, but I think that if the woman had done this, she would have said 's sister',' she said, "Pelolosi would express her opinion as to what Kavanaugh would say as a witness before the Tribunal of the Fourth Council.
Kavanough denied charges that she had been raped by Dr. Christine Blesey Ford when they were all young.
In her first words, Kavanough was very upset, sometimes shouting and angry about her family and her high school term.
He also criticized Democrats on the committee, saying that the charges against him are “a form of fear and an attempt to discredit a person's name ” by the free people who were upset that Hillary Clinton had not won the election of 2016.
Pelus said that the testimony of Kavanaugh had proved that he should not work at the Supreme Court, because it was shown to favor with the Democrats.
"I think he is putting off his job with what he says and how he speaks to Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was uncertain when she was asked if she would try to de-duct the course of a vote, and if the Democrats had found more members in the house of the Oymera.
"What I would say is true - if it is not true in Congress or the FBI, it is not necessary to be in the Supreme Court, but to be at the present court, "Polosi."
Kavanough is still a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelus added that if a member of the Democrat party was concerned with decisions that Kavanough might criticize the provision of Affordable Care Act or Roe v.Wade, as he is viewed as a Democrat political lawyer.
In his earnest obedience, the Kavanaughangh had avoided questions regarding whether he would change some decisions at the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a criminal, a liberal man to go to court and expect us to say, 'It is not good,' said Pelosi.
And women need to make good use of this method.
With righteous reproof there, months and years of wrath have come upon him, and he cannot send forth those who cry out to him.
"We cry when we are angry," Sister Steinim told me that 45 years later.
"I don’t think it’s strange, isn’t it?'
He continued, "I was very helped by an elderly woman who said that she too cried, but he made a plan to get angry and cry, and he could say to the person to whom he spoke, ‘ You can think I’m sorry because I cry.
I’m angry. "
And he keeps on going.
And I think it was a very good idea. ”
Tears are allowed as a way to express anger because tears are not completely understood.
One of my earliest memories of my first job was in this office with many men, where once I was in tears of utter anger, being caught by an elderly lady - manager who was always somewhat nervous about her - who was tempted to climb the stairs.
"Don't let these people see you cry," they told me to do so.
"I don’t know you’re upset.
She thinks you are sad and is happy that she has come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, former Democratic Congress in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in their presidential camp.
In 1987, after Hart was caught in adultery on a ship called Monkey Business, which led to his leaving the race, Schroede, who was deeply disturbed, felt that there is no reason he should have to look for a role in the contest in striving to be a president.
"He didn't choose well," he told me and laughed 30 years later.
"There were seven others who already wanted to join the race, and the last they needed was one person.
One called it "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was a flashy party, he was back in making money, and he was determined not to participate in the contest unless he had earned as much as $2 million.
This was a failure.
He found that some of the assistants who had donated $11,000 to men should give him only $250.
"Do they think I accept removal?" he is surprised by it.
When he announced that he was not setting up a special campaign, he was deeply moved by his gratitude for those who had helped him, frustrated with plans that made it difficult to find money and plans against people who were willing to vote rather than give up, and angry at the lack of respect for them.
"If you think I was in serious trouble," Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the journalists do it.
"If you think Kleex was my company’s assistant.
What would they put on my gravestone?
"She cried"?."
A look at how China can benefit from Kamba’s struggle between the country and the Americas.
At the beginning of the conflict, the conflict still rages within itself, yet the best - behaved monks have found that the flu can spread the good of China at the end of the century.
The beginning of this was when the American statesman Donald Trump set taxes on goods from China as solar power, steel, and aluminum.
The dispute seemed to have reached the plant in this week when the United States decreed that 200 billion pounds [200 billion kg] of goods, or in some other way, amounted to 150 billion items in the British colony.
China’s abuse has also been a major source of revenues to the United States by setting up their tax revenues to punish the U.S. state recently established between 5 and 10 percent of the total tax and $60 billion in terms of the American economy.
China has declared a retaliatory response to the American national policy and is now being vigilant.
To eliminate the American economy, it is necessary to cut back on China’s property and make it easier for the United States to yield openly and to bring about the dishonor it may bring upon the ruler of the country, Jinpinng.
However, some experts have suggested that the flu can sustain China for a long time by reducing the mutual trust of both countries, which may occur if China is a good choice.
"Abgail Grace, who is associated with the Center for New America Security and a specialist in Asia, says that ‘ active political initiatives have the potential to interfere with economic activities in the Americas and China as much as some think.'
Syria "is possible" for refugees to return, says the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
They are ready to return to their homeland and ask for help to rebuild a country that has been devastated by the war of more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, High Commissioner Wald al-Moualem said that things are beginning to improve in the world.
"We’re still safe and secure because of what has happened in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore what has been lost through the terrorist attacks and to improve standards of behavior.
Everything is well established for refugees to come to an end because of terrorism and the economic pressures that have affected their lives and way of life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian refugees have been displaced from the country since the war began in 2011.
The six million remaining residents of the country also need help.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian government would accept help in rebuilding this ruined land.
But he insisted that he would not receive help with other needs or aid from countries that had served the terrorist attacks.
The European team has taken the model model of the Royal Cup in Paris
The European team has taken the Ryder Cup team in 2018 after conquering the USA and 16-pounders and 10- and a half-pounders at the Le Gold National Park, outside Paris, France.
The United States has had a six - year victory at the Ryder Cup games that have been playing in European countries and that has not been the stage since 1993.
A tournament team of his fellow athletes, Thomas Bjorn, picked up the box again after winning 14.5 to win the U.S. team.
U.S. team star Phil Mickelson, who failed to show a man in the game, threw a ball into a ball in the wild, which gave him a victory for his enemy Francesco Molinari.
Italian athletes played their full-time in all these games and made him 1 out of 4 players who held 5-0 ever since the games in 1979.
American athletes, Jordan Spieth, did not faint when he gave in to 5 knapsacks for European athletes Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best - known athlete Dustin Johnson has fallen 2 and 1 in England's Ian Poulter who probably plays his final game in the Ryder Cup cap.
The Ryder Cups competition, the Specialps General Sergio Garcia, has been the most successful in Europe with 25.5 players during his career.
"I have an extra cry, but I can't do it today.
This was a very difficult year.
I am grateful to my teacher Thomas for being alone and believing in me.
I am very happy, and I am glad that I received this cup again.
The goal was for our team to win., and I am glad to have had a part in this victory," said Garcia, who looks very successful following the success of his European team.
He thanked John Ram’s fellow countrymen who won US Tiger Woods 2&1 for one and one Sunday games.
"I’m the most proud to win out over scholar Tiger Woods, where I grow up and see him playing," says Rahm, 23.
Woods won all four games in France and is now able to win the Ryder Cup race that has reached 13-2-3.
This is hard to assume that this is one of the world’s experts, who has won 14 contests and is surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The USA was struggling at the end of a week to get good results except by Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played the top sport.
U.S. executive director Jim Furyk spoke after playing a game that upsets his team, "I’m proud of these boys, working hard.
There was a time in the morning when we had trouble with the European team.
The war was a disaster for us.
Let all credit go to Thomas.
It provides a safe guide.
All 12 are trained and capable.
By making ourselves available, I can work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cyprus Committee, and we will continue to make progress.
I love all 12 of these friends, and I am proud to be their leader.
In a sense, you may need to adjust your circumstances.
We must admit that our friends played better than we.'
