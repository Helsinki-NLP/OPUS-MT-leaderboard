Members of the Assembly (AMs) of Wales are concerned about their appearance
There are an AMs concerned that it is raised to change their pronunciation into MWPs (A member of a Wales Parliament).
This has been demonstrated because plans are made to convert the convention’s name into a Welsh Parliament.
The AMs of all politics are concerned that this will result in further expansion.
The other AM of Labour says that his group is worried that the way the new name is called is close to the "Twp" and "Pwp."
To a student who does not live in Wales: Welsh tup is an idyllic language, and upp means a trophy.
The AM of the Society of Wales said that the whole organization does not like this, and has suggested in other terms.
The Conservative member in Wales says that his team is free from the change of the name, but he has seen that it is not easy to call MWP as he calls a fool.
In this case the spelling of the wh is similar to that of the English letter.
The Assembly Commission, which is engaged in creating a rule for changing the name into this new one, stated: "The resolution of the way to call the Convention Members will be taken by the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh conference permission to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public response and found that many supported the convention to be changed to the Palamante of Wales.
In the case of the AMs, the Commission prefers this: The Members of Wales Parliament or WMPs, but the people support the MWP.
The AMs is said to recommend otherwise, but that it is difficult to agree on this, it must be a problem for Elin Jones, the Executive Officer, who is expected to introduce a change in the following weeks.
This policy of reform will include other changes such as the operation of the convention, including legislation to stop the AMs and how the committee is formed.
The AMs votes that will be counted last when the law is discussed in the question of how they are named.
The Macedonians will vote to change their country’s name
The voters will vote on Sunday even if they have changed their country's name into the "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
It was designed to resolve a conflict that lasted for decades with the neighboring Greek province of Macedonia.
The Athenians have long held that the name of their neighbors in the north seems to have been in their place, and they have long been against their request to be members of the EU and the NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjogen Ivanov, who is opposed to the status of this designation, said that he no longer ignored the vote.
However, those who support this vote, including President Zoran Zaev, say that this change of name is the price they need to pay in order to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s St. Roofed Astled Churches in Harlem
Mr. Adams said: "The older people I talked to say there was a bar and a church everywhere."
"Today, none of them are."
He realized why the batteries had not yet been away.
He said: "People will have another fun" these days.
"Bari is no longer a neighborhood where people are always there."
You are concerned about the churches because you think the money they have won by selling their goods will not last as long as the leaders think, "and they will soon return to their original condition."
In addition, churches can be replaced by individual flags that will never help to keep the former local shrines.
She said: "Many people are buying the glasses by white people; so the day will soon come when the churches will be closed, because it doesn't seem that these people who move to these do are members of the churches."
Both of these churches were congregations of white people before Harlem became home to black people, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregation emerged in the 1930s.
The black congregation that had served nearby became that one.
St. Martin became a black congregation under the Cloud. John Howard Johnson, who led the truck of a merchant on 125th Street, the best - selling street in Harlem, opposed to unemployment and the lack of support for blacks.
In 989 this structure was badly damaged by fire, but as the members of Tat' Johnson were preparing to rebuild it, they were ordered to be beaten.
David Johnson, a son who succeeded Tat' Johnson in St. Martin's, called the metal beat "the steel of the suffering people."
An expert in metal beating, who beats himself, called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "a history tool that will never be taken anywhere."
The specialist, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first time in the world that the instrument was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riversside Church with more metal than 18 years ago.
Mr. Merwether said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
The main thing was St. Martin's in the past few months was the work of the architects and builders, some of whom were brought up by the leaders of non-teachers, others by the Arab church.
The congregation - administrative body, made up of nonconformists in July, is concerned that the applicants do not blame the congregation, even though this does not contribute to the work of the architects and designers.
Some Catholics complain that the plenty does not count things.
Cerebree harms a child with ster-3-year boiler to obtain lobsters in California
The officers said that the shark had attacked and injured 13 boy on Saturday, when he was sinking to catch lobster in California on the day of the annual lobster fishing season.
This attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV that she had been swimming with friends about half an hour in the morning when she heard the boy call for help. Then they rushed to her to help her get her out of the water.
Hammel said that at first I thought it was fun to hold a lobster, but later he ‘ realized that it was calling out, ‘ I’m mad!'
‘ I’m mad at me!'
This bone is below the throat on the chest, and it is clear. Hammel has noticed this when he comes to the boy.
"I shouted that everyone should get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' don't say Hammel.
The boy is taken by plane to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in serious condition.
It is not known what kind of shark it is.
A marine explorer, Kapt. Larry Giles said that when speaking in the news, the shark had been seen there a few weeks ago, but it was said that it was not a dangerous type of shark.
Next, Gils said that the victim was seriously injured in the above body.
The officers have closed the sea from Pontus Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Enyunitas for 48 hours to ensure safety.
Giles said that there are more than35 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are said to be harmless.
The Sainsbury's plans to bring its products to the UK export market
The Sainsbury's rivals the Boots, Superdrug and 7benhams by having stores equipped with specialized and professional help.
As an important means of entry into the UK' drug market, which makes up about £2,8bn, and continues to grow while fashion and household products are down, these large sections with installed facilities will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country, and they will be present at more stores in the next year to run smoothly.
The investment is due because these stores want to use empty shelves after they are accused of TV, microwaves and household items.
The Sainsbury's will increase the output of its makeup to about 3,000, including names such as Revlon, Esie, Tizezeman and Dr. Paw Paw for the first time.
Those who already have them as L'Orel, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space in places with names similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The store will also introduce the Boutique beauty products so that many are suitable for people who do not eat meat - something that the new buyers need most.
Additionally, the Fragrance Shop will test the requirements of the two Sainsbury stores, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, this week last and the second to open at Selly Oak, in Birmingham, the following year.
Having on - line shopping while people buy little food a day from a nearby store requires that they do much more to encourage people to go to them.
Mike Coup, the chief Sainsbury's chief executive, said, these stores will look like big stores with a variety of products, as they are trying to combat stores with costs such as Aldi and Lidl for more services and other non-finas.
The Sainsbury's has placed the Argos in many stores and has started with the Habitas because it bought them both two years ago. This has increased the demand for food and made profits.
The efforts of this former company to improve branch and medical facilities have failed.
Her Sainsbury's tried to contact the Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but they separated after fighting in a way of dividing the drug profits from their stores.
This new plan exists after the Sainsbury's sold Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy’s drug companies for 281 drugged by £125m, three years ago.
It says that Lloyds will also participate in this plan, by increasing the quality - quality flattening products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the business manager at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance of the sheets with our equipment to improve our customers.
We have made money from highly educated people so that they can be successful in giving advice.
The variety of products we have are designed for every need, making it easier for a person to obtain a place where it is available, is now an interesting component and is quite different from the way of the old purchase.
Peter Jones is angry because Holly Willoughby has quit £11 billion business
Peter Jones is known in the Dragons Den after the driver Holly Willoughby quit the £11 billion life - production industry to deal well with the new agreements he has with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their house products and decorations like Truly.
The trade of this second was likened to the Gwyneth Packrow's Goop product.
The This Morning, with 37, put it on Instagram as if you are moving.
Holly Willloughby left famous in the Dragons" Den, Peter Jones became angry because he came out of the production industry of life - so that he could better manage his new connections with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones has been “gried ” when a special TV girl admits to a hot meeting on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, if her new contracts are reaching £1.5 million - enough time to take care of household products and decorations such as Truly.
This business is compared to the Gwyneth Patrow's Goop product and has received the money to double Willoughby's budget estimated to be £11 million.
As Wiloughby, the 37th year, had put in Instagram that he left Truly, Jones went to one of his vacation homes in Britain.
The source said: "Truly has been the most important thing to Holly.
It will be his destiny for a long time through the next decade.
His decision to abandon him was a personal one.
None of us would believe what happened on Tuesday, near the festival of dedication.
There is a restaurant full of material at Marlow HQ that is ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the Thirds Morning evangelist, one of Britain’s most lucrative people, would cost the company millions of dollars because of growing heavy cash from products from beams and candles to goods and household goods, and things that could be even more slow to delay its establishments.
And this can mean the end of long - standing friendships.
The mother of three Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Wiloughby established Truly with Cappp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two go to vacation together, and Jones has 40 percent of their assigned assignments on the Baldwin's TV company.
Willoughby will be the executive director of this M&S agency and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I TV driver, I'm A Celebrity.
The next source to Jones has said last day, "We will not talk about his business affairs."
We talked a lot and ‘ spread our love to each other'
He has been criticized for the criticism that he has often received by the media about what others consider to be "futile" and by speaking positively about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such a sacrifice?
Trump said in his derogatory voice that "the journalist on the policy."
"I don't need anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting again after her first meeting in Singapore in June that a captivated by Trump was given as a major step toward the nuclear end in North Korea.
But the nuclear peace pact has ended.
More than three months after the June conference in Singapore, North Korea’s senior executive R Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN on Saturdays of the House of Assembly that the North does not see "a similar answer" from the United States to North Korea on activities of disarmament.
Rather, he said that the United States continued its own focus on suppressing it.
Trump has given hope of a talk he gave at his feast.
"We're doing well in North Korea," said.
"We were fighting North Korea.
Millions would also be killed.
Now we get to know one another very well.."
He has said that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim and to produce the best of tests, resulting in the release of victims and restoration of the bones of American soldiers.
And he has protected Kim’s mind from some unusual get - rich - quick conversation.
"It is very easy to be the presidents, rather than 10,000 people outside trying to enter this full stadium would be about 200 people standing here," Trump pointed out to the crowd standing right before him.
The Indonesian and Nykima Tunami, destroying the Island, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, nongovernmental organizations were told that they did not need it.
Even if 10 percent of the Lomboks were removed from the area, the area was not declared a place of disaster, which would result in the aid of the world.
"Unfortunately, in most cases, they have made it clear that they are not asking for the help of the world, so this is a challenge," Nszn Sumung said.
While the Save the Children gathers a group to go to Palu, they are still uncertain whether foreign workers can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster center, said that Indonesian authorities are examining the situation in Palu to see if the world’s agencies will be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
As a result of an earthquake frequented Indonesia, this country has always been less suitable for earthquakes.
While tsunamis are being built in Aceh, some coastal areas are rare.
The absence of a tsunami alarm in Palu, though warned against it, may have contributed to the death of people.
Even in quieter times, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make travel even more difficult.
A hospital ship burst out of Lombok to rescue victims of an earthquake into Palu, but it will take at least three days before it reaches the scene of this new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo put the foundation of the deteriorating Indonesian development at the cost of election support, and he has spent a lot of money on repairing railroads and rails.
But poor funding has struck Mr. Joko as it is to be reelected in the next year.
Yet, Mr. Joko is facing the pressures of the Indonesian sects, where many Muslim members have taken a stand on the main issue of this religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands have been forced to leave their homes as teams of Christians and Muslims fight on the streets using knives, knives, and other dangerous weapons.
Consider: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool made a large measure of reference against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge has saved Liverpool from eating at the Premier League by Chelsea by working on a 9th - minute Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.

The ball even passed through the crooked Kepa Arzágagaga and fell to the landn.
"I was trying to go to this place, and players like Shaq always forward as best I can, so I have tried to make as much time as possible," says Sturridge in LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw to help Kante go down once and without a lot of thought."
The Chelsea led by 1-0 in the first half after working in the 25th of the Belgium vessel Eden Hazard.
... The Blues Department with a short foothold sent it to Matthew Kovacic before sending it near the middle of the stadium and going to the side of Liverpool half.
Kovacci immediately quit playing on his belly.
He loaded his sling and whirled it over his head until it fairly whistled.
Hazard has left all the sterns to the spring which was a great shock to the past Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
The Liverpool plays with the Napoli on the Champions League in 3 p.m. on Wednesday in Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meets the Videon in UEFA Europe Legage by 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.

It is reported that many people were trapped under a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and caused waves to rise to 20 feet, Sutopo Pzowu Nugroho, who told the news service.

The police arrested a 32 - year - old man, who was charged with murder after a woman was beaten and died
A search to kill was started after a woman’s body was discovered at Birkenhead, Merseyside, that morning.
This 44 - year - old woman was found 7,55am with wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police have urged people in the area to see or hear anything if they have come forward.
Journalist Brian O'Hagan said: 'The research is still in its early stage but I urge anyone in the John Street area of Birkenhead to see or experience anything that might be suspicious to contact us.
Yet I would like to urge anyone, especially taxis, that they may have anything with dashcam to contact us as you might have important information.'
The police spokesman made sure that a woman found her body in Birkenhead had been found inside the property.
Well, relatives who think they know ‘ have come to this lonely place to ask questions about the place where this morning was found.
The investigation continues as the police try to introduce neighboring relatives to the victim.
The prosecutor who lives in Grayson Maws has recently tried to return to his chart but has been informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
She was below hearing what had happened.
Now the people were told that they would be allowed several hours later to return inside.
The police should report to one man that the area is already considered a crime area.
A woman comes to the place where she runs.
It always repeats the words 'It’s too bad'.
By 22pm the two vans of the police were in this line and the one outside just a little.
A number of policemen stood outside the border at the checkpoint.
Any detail is asked to make DM@MerPolCCC, to attract 180 or communicate with the Crimestepers which do not specify at 0000 555 111 for 247 logs of 30th September.
Cromwell’s model is the last to be discovered by ‘ a re - creation of history.
Their removal will be the righteousness of the universe because of its arsonlike destruction in much of England’s traditional and religious images practiced by his devout Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell described Mr Crick's advice as "foolishness" and " tried to edit history again."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It would be inevitable that in this discussion there is the removal of images if the photograph of Orever Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster is a target.
The destruction of images in the English wars has not been forbidden by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell will be given for the actions of his grandfather Thomas of the past century.
The beautiful way Sir William Hammo Thornycroft described Cromwell is a testimony to 19th - century concepts and part of the history of many who still think that his life should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is generally considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than by now, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, especially in his case the pressure from the state.
Whether this definition is correct depends on the debate of current history.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has influenced the development of our next country, and Cromwell is one who has identified himself as one who stands on the side of the conflict.
What he does as Lord the Protector must be celebrated and remembered."
A Deadly Rat Attack on China’s Farming
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a donkey in a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
A man, described only by his surname "Juan," was found dead with a broken vein, covered with blood near a herd of pigs in the Cuuppanshui province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post, reported on Sunday.
A herd farmer arranges for his donkeys to be picked up at a peg on May 30, 2005 at Cing in Qinghai Province, China.
She is said to have been accompanied by her cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and she found that the door to the nearby herd of pigs was wide open.
He says that there was a big pig with blood in the mouth.
The service research confirmed that the hefty weight of 550 pounds caused her to kill the mother, according to the report.
"The feet of the cousin were blood and twisted," said the relative whose name is "Wu," as quoted by Guiging Evening News.
security cameras showed Yuan to enter the market by 4.40 I on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The tiger killed Juan, not his own or that of his own family.
The business manager told the Evening News that the dog had been locked up to avoid assault on other people, while the police were gathering the witness at a police station.
Yuan’s family and the commercial authorities are said to talk about the reward of his death.
Though few in number, the situation in which pigs are exposed is more likely to attack people in the past.
In 2016, the tiger attacked the sixth man and his husband on their farm in Massachusetts, a man who suffered severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 600 - weight shark seized the Welsh farmer from trachthari until his wife chased him away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that the dogs did not feel angry, but their blood pressure may cause them to do so.
It’s just a game.
They are there, overloaded... with no intention of harming them.
You have to give the appropriate one, say.

More than 20 million people had watched the 4 - body testimony performed by the High Court elect Bret Kavanaugh and the defendant accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blesey Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the state of the political state continues, with a circulation that interferes with the planning of the fifth routine to change at the last minute: a contract made by the Arizona of Senen Jeff Flake so that the FBI will carry one week’s research into the case.
Ford has told the Senate Committee to ensure 100 percent of the fact that Kavanaugh had put his finger under the influence of alcohol and tried to free him from a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a body-proofed evidence, you have made sure of 100 per cent if that was not possible.

The company counted the number of followers on the news of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers have not been present at this moment to be seen in some businesses, including PSS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And nielsen has a number of people who have watched in offices.
To put it in the case, it is the corresponding number of followers and when the finish line is seen in ball games or the Service Department.
The Information Exotor, whose opinion is to have a system supporting the election of Kavanaugh with power, led all others on the network by having 5.69 million adherents at the time of the flooding throughout the day, says Nielsen.
ABC was at the second quarter of 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, says Nielsen.

"I stand here in front of you," said the yellow man.
"Do you think you are telling the truth in the country?
She was told, "You are strong when most of the sailors are not strong."
Flake said that his office had pulled out the apartment and that, before closing it, he had much to say to the counsel committee.
the media and cables were distributed at the same time in the following hours, while the Executive Committee would vote to continue the election of Kavanaugh in the full vote chart.
But Flake said that she would do so only by keeping up with the FBI where she would look at the charges against the choice for the next week, where the Democrats were few groups advised.
Folake has suggested this by speaking with her relative, The Democratic Master, Chris Coos.
After talking to Coons and other satellites, Folake made the decision.
Flake’s choice is powerful, for there is evidence that the Ribs do not vote to accept Kavanauh without doing research.
President Trump opened the FBI inquiry to find out the charges made by Kavanaugh.

Their method of playing and control has not usually changed what they have returned from a standard aircraft, but they are given credit to the Holt by the way he played the team game that he came to.
He had much to be proud of.
The leader of the team Halket has a body, which pursues the sub-projecting of the software, while Menga maintains the Conor Goldson and Joe Warral at all times.
The Ragers needed more support.
Although they had been very good at times under Gerard, they had fallen far beyond the decks.
Their last football was only one short time in which they gave them a home-in-and-so, which was an exciting experience for the Ragers, which they found in the center of the table.

Hundreds in Indonesia were affected by an earthquake, a Tsunami appearing to have a growing circle
At least 384 people were killed, many were killed and drowned away from the massive waves in the seas, where a great earthquake and tsunami had hit Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were assembled at a platform in the Pacific Ocean in a five - foot [6 m] middleway where the high waves (18 feet) fell on dry ground, destroying people because they killed a large number of people and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami follows 7.5-inch conditions.
"When the tsunami promises to appear yesterday, people have been doing their jobs at sea and have not fled and ended up being victims," Sutopo Pzowu Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of the BNPB, spoke very well when giving a comment to Jakarta.
"Stunami never went alone, pulling cars, buildings, houses, selling everything on earth, said Nugroho, never said that the tsunami was traveling by open sea at 800 kph (47 mph) before coming to shore.
Some people climb trees because they try to avoid a tsunami and get away safely, as it were.
About 6,700 persons were driven from their homes to 24 Pallu stations.
The Aerial photoography has been released by a committee of emergency services showing many buildings and stores destroyed by tsunamis, bridges that have fallen and watered mosques.
The fruit of the tsunami has continued to move the city coast on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes are confined to an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Ministry of Technology (BPPT) has said in its speech that the greatest earthquake was more than 200 times more powerful than a nuclear explosion cast into Hiroshima in the Second World War.
Scientific science in City, which remains at the end of the length, closes the harbor, can increase the size of the tsunami, says.
You have described the damage as the big one, and you have said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims have been found trapped under a ladder of broken buildings, said, and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 have not yet been seen.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage were as large as 200 miles (1900 km) in the North Pacific, the place called Dongla, and the nearest to the earthquake stop.
The link was totally silent from Dongla, Nugho said.
More than 300,000 people living there, said the Red Cross in their speech, added that their crew and volunteers had headed to the affected areas.
"It’s already a disaster, but it can be better", says.
The Aronte on Saturday was widely criticized for not avoiding the tsunami of Palu, although the officers had come to the tide at the time of warning.
Photos of people who are still studying have been shared on chat rooms where a man was over the floor of a building that had been heard sounds warning of despair when the tsunami reached people and on the streets below.
Within minutes the water wall has hit the shore and took buildings and cars away.
The Reuters could not pass that image on immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have created tremendous power for the breakdown of the electric current that has resulted in a breakdown of links in the Pacific region and has made it difficult for the authorities to perform rescue efforts.
The armies have begun to send buggies and assistance from Jakarta and other cities, the declared authorities, but those released have left their homes in dire need of food and other necessities.
The city airport is reopened for the purpose of helping together and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widi was scheduled for a visit to the missions to which people were abandoned in their homes in Palu.
The Toll Soars in Indonesia of Tsunami are more than 800.
Some are Old.

" told me to see many destroyed houses", said.
Too bad
And like relief teams who begin to express the overwhelming feelings of opening up the signals of relief from disasters, some complain that deeply professional foreign relief workers have been denied to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian principles, funding, support and employment for overseas workers can only begin to travel if the port is announced as a place of national disaster.
That's not possible right now.
"It is still a disaster in the province's class, said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"The Government once said, "FitLY., this is a national disaster," we can open up help to the United Nations but we still have no class at present."
As it was the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami, relatives and relatives of those who had not seen it still hoped that their friends and relatives would arise and that this miracle would leave a story that might be unheard of in natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of the garage.
The rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped in a cave for two days, and the mother’s body was found on her side.

The U.S. is a multiplication A.I.
China has become more active in non-junk, U.S., and has to double the time spent in the research section, says AI financial sponsor and AI projecter Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These compartments will come after different parts of the U.S. government have made AI proclamations, and like the U.S., fall short of all official AI methods.
Meanwhile, China announced its schedule this past year: it was intended to be No.1 in AI design in 2030.
"Repetition of AI research chart will be a good start, as all other countries after the U.S., and look at the next design of AI," says Lee.
The multiplication of funds can repeat the next great success of AI to be performed in the U.S., said Lee in an interview with the CNBCs this week.
Lee, author of the book "The Great Power of AI: China, Silin Valley and New World Order" published this month by Honorton Mifflin Harcourt, The EEO of the Sivation Ventures, supporting one of the largest AI firms in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, she worked on the AI programme that struck the highest holdman of the American Othello player, who was the head of the Microsoft Research later, who was president of Google at the China branch.
Lee has accepted the previous competition for U.S. government technology as a challenge to the Government's High-Programs of the High Security Research Institute and has asked when it will be held next, to select the following insights.
U.S. researchers must work hard to win government funding, says Lee.
"It's not Chinese to take the educational leaders; they are the collectives," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have employed professionals from universities to work in AI in recent years.
Lee said that the change of international travel police would help support its AI efforts
"I think the green card will be automatically given to those who make the PD's in AI," he said.
The National Council of China issued its Institute of Intelligent Intelligence in the Second Century in July 2017.
The Chinese National Institute of Natural Science provides education for students in the same schools as it does the National Institute of Natural Science and other government institutions that offer money to researchers in the U.S., but the level of education is lower than China, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year in the U.S., the Security Department established the Distinction Center, which was designed for the involvement of the working crew from production to education, and the White House announced the establishment of the Distinature Committee.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment as the beginning of a trial called AI next.
Since NSF, it now costs more than $100 million per year for research in AI.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislation aimed at creating the National Security Commission in the Non-Muidual Intelligence Commission has not yet been established in these months.
The Macedonians voted in the referendum to change their country’s name.
The Macedonians voted on the eferendum on Sunday to change the name of the country into the "Northern Republic of Macedonia," an action that would solve the age - ten- year- old controversy with its members to call for values in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, whose province is known as Macedonia, requires that it be in its vicinity in the North must represent its position and complete the entrance to the NAT and EU.
Two governments agreed in June on the request for a new name, but opposition to the Nationalists against a term that they claim to destroy the origin and culture of most of the Macedonians' Slav.
President Gjorge Ivanov says that he will not vote the eferendum and that he refused to cooperate is not sure that his voters can meet the requirements for 50 percent of the minimum required to carry out the normal referrundum election.
The question in the vote document of referendum reads: "May you be a member of the NATO and EU who accepted the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of exchange, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price paid is worth what is worth in order to be adopted from such tablets as the EU and the Macedonian NATO, one of the countries to meet in the Yugoslav campaign.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of this world, making for new people here in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, for that will mean a safe life for all of us," says Olivera Georgijska, 79, Skopje.
Although not legally binding, the members of the parliament have said that they will be bound with the outcome of the vote so as to make it fair.2]

"Here I will vote for my children, our place in Erpe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prince Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Macedonia for the transition of the name to the NATO and European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Before a parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, which consisted of 54, prepared a small platform and moved in front of the tent the seats placed by opposers of the referendum.
"We're not NANAT and EU, but we want to join actively, not in door service" said Kavadarkov.
"We’re a poor country, but we're good.
If they do not want to accept it as Macedonians, we can convert such countries as China and Russia into part of the euro-Asian partnership.
The Prime Minister Zaev says that the NATO's membership will bring the most needed investment in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that most people will be interested in it because more than 80 per cent of the population like Nato and EU," said Zave after vote in the charter.
Saying you're "yes" will be the result of "to make sure of our future."
The series of votes will be published by the final Day of the Macedonian Police Research Center between 30 per cent and 43 percent of the voters who will participate in the refenum-below the number required for the vote to be successful.
One team of voters, conducted by the Telma TV of Macedonia, found 57 percent of the people who planned to vote on Sunday.
In the year 70 percent of the votes are "yes" and theirs. percentage is the normal level of the time.
To be successful in vote on the fendoms, it must vote 50 percent and one person more.

Scherzer wants to play with Spoiler vs. Rockies
when listing the Nationals in a collision with the planoffs, there is no reason to force a re-starting.
But Sherzer, who remained in the race, hopes to find a higher place on Sunday when playing the Colorado Rockies, but only when the effects are reduced on the Rockies programs, and to manage the lead level of the Los Angeles Didgers in the Western NL.

Trump ladders in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding a person chosen in the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh when speaking about the importance of leaving the Republics to vote on a medieval option.
"All that we have done may be lost in November.
The five weeks remaining before the inauguration of history are now of great importance.
This choice is a great, big, and I'm not running for that whole place in my quest to find deserving ones," says.
Trump went on to say, "You see the evil elements, the evil things of the violent Democratic group, you see them happening right away.
And he is willing to absorb power from them by using any means he considers appropriate, cruel, merciless.
They don't care for anyone who has hurt them, who will go above him, to get power and control, and behold, only what they want to do in power, and we will not give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a number of machines on a mission to "duct and interfere."
"You have seen what happened four days ago," said, calling the Democrats "because they're angry about being cruel and unkind and not being fair."
He referred to the Senate Committee for Democratic Senate’s Senator Sanne Feinstein in his name, where he has received protests from onlookers.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you been a traitor?
Oh, Ah, what.
No, no, I wait for another – it has been so bad that I have never seen it.
Labour is no longer in church.
Do not put up with this debate
While the Momentum's acrbitists in my local team voted to disagree with me, it was a surprise.
After all of this, I am the foremost member of the Labour ms list to be told that she should not be informed of all who speak what they think.
A member of the parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment in my case and stood firm with confidence in his stand against the Jews.
In my case, my criticism and opposition were not compatible with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the important police of the working economic system, the security of this country, Europe, by placing similar matters where Jeremy disagrees with previous directors.
The meeting notice of Notingham East Labor wrote that "We want the meetings to be included and with good results."
Almost all these eight years I have been a member of the Labour in the community, the GC evening meetings during Fridays were always so exactly.
Where it occurs today, the modern meeting is a feature of which are generally ‘ humane and gentle, low political, or non-equity.
It seems to be a growing fact of different opinions that are not accepted in the Labour group and that the whole concept is examined before it is accepted by the liberation group.
This begins after Jeremy entered the administrative seat, as a fellow worker and I had previously thought of sharing with him in a similar political opinion and expected to change it immediately and take the places I did not agree with whether I would comply with the protection of the zone or the one of the EU.
Whenever I speak out, and what I don't care about is that the harassment on the chat pages should be reduced to the seat, not accepted local politics, I am told that I should not be in the Labour group.
And that is my experience.
However, I know that I am more fortunate than my fellow workers as concretes are brought to me directly are political.
I respect the skill and determination of my workmates who face sexual or ethnic harassment every day but cannot keep them away from me.
One of the most disturbing features of this political system is the degree of torture and the tendency to want to be common.
The last week, Jeremy Corbyn, explained that the Labour team had adopted the tradition of tolerance.
The fact is that this is no longer large and in an "inexperience" or a change of class principles.
I have so many advice over the past two years that I have asked me to stop, not to speak as I do and then, "All is well."
But this is no political option.
However, I joined LaBour in 32 years as a student, being persuaded by the Thallcher government not to neglect the room where I read it, since then I have vowed I would fight for the best public services and which they need, especially if I was a dresser or a government minister.
I did not hide my involvement in politics, including this previous election.
No one in the Notingham East would be confused in any way about where I stood in my police station, and in places where I do not agree with the present leaders.
In these raised cases now in English, I would say that when Brexit influences you to harm you in the homes, businesses, and our public services, I don't understand his desire to spend time and energy on my trust in the management of the Labour team.
Be sure that the one message I have will not go to Notingham Momentum, go to my people, whether they are members of the Labour or not: I am proud of working under you and I promise that there is no value to be left in fear or political help can prevent me from doing what I believe is your best interests above all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr goes ahead
The two latter tris have led to nearly the finish line to the results, but there is no doubt that Ayr is worth such a great victory for the celebration of the Tenent's Premiership game.
Now they raise the level, which is the main part of the division.
Finally, it was their high - quality protection, and their opportunity to take a better opportunity, resulting in a violation of the privacy of the home with the instructor Peter Murchihe.
"We have been tested in our games up to this day, and have not been beaten yet, so I should be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: "To praise Ayr, do better than we do."
Grant Anderson in his respirator for 14 minutes, changed by Frameiser Climo, and put Ayr before him, but, the Scottish rap card Roll Hughes, won the game by the Wars, let Melrose make his own batteries, and Jason Baggot tried to change them.
The Climo presented the Ayr's leadership with a pennalty, before, a time of half the game, and then changed the condom try to 17-5 in Ayr during rest.
But the Melrose has begun well in the second half and the Patrick Anderson's ear, which was converted by Baggot, has reduced the time of five points.
It has been said that the damage to Ruriidh Knott, who has been caused by a stout, and the return of Ayr has increased rapidly by Stafford McDowall, translated by Climo.
Ayr’s deputy captain Blair Macpherson has been given a yellow card, and again, Melrose has fined another man on Bruce Colvine’s unturned bicycle, under intense pressure.
However, it is returned home and when Struan Hutchinson was given a black card because of putting the Clam without a ball without the line of Penalti, MacPerson went back to sleep as the Ayr.
Climo has changed, as almost ever since it was started, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong’s balls in a box and sent the pink flag to Gregor Henry away with a fifth player.
The Still Games seems to be determined for a new task in the division of the horizon.
The Still Game Seed seems determined in the reception section after it has been discovered that he has been appointed the director of a licensed insurance company.
A 56 - year - old man plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show, which he writes and another expert on humoring Greg Hempill.
The two have already explained that the coming nine will be the last of the show and that Kiernan is evidently preparing to do something else after Craigang.
According to tradition records, he is the ruler of Adriftmorn Limed.
This player does not want to notice about this article, although the source of the Scotish Sun has said that Kiernan wants to enter a successful "stressing business" in Glasgow.
'We' Sea: Bolivia, trapped in the world, hopes that the road will open its way to the Pacific
The sailors lay in La Paz a masthead.
Public cups of blue flag.
The sea-fleets from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are signed with the words: "Our Sea is officially ours."
To get it again is our work.
Throughout Bolivia, the memories of the sea shore of Chile in the Great Depression of the 19th century are still alive in the mind - as is the desire to go again to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes have increased considerably over the centuries, as Bolivia awaits the court of the world’s law on October 1 after five years of discussion.
" Bolivia has the power, the spirit of unity and calm, and waiting with good cheers results," says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's representative.
Many Bolivia’s inhabitants will listen to the Supreme Court’s decision in the country’s highest courts, hoping that the Hague court will stand up on a Bolivian charge of four decades later in Chile is forced to think of giving Bolivia a place of luxury into the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivian president of a lifetime and a native nation facing a difficult war to be elected again in the coming year, also has much to do with the Judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," confirming this by the end of August.
But some jurys, if it is unlikely that a court would be able to render judgment on the Bolivian side, will make a big difference.
The United Nations Council established in the Netherlands has the power to expel Chileland, and it states that it does not know the effects of possible speech.
The fact that the Court’s decision went out just six months after the trial shows that this case was “confirmed, ” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean legal specialist.
And rather than cooperating with Bolivia’s desires, four years may bring it back to its normal routine.
"Striction issue has been confiscated by the present state of Bolivia," says Záratete.
Morales ’ declaration has concluded any kindness on their backs in Chile, said.
Bolivia and Chile will one day talk again, but it will be more difficult to hold a conversation after that.
The two countries have not sent in a delegation since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative at The Hague, has rejected the fact that the court has decided exceptionally fast.
Monday will give Bolivia "a special opportunity to open up on a new page of cooperation with Chile" and the opportunity to finish the 139 years of conflict, said.
Calzadilla also rejected the fact that Morales - owned one of the most popular presidents in Latin America is using the sea as a political base.
" Bolivia will never give up his right to reach the Pacific Ocean, and he will run away as it says.
"This judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome things that have happened in the past."
North Korea says that it will not abandon nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States
North Korea Minister R Yong Ho says that his country will not be rid of its nuclear weapons if it does not trust Washington.
RI was speaking of Saturdays at the United Nations Legislative House.
He asked the United States to follow through on promises made during a conference in Singapore.
This is the comment that the National Chairman Mike Pompoo appears to be about to resume a nuclear treaty that had been abandoned more than three months after those in Singapore and Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is "som day" that the continuing acceptance and acceptance of the United States is a proposal that will end the Korean War will cause the North to give up.
Washington is careful to sign this agreement before Pyongang took steps to break away from these weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are looking for a second conference.
But many doubt that Pyongangang is willing to give up the weapons that the country consider to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pomppeo plans to visit Pyonganger this coming month to arrange for the meeting of Kim and Trump.
The display of Paris’s fashion shows the different hats you will see on the streets of the nearby city
If you want to increase the hats you have or want to catch the sun, then don't go somewhere else.
The inventors Valentino and Thomas Browne have begun to form a large number of very unusual helmets for the SS and the S19 shows that have stepped alongside the deck set up on the Paris Fashion Plan.
These awesome hats have filled the Instagram, and the artists have sent their awesome hats to the view.
The solitary hat of Valentino's pennie has a broad range of feathers covered the head of the Officer of the Watch.
Some of the larger helmets included an earring mattress, a cap of a hat, and even a pin - not designed to warm your head.
Thomas Browne also brought with him a series of startling memorabilia during the period of the Northern Hemisphere.
Many of these colorful beaks have their lips borrowed and are much more similar to Hannibal Lecter than the fashion they wear.
One helmet would be like entering in a water with a respirator, while the other was similar to an ice cream.
And if you like fashion models, you are fortunate.
Cyberattacks say that these hats may also be coming to your area.
These impressive hats are on the steps of the LaBamba, a sunma with a pair of feet in the width of persons such as Rianna and Emily Ratajkowski.
A copy of the unique hat that filled the pages of communication has brought with it another large display that was displayed on the coast of grass that is almost as large as an insignia in the clothes you carry.
The orange bag, with the top edges of the flat-colored raffas, was foremost in the collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in the Paris Express.
The famous designer Lucke Artimage told you this about FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and sea bags reaching people the following summer - as the designer has become a little more difficult to take in the people who will be curious about these great things.'
John Edward: Anthropomorphisms for the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a reputation for academic progress, and this has continued in 2018 with other long- term tests, which are reinforced by individual and group success in sports, art, music and other public activities.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to contribute to a higher level of service to their students and parents.
Vocational schools try to prepare their students for higher education, as well as for their favorite subjects and places as people on earth.
As a class of education that can design and install a school textbook that fits circumstances, we see existing languages continue as a preferred and preferred education in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in the language he understands, he reaches his or her mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, he reaches his excuse."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English for association and mutual trust.
From the recent results of the observation, we can see that languages are higher in the library to a higher level of schooling.
An average of 68 percent of foreign students have received a series in Higher credit A.
The mustered data, in the 74 schools of SCIS, indicates that 72 percent of the students have received Higlergrade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent of Spanish students have obtained A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills for children and young people as they are in the future.
Now languages, such as choice education, are equally valued as studies of STEM (science, trueology, mineming and metamortics) in private schools and others.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Emploment and Skills in 2014 found that among the reasons employers were given for the lack of technical breakthroughs, 17 per cent are associated with the lack of linguistic skills.
As a result, more and more languages are being needed to prepare young people for future projects.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are vital in a cooperative world.
No matter what job you choose, if you learn another language, you will have an added opportunity to enjoy the future of endless talents such as this one.
The ability to communicate well in another culture has given a wide range of opportunities for people of many languages.
According to the You Gov survey of some 4,000 UK seniors in 2013, 75 percent could not speak another language enough to communicate, and only French is more than 15 per cent.
That is why spending money on increasing the language is now important to children.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those in the developing world, will equip children with fine opportunities to find a prestigious job.
In Scotland each of these schools will become quite varied in their own language.
Several schools will focus on the old languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be of great importance in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child likes, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in private schools, and there are excellent teachers in this section.
The independent schools in Scotland are eager to provide a educational environment that will equip children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter where they may go in the future.
It cannot be denied now, in the commercial climate of the world, that languages continue to play an important role in the world’s future, so this must be evident in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be viewed as “the ability to communicate with the world."
The independent schools will continue to offer this choice, separation and independence to young people in Scotland.
It's hard to talk about.
John Edward is the Head of the Scottish Association of Ecumenical Schools
LeBron will survive the Lakes record on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is about to end for the followers who want to see LeBron James beginning in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' teacher Luke Walton announced that James would play on the Church tragedy scenes against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it seems that he will be playing for a number of minutes.
"You will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton in the Lakers legal website.
The Lachishist Mike Trudell noted that James may have played only a few minutes.
After this week’s early exercise, James is asked for his own sheumulistic plans for the Lakers tribulation.
"I don't want any public sports in this level of my work to be good," says.
Trump's West Virginia Ranly Time, in Youtube Channel
President Donald Trump sets out his night - long conferences in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is its first of five scheduled Trump convention this coming week, including a visit to a pleasant neighborhood including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the certificate chart is set up until he chooses to be appointed in the Supreme Court, the Trump tries to reverse the second election, since the Republicans are in danger of losing the status of the Congress on the election in Nov.
When will the Trump convention in West Virginia be evening, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump conference of Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m.ET evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump convention of West Virginia on the Internet with the wry strit in You Tube.
Trump is expected to speak at the week’s meeting of the High Court’s election of Brett Kavanaugh, in an awkward position because of charges of mischievous behavior that are supposed to be set up to confirm for a week while the FBI does research.
But the main goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans to cope with the election of November.
As a result, the aim of President Trump said that these five meetings will be aimed at the next week as the Republicans try to protect and increase their numbers in the House of Parliament and the Bank," reports Reuters.
"Compress control is so important to him that the president will go to so many countries as we approach the busy brigadier city," the speaker of Tup who never wanted to know what to tell him Reuterss.
Numbered at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this modern night reality can deny support from "Ohio and the Minsylvania and is also known in Pittsburgh for its history," says West Virginia News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, which the government commission won 40 percent of its articles in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Federal Republic Society, Patrick Morrisey, who follows the election.
"It is not a good sign for Morsey that the president is obliged to provide support for him," says Simon Header, a Protestant scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The American team indicates that successful hunting will continue to fight like the plague of going into individual sports on Sunday.
After three games a person plays alone, playing as the start of a four - person team was the most important thing that the Ryder Cup needed.
The promotion of any team has made the idea of sports that the players really believe in, and it is a competition like this.
In this way, who is most prominent at this time?
"Bascurs them for six and are now four, so I think they are ahead," says Jordan Spieth while he is on his way that day.
Europe has taken this opportunity, in fact, with four articles above and another 12 yet still unprovable.
The Melikakas, as Spieth says, if you feel that it is going well and that there are many who would be interested in it, including the way Spieth and Justin played best throughout the day and the couple have three fourths.
Spieth has always played well since the beginning and paid by example.
When people shout in triumph for joy while he is playing, he puts the ball in the crucial moment after he and Thomas have been hit with two grades.
The playing of a ball in a hole that enabled them to win the game when they reached 15 makes people cry in the same way, in a way that tells them that the American team is losing.
"You must be very concerned about your sport," says Spieth.
So they left.
18 holes to mark them.
Players on top of Spieth and Thomas for the past two days by Francesco Molinary and Tomy Fleet, unconducted Ryder Cup
The paths of Europe offer unusual couples and cannot do anything wrong.
"A couple called "Moliwood" is the one who doesn't soggey on Saturday morning and Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and Back Nile on Friday morning.
That cooperation, along with their interest, looks attractive to the crowds as church-containers, and no other famous athlete can overcome Europe by sunset at the Gulf National rather than Fleetwood and Molinari.
It is best that they play together at the same time in different places.
Talk of European success has not yet been seen, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did the work of Sergio Garcia, a champion of four footballs in the morning, when he obtained cooperation with Alex Noren.
The Bogey and other two two two-pounders of the Fort 4 and the Spanish hole and the Swedes were unable to get out of it.
On Sunday, however, nobody can help you to get out of the pit.
Four footballs and four players are glad to watch them nearby because of the cooperation of the combined people, their advice, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how the program can change in a relatively short period of time.
Europe has been playing better as a group until now and is leading up to the last day, but four players have proved that this American team is hungry for an undesirable defeat if possible, particularly Statside.
Europe is leading 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup after four articles and games of four athletes have earned 10-6 Americans.
It is of interest to a couple, Tomy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary, have changed the game to overcome troubled Tiger Woods to make progress in the Le Golf National in four points.
The case of Thomas Bjorn of Europe, wanting to win the victory of Hazeltine in the last two years, won the America’s morning case by four points, winning a series of games in 31.
The Americans did not accept the games of four people, winning two games, although they did not want to end the debt.
Jim Furyk’s side requires eight articles on 12 games for the presentation
Fleetwood is the first European to overcome four points that were still new together with Molinari, called "Melliwood" after weekends of the first two-rates to win the four points when the Ryder Cup is opened.
When they struck Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they went on to win Woodsn and the neighboring Melins Dechambeau between 5 and 4 times.
Woods, who were attracted to the two Saturday games, showed interest there but divided 19 games from 29 games in four games and four players in a rocket
Justin Rose retired early in the morning and returned with his colleague Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes in 21 and with one who separated Dustin Johnson from Brooks Koepka - top worldwide
Europe was no match for France.
Three times their father's Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas did the best for the Melakanas receiving two articles on Saturdays.
They gained a victory by 2 to 1 while playing with the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of these foubals, and they also split the Paulter and Roy McIlroy in 4 and 3 of these keys separated by two opening doors.
Twice in the Ryder Cup, the crew goes from four points to individual games, although Furyk's side requires playing through each other to get a dot
After two days, Sunday’s attack serves to protect them.
The North Korea says that ‘ it will never complete its equipment before it gets secure.
The director of the North Korea external center told the United Nations on Saturdays that these judgments made it unlikely among America and that there was no way that America could complete its Nuclear armament when she could obtain protection certificates.
R R Yong Ho told the attendance to take positive steps last year, such as to stop the testing of weapons and to displace the Nuclear armaments, and to make a promise that we would never again make the Nuclear weapons.
"No matter, we see no parallel steps from America," said.
"If there is no promise from America, there will be no hope for the security of our country and in this case we will never destroy our equipment without speaking to America."
By the time Ri again reported what the North Korea had said about American resistance to finishing Nuclear armaments in stages less than what North Korea has received in terms of small measures, his report did not deny the fact that Pyongang was doing the wrong operation.
RI spoke of a joint report issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in the first conference between the president of America and the North Korean governor of Singapore on June 12, when Kim offered to work "to complete Nuclear weapons in Korea instead of Korea" while Trump promised the security of Korea.
North Korea wanted to bring an end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but America said Pyoning should first eliminate Nuclear weapons.
Wahington has declined requests to reduce the harsh international sentences facing North Korea.
" America forces the completion of Nuclear armaments first" and increases the degree of pressure with sentences to fulfill their purpose in a compelling way, highlighting the declarations of the end of the war," Ri says.
"The idea that judgments can frighten us is a false dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that these judgments increase mistrust.
RI did not speak about the plans of another Kim conference and Trump conference, which the American leader spoke before the United Nations this week.
Instead of speaking about three meetings between Kim and the Southern governor Maon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the group in this case of passing the Nuclear armament is South Korea, not America, would it be to complete the Nuclear weapons instead of Korea's."
However, Ri felt different than the previous year, when speaking to the U.N. international convention. The aim of the North Korean flying equipment in the American country was inevitable after the "Mn. Evil President" Trump called Kim "man's lifeman" who wants to commit suicide.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to ‘ destroy utterly, ’ North Korea, gave Kim a bold praise for taking steps to eliminate weapons, but this says a great deal of work and the sentences will remain far away from the Nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no set time, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months to pay attention."
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyonging on the steps he has taken.
Nevertheless, American secretary Mike Pompoo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "Containment of the Security Council must not continue in force until we can see the total destruction of Nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has reported cases in accordance with North Korea since 2006 with the purpose of reducing the Nuclear flying systems of Pyonang.
Pompeii met Ri beyond the U.N. General Assembly and said he was going to visit Pyonang again to prepare for the second conference.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not changed.
He left Pyonang in July, saying that there was a development done, but North Korea claimed that he did "need like those of the robbers."
The North Korea promised to meet Manon this month so that they could break up the space of the Nuclear flying instruments if America is "compatible steps."
Kim told him that the "coal steps" needed for the security certificate that Trump promised in Singapore and the progress in normal relations with Washington
Harvard students take a thorough rest course
A new study at the Harvard University this year makes all students who are not yet in high school fall asleep enough to combat the practice of reading all night with caffeine.'
One expert has found that students at the top of the university do not know anything about their basics.
Charles Czeisler, director of clinics at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, conducted this study, they believe that this type of type of medicine was first in America.
He was encouraged by his talk about the consequences of insufficient sleep during the courses.
'When one of her classes was finished, a girl came to me and said: ‘ Why am I told that now, I’m going to finish school?'
She told me that no one had told her the importance of sleep, and she told The Telegraph.
This study was started this year, explaining the benefits of sleeping in regard to educational and sports development, including improving their general health.
Paul Barreira, a clinical psychologist at the Harvard Medical School and a senior director of a university medical course, said that the university had decided to bring the subject to a study after obtaining students who did not really sleep.
This one - hour study consists of a series of exciting activities.
In one section there is a picture of a university bedroom, where students practice coffee cups, curtains, training clothes and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light and lack of sleep affect sports development.
In one section, participants are told how lack of sleep increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A school map, with fascinating characteristics, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
‘ We know that we will never change the behavior of the students immediately.
Even so, we believe that they have the right to know them — since you have the right to know the health effects of the use of the drums," says teacher Czeisler, adding.
The culture of sleeplessness still exists, which means that modern technology and pressures on students prevent them from falling asleep with a growing problem
To ensure a good night’s sleep should be an unidentified weapon against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, as well as to avoid weight, since insomnia is a mental disorder, causing them to suffer from starvation.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old student of chemistry and biology in California, helped Professor Czeisler to do his homework, after attending his first class in Harvard for the first year.
She says that the class had opened her eyes and that she was interested in making it available to the whole class.
You hope that the next step is to invite the students in their seats to do the same reading before entering the competition.
Dr. Czeisler advised students to think that they would make an alarm of sleep time, and wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of light in electrical appliances and LEDs, which could interfere with the daily sequence of activities, which can lead to sleep problems.
The Livingston 1-0 Ranges Ragers Menga with the father of the men of Gerard on one point
The Ragers also encountered trouble while playing while Dolly Menga was beating Steven Gerard on one point in the egg (1-0) at Livingston.
The Irox’s case was about to go on first trip after St Johnstone struck on 41 in February. But the Gary Holt's team struck Gerard a second time in 18 games, which began to be the manager with eight points except a leading group in the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Herts.
Menga received an article in several minutes before the halt-time and the Ringers were not interested.
By the time the Ragers went down to the sixth position, the Livingston rose up to the third after it by the Hibernian.
And there are problems that still come to the Ragers after thelineman is treated with headaches after he has been hit by a missing object from the side of the crew.
Gerard has changed players of the time to accompany Ayr in a game before the final Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt continues with 11 Livingstone players who took the same point to the Hearts a week ago and is excited in the way his team hit its opponents in every way.
The Ragers controlled the game, but Livingstone did more when he received the ball.
It should have happened in the second minutes when the Menga player let Scott Pittman pass to the Allan McGregor's but this middle player did not find it.
Kesibin Jacobs turned down the ball received by Craig Halket, but his partner, Alan Lithglew, was able to open a huge opening in the rear pans.
The Ragers did not get control but seemed more optimistic than belief about the third game before the last one.
Alredo Morelos feels that he should have received a pencil in the half - hour mark as he and Steve Lawles did, but the poet Steve Thomson paid no heed to the call of the Colombian performer.
The Ragers had the chance to reject the ball near the pancratium before the finishing of the first stage of the game, but the winner of the Ibrox Liam Kelly has not had a problem with the Lasana Coulibaly ball and Ovie Ejaria.
By the time Livingstone received the first article in 34 minutes that he had been difficult to find, no one can deny that it really deserved them without doing much hard work.
Ragers also failed to prevent the ball pulled by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield has not done as did Declan Gallagher, who sent a football to Scott Robinson, who has no concern for achieving Menga.
Gerard made changes early as Colulibaly applied Ryan Kent for this unexpected turn of events as the athlete opened the door to Moreorlos but the famous player ran away to cover him.
But the Livingston has continued to make this moving team to play the same thing he wants, and Lithgow and Halket were throwing the ball away again.
The Holt's crew would find an article at the beginning of the game, but the McGregor stood firm until he denied Jacobs before the presence of the Lithgow on board.
One Ragersman named Glenn Middleton had another case of punishment as he met with Jacobs but also did not pay attention to Thomson.
Almanac: Geiger Menu Editor
And now a paper from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and SASARA ... date Johannes Wilhelm "Sans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radiation, which was developed by the development of this equipment known as the Geiger Counter.
It has been used since then, the Geiger Centre has also been used in pop culture as well, as shown in the 1950 movie "Balls of Condawayo," which has the most likely players are scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘ What would that be? ’
Rogels: "IGeiger Counter, used to search for precious stones.
When you put these things into your ears, you will hear the effects of the Atoms which are produced by radiation.
Evans: "Speak, it’s coming right now."
"U Hans" Geiger died in 1945, after a few days of his 63 birthday.
But the eye that bears his name will live on.
A new cancer vaccine teaches the muscles to ‘ see ’ tough cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the muscles to ‘ see ’ tough cells and kill themselves
The vaccine teaches the muscles to see tough cells as part of the treatment
This process involves removing the cells of the body from the patient, changing them from the library
However, it may ‘ see the normal protein in cancer and be returned to the body again.
An experiment produces promising results for patients of various types of cancer.
One female patient who received treatment of the thyroid, which teaches the muscles to see unusual cells of the body, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in less than 18 months.
This process involves removing the body cells from the patient, changing them from the laboratory until "see" normal cancer proteins called HER2, and restore them to the body again.
University teacher Jay Berezofsky, of the American National Cancer Center in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results recommend that we have a real operation."
HER2 "gives the growth of different cancers." including breast cancer, ovarian, lung and stomach cancer, explains university teacher Berzofsky.
The same method of utilization for patients and for "detecting" cancer cells has been effective in the treatment of leximia.
The West closes the Trump Support on the Talks, carrying the MaGA, after appearing on the SNL.
Not a Better Way
Kane West did not get any extra support during the Saturday Night Live after a sudden break that brought praise to the American President Donald Trump and said you would enter the election in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, the Ghost Town song he composed bearing the spelling of the May America Great, he uttered a speech contrary to the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"Many times when I’m talking to a white person when they say: "How can you love Trump? You’re a racial person."
And I say, If I have been anxious about race, I would have gone a long time," he says.
The SNL begins its program with a video showing Matt Damon who laughs with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Committee of the Administration for Sexual Abuse on cases of sexual harassment from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not distributed, West video was installed in chat rooms by fortune - teller Chris Rock.
Understandably, Rock was trying to laugh at West.
Also, West is quite angry with observers by having to face the difficulty before entering the upper part of his leg.
"They have abused me back.
They said to me, 'Don't enter into the place that you are carrying.'
They abused me!
And they said I was in the wet area, which says, according to the Washington Examiner.

"But I have made a decision not to repay a person (by buying his music or giving him his support for his "power") which I believe he has accepted and cast dangerous ideas on my society.
You are free.
We, too," says you.
Prior to the program, this rap singer told his followers to Twitter that he had changed his name to justice, which he is known as "Kanye West right now."

The popular Time of Thornes, Kit Harington, speaks of trying to make a man in a dangerous way

‘ I feel hard, on my own side, at this point where we don't go well for the man?'
‘ What have we taught men as they grow older, about the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that the telescope is responsible for the problem of trying to make a man dangerous because of his male models.
He added: ‘ What is being taught?
What are the teachings of televisions and streets that make boys think that it is just a matter of being man - made?
How do I feel that this is the most important question at this time?
Because there is clearly something wrong with our boys.'
In this conflict she even agreed that she would never play the movie again after this coming version, which says ‘ she is finished with the wars and horses.
Since November Kit has been prominent in the renewed movie movie called Sam Sherpard's True West story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.

The couple were married in June 2018 in the home of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/ Aids: China reports an increase in 14% of new cases.
China reported an increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in 14%.
There are more than 820,000 victims in the country, says medical authorities.
An estimated 40,000 people were infected in the first quarter of 2018 alone.
In many cases people are affected sexually, not as normal as before.
Naturally, most people in China are affected by blood transfusions.
But the number of people affected in this way was reduced to total loss, so did the medical authorities in China at a council in Yunnan.
Every year, the number of HIV and AIDS infected in China has increased to 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a real problem for the LBT population in China.
Homosexuality has not been a thing of the past in China since 1997, but discrimination against the LBT people is said to be difficult.
Since this country has such a crisis of opinion, research explains that men who have sex with men of 70-90% will marry people around.
The effects often are created to be insufficiently protected from sexual intercourse in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has offered HIV access to drugs as part of the problem.
Maxxine Waters detailed details about the GOP network released by an employee on the basis of custom, developed a ‘ serious lie that can tell the facts.'
America’s representative Maxine Waters filed charges on Saturday that one of his employees put personal details of the Republican network to Wikipedia.
The Democrat of Los Angeles has been saying that these charges are advertised by experts and Web sites on their side.
"A lie, a lie, and a lot of lies," says Waters in a report in Twitter.
According to reports released by home addresses and telephone numbers of these Americans. Lindsey Graham of the Southern and Carolina, and Mike Lee include Orrin Hasch, Utah.
These findings appeared on the Internet on Thursday, introduced by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a conference on the impropriety of the justice and innocence of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
These findings were later published by the friends who asked Kavanaugh for questions.
Smart Web sites such as the Gateway Pundit and RedSata have reported that the IPs indicate that the source of waste installations is from the Waters office, and they even released the resources of Waters worker, says The Hill.
"These unprovable charges are absolutely false," adds Waters.
"A member of the staff is risked because his personal details are removed because of these false charges that are not available should not be responsible for the removal of these wastes.
This groundless accusation is absolutely false.
Waters report received quick criticism on the Internet, including the former secretary of the office of the American President Ari Fleischer.
"This doesn't sound," writes Fleischer
"That indicates that he doesn't have the degree of being a member of the Congress.
When someone is falsely accused of a wrong act, there is no need to feel angry.
He does not have to fight.
He does not have to ask the accuser’s motives.
You have to keep quiet and cool."
Fleischer might have compared Waters ’ response to the criticism by Democrats of Judge Kavanough, accused by critics of being very angry with the Thursday dawn.
Omar Navarro, the Republican beckons not enough to remove Waters during the year, also expressed his opinion on the Twiter.
"Great news if this is true," writes to Twitter.
In his cry, Waters said that his office had informed him "normal authorities and the law authorities on false charges.
We will make sure that the suspects are revealed," she adds, "and they will pay legally for their risky actions to my employees."
An analysis of Johnny English Strikes Again - a division of Rowan Atkinsos
It is not uncommon for days to look at things about Brexit when watching an English movie show the same way to the scene of an old glazed movie and the gang - started Johnny English - from 2003 and returned in 2012 as Johnny English Reborn.
Will this fascinating movie movie deal with the fact that we can no longer sell abroad?
The papal face - to - face named Johnny English has obtained his license to revive his name that indicates that he is a dishonorable figure made by non - English observers in other countries.
It is truly the work of the Royal Government which is quite different from that of the lesser Clousau, Mr. Bean and at least one of the little boys who sing at least one note in the Service of Fire in the event of opening London’s Olympics in 2012.
He is even a traveler with the international secret man Atkinson who has ever imitated the Scraycards of the televisions, leaving the conflicts where he goes.
There is one or two rings on the JE film.
I liked this time when Johnny English came to the helicopter wearing the former safety outfits while he was at the time hitting his seat.
Atkinson's gift of silent humor is of interest, but it is not strong in comparison with such hard products as at least 007 with the Mission Inspiration that now includes humor.
This joke is as if children were looked at and not by adults, when I spoke on the side of Johnny English's laughter does not show a great deal in comparison with Atkinson’s non-substantial movies.
News in this movie indicates that English is in serious trouble
An Internet producer entered the network on the Internet, saw the details of all the working English crown, until the interviewer was surprised at the work - the smallest role of Kevin Eldon.
These stories are often passed by a proud high official, who faces the problem of being unpopular: Emma Thompson tries to do what is right as he plays Teresa May, but the author of the film doesn’t do well when he writes it.
The wise counselors told him that like all the customers at risk, he had to return the retired man.
And that is what the philosopher Johnny English himself, who has obtained the position of a good teacher at school, but who teaches unannounced lessons to be anonymous characters, while England teaches in a way that is more unusual than the times.
Ensh is sent back to Whitehall and told of this emergency to meet her best friend, Bough, who was once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is a married man, married to an underwater captain.
The couple who are able to do wrong in the civilian service are back to work, and they meet with Ophelia Bulletin, whom Olga Kurylenko served.
At the time, the prime minister believes that the rich rich billions of technology can solve the problems of English computers: the wicked man Jason Volts, played by Jake Lyy
English and Bough began such projects: making themselves food suppliers, burning French food fuel; they started problems when they boarded the famous Volta boat; and English brings an attack while trying to use the wear on the head of the Vortual Reality to read the inside of the Volta house.
Everything is done in the final section, though interesting and exciting, rather than child television programs about all of this.
Common things.
Like all other film shows of Johnny English: Do I wonder if the English movie industry could not give Robin Atkinson a proper role in his ability?
A group of workers refuse to make a schedule for the citizens of Britain to work for four days but to be paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s team made a schedule for workers to work four days a week, but they were paid five days ’ wages.
Reports say that this group requires companies to require employees to be paid for their company's wages when companies are working with Articidal Intelligence (AI) by giving them a day.
This change will result in a three - day weekend but of a similar reward.
The sources say that this program will be “well suited to the economic ideas of this group and the national reform plan to take part in the staff.
A four - day shift to a four - day week project in support of the Trades Union Congress as a way for employees to take part in economic change.
A top source of Labour Party told the Sunday Times: ‘ System tests are expected to be announced before the year passes.
‘ It will not happen immediately, but a four - day working week is a fitting idea of this new economic agency to be on the side of the employees and the company's business schedule.'
The crew is not the first to give support to such an idea, and the Green Party made a four - day schedule during the election in 2017.
The program is currently not fully supported by the Labour Party, however.
A spokesman for the Labor Department said: ‘ The four - day week work is not a team policy and it is not something to watch. '
The assistant official John McDonnell has used a previous week’s conference to explain his view on a financial translation that helps people.
Mr. McDonnell says that he is determined to take power from ‘ private administrators ’ and ‘ profit from big business.
The service director’s schedule says that the participants on the water-handling machine cannot find their share as much as the service government can pay ‘ taxes ’ that they do not do well.
He also confirmed his plan to put employees in managerial positions and to make a certificate of worth that involves everyone in order to provide a 10 percent share of the non-governmental businesses that can provide £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" that the FBI may change their understanding
The FBI’s investigation of charges laid down by Judge Brett Kavanough has forgotten the final chart on his arrests to the High Court each week, and it raises the question whether the results of the research done by the institute can change the majority of the Republican population to change their minds with the support they offer.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, the journalist "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asks the Republican network John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI will find something that could make them think.
Kennedy felt free to speak to his friend from South Carolina.
"Yes" says Kennedy.
"I'm going to get into the garbage, and I'll speak to the judge Kavanaugh."
I called on him after this had happened, and after the charges had been brought out, I said, ‘ Did you do it?'
She was calm, confident, fearless.
It seems, however, that Graham’s shirt did not change.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavanough and will have to be a heavy spell," he said.
Gqerh. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this is what I know: Brett has strongly denied these keys," adds Graham, speaking with Chrstine Blasey Ford.
"Everyone who speaks of him can confirm these charges.
36 years
I can't see changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce stress?
This Saturday, the New York City will welcome the Global Citizen Festival, a annual musical feast with the remaining singing and a fine purpose; to finish the procession.
The event is now quite late, and it welcomes tens of thousands of people in Centra; Park not only to enjoy such features as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to bring them to the purpose of the most difficult event in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a section in addition to the Global Poverty Project, an international center that hopes to eradicate racism by adding responsible people to the fight against it.
To get a free ticket to the party (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you must do a volunteer work like writing an e-mail, phone call, or whatever practical means are needed to inform other people of their cause to end poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been when he is 12 years old fulfilled its purpose?
Is it good to give people a good deal of attention to the way of breaking support - people feel that they make a difference by signing a webcast or posting a message to Twiter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen reported that he has counted 19 million actions on its supporters, dealing with a variety of purposes.
These actions have helped by encouraging global taxpayers to record record the obligations and financial policies of more than $37 degrees that will be responsible for the lives of 2.25 billion people in 2030.
Early in 2018, the team explained the commitments and reports for their actions, which amounted to $10 billion.
This group claims that its income has helped nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of these obligations include The Power of Nutrition, which is a financial center for the U.S. financial institutions and the people who do it, whose purpose is "to help the children to reach the level of maturity," which promises to provide the Rwanda’s $35 million to help overcome malnutrition in that country after receiving 4,700 messages from the Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments of different states and the Global Citizens like you, we may be able to overcome the injustice of malnutrition," says The Power of Nutrition by Tracey Ullman telling the public during the event in London in April 2018
The team said that after the 5,000 actions requested by the U.K to improve the proper nutrition of mothers and children, the government informed them of the money to be paid to deal with the problem, in The Power of Nutrition, that would help mothers and children to provide food.
When they answer one of the most common questions asked on the Internet, "What makes you think we can resolve a difficult problem?"
The Global Citizen says: "It will create a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as with the rendering of human rights and the movement of confrontation before us, we will succeed, for we have power over others.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monnie, and others who will share in New York's annual celebration, will be welcomed by Deborra-Le Furnesses and Hugh Jackman.
America can use a water net to prevent Russia from pumping electric generators into the mainland
America can find safety under the naval force to prevent Russia from selling electrical appliances, including the Middle East, explains the Native American Secretary, Ryan Zin Alle as the Washington Examiner.
Together they have made accusations that Russia is responsible for becoming part of Syria - where legitimate government officials are making a program to investigate new technologies.
"I believe their purpose to be in the Middle East is to sell to other countries as Europe has done to eastern Europe, in the interior of South Europe," says it.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means of dealing with them.
"The America has the power, with the navy, to make sure that the seaways are opened, and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure that their power is not going to the market, say.
Skeke spoke to those present at a event adopted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a group that does not make a profit which calls itself "in the voice of an American electric power.
He then compared the ways the Americans dealt with Russia and Iran, which say they have not changed.
"The economic choices in Iran and Russia, nearly always, to increase prices and to obtain other alternatives to oil," says, while calling Russia with a single fuel-based fuel-based fuel-based capacity is made by natural materials.
This report appears after Trump’s government attempted to promote the sale of water - producing foreign countries into the Russian sector, with no higher prices for European society.
As a result, Trump’s government officials, including American President Donald Trump, tried to stop Germany from supporting the "unjust" work of the Nord Stream 2, according to Trump's work he had made Germany a ‘ prisoner' of Russia.
The Russian would also say that the Nord Stream 2 unit, which costs billions of dollars, will double the present to 110 billion cubic metres, is a better job than the economy.
The Russian says that America’s opposition to the work has economic reasons and is an example of poor competition.
"I believe that these powers should not be the power of oppression, and consumers are obliged to select the merchants," says Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak after the conference by the American Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in Seppsula.
America’s position in this situation has not been well received in Germany, which has confirmed the determination of the work.
A major center of this trade, the Federal Government Office (BDI), has requested that America be away from the powerful EU policies and agreements related to Germany and Russia.
"I have a big problem when the third country interferes with our strength." So says Dieter Kempf, head of the German Business Center (BDI) after a meeting with the German general Angela Merket and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Eighteen government sectors and the Columbia region give support to the new legislation that condemns victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 sectors of government and area have signed a pledge to give support to one of the victims seeking the security of the law, says NBC.
The full name of the defendant in the case between Grace and Missions of the American Civil Liberties Union made in August about the unstated national law.

The agents of the government gave Grace the support that El Savador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which are the main places that bring more people to America for safety, as places that face serious problems regarding gang movements and domestic violence.
This new policy concerning safety in the United States presented a decision of 2014 by a refugee board that allowed refugees to escape domestic violence to gain protection.
President Karl Racine of Colombia reports on Friday that the new legislation is "rejecting old, governmental, national, and international laws."
"A national legislation requires all appeals to be considered by the facts and conditions of that request, and this law ends," says the court-based petition.
The agents also said that this law prohibiting refugees from entering America is damaging the American economy, claiming that they could be businessiers and perform necessary services.
General Jaff Sesions issued a ruling for judges that refugees can be given protection if they escape domestic violence or gang violence from June.
"Sections will be available for anyone who has left home because of persecution or because he is concerned about race, religion, or political opinion," says Sesions on June 11 when he reported on this law.
Safety was not designed to deal with all the problems -- and it is also difficult to deal with daily people all over the world.

A representative of an American country accuses China of ‘ exploiting ’ using ‘ false advertisements'
A week later a Chinese legal newspaper made a four - page sale every day in an American newspaper about the benefits of American trade and China, and an American representative in China accused the country of using American journalists to spread lies.
American President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about the China Daily ads in the Des Moines Register - Iowa - me newspaper to accuse China of its attempts to interfere with November 6, which accuses us of opposing China.
The Trump charge that China is trying to interfere with elections is what the American officers tell Reuters that a new sector of the development of America is to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for governments in different countries to put on advertising to promote trade, China and America are working against one another in the present market and are increasing prices.
China adds prices to the economic crisis and is designed to affect foreign exporters such as Iowa who support the Trumps of the Republic, says Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American representative in China and the old governor of Iowa, selling much of the food produced in China, said that China had destroyed American employees, farmers and businesses.
In China, Branstad writes expressing his opinion on the Des Moines Register, "It is determined to exploit it by putting false advertisements in our newspapers."
"In spreading false news, the Chinese government is putting himself at risk of hearing America using its usual free speech tradition and having free news and advertising center on the Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"Unlikely, instead of the news service here in Beijing when you come down from the platform, you will find a small contrast of ideas and not see how the Chinese really think about the economic development of China, we think they are the subject of the Chinese Communist group," he wrote.
He added that "one of the popular newspapers has denied his request to publish the matter" may not say what a newspaper was.
The Republiccans chased rounds prior to the election of the continent with the Kavanaugh problem, warning critics
As the Republiccans in high positions stand alongside the prisoner of the High Court Brett Kavanau and protect him from his charges, sexual abuse, the prosecutors say that they will see bad shots, especially among the people, in this coming quartery election of the first half.
The feelings about this situation are many, and the Republicans are still saying that they want to continue the election.
You can’t put those things behind you," says Grant Reher, a university instructor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School who tells The Hill when an article was published on Saturday.
Reher says he is skeptical that the last attempts of the sticker, Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to start the FBI research to change the mind of angry voters.
"People around will not quickly forget what happened yesterday - not to forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean- Pierre, senior counselor and public speaker of the group that continued Moveon on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the critics would say again, "November!" walking through the hallway as the Republicans controlled the Justice Committee and decided to continue the arrest of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of the doctor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"You are interested in freedom and encouragement," says Stu Rothenberg, a neutral spokesman, telling the news center.
"People have begun to tell you that you're up right now, this is true.
But it may be more than this, especially for people who have not yet decided who will vote with new voters, aged 18-2, who, although not interested in the president but who are not familiar with the vote."
Even before the evidence of Ford was publicly clear of his charges about the arrest of the High Court of Sexual Abuse, critics said that it would have serious consequences if the republics needed proof.
"This has turned out to be a problem about GOP," says Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republic National Committee last week when it started, according to NBC News.
"It's not important to the committee's last vote or if Kavangh is in the company, about how the Republicans dealt with this situation and how they dealt with him," indicates Guy Macel in this press station, the director of the Princes USA, the Democratic panel.
Nevertheless, the constituents seem to have no idea who they believe between the evidence of Ford and that of Kavanaugh, although there are a few who take part behind him.
The 41 percent who participated in one survey showed that they likely believe in or fully believe in the evidence of Ford, while 35 percent showed that it is possible to believe fully or fully believe as to Kanaugh’s.
In addition, 38 percent thought that Kavanough could be convinced that she was lying when she gave a witness, at the same time only 30 percent said of Ford.
After Flake’s interest, the FBI examines the charges brought by Ford and another spy, Deborah Ramires, says The Guardian.
Ford has signed evidence before the committee of justice and the previous week that Kavanaugh has abused her with 18 sex abuse when she is drunk of Kavanuagh
Ramirez claims that the hostage of the Supreme Court presented her private parts to her during the ceremony while they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
An Internet producer makes plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Le, the Internet producer, begins a new business with the purpose of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This technology agent has a new system in Inrupt, a system that produces Solid, a system available to everyone.
The Solid allows its users to choose where their details are stored and to whom they have the right to see those details.
In an interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee spoke on the Inrupt purpose of "Watching the World."
"We must do it now," which is about this business.
"Unrecognized minute"
This technology entry will allow people to make their own 's storage area' or POD.
It can include a list of phone numbers, a list of things to do, a calendar, your music, and other personal and professional activities.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify are in the same place at the same time.
Different from this storage area is whether the user chooses what he or she sees.
The company calls you "one person's personal equipment for information."
Inrupt’s plan, according to business executive John Bruce, to bring in tools, systems and related skills to make the Solid available to everyone.
The company currently has Berners-Le, Bruce, a program purchased by IBM, the developmental workers and the public of volunteer designers.
From this week on, technology producers around the world can produce a system they have made individually using the Internet.
Berners-Le said that he and his group don't speak "no Facebook and Goodle's about whether he made the major changes that could make their business disappear immediately.
"We won't ask their permission."
"UBerners-Le said when he wrote to the Media on Saturday that the Inrupt purpose was "to provide interest in businesses and places that would help protect integrity and the new Solid Internet level."
In 1994, Berners-Le changed the Nethinim when he formed the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Le has become an influential voice in this internal chat.
When properly opened Inrupt, Berners-Le will still be the producer and administrator of the World Wide Web Consortium, Internet Center and Open Data Center.
"I am happy over this new Internet section," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Teacher of Victoria cros in WW1
The first and last week of obtaining Victoria Cross during the World War.
Br. Col. clergyman Bernard Vann won this prize in 29 Sepje in 1918 during the attack on the Ballengise and Lehaukort.
Even so, he was killed by a catfighter who was shot so far that he died in four days without knowing that he would win the highest prize in Britain.
The monument was opened by her two grandchildren at Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his descendants, Michael Vann, felt that the discovery of the stone was not an easy one, since it was 100 years after his grandfather received a prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Vann paid for men under him to pass the Canal de Saint-Quentin "there is a heavy fog and being shot with heavy guns and machine guns."
Later he fled to those who were shooting, and he courageously took up those big guns and the only machine guns.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German suicide bomber on October 4, 1918 - more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says that his grandfather's actions "are what he knows he will never be able to do, but he said it is humble."
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, set up a history made up of a circle after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Land.
Michael Vann says that he feels "bubstantial as he is struggling to make a search" and adds that "the courage of the warrior of the truth will be shown by many people who provide support."

Think now, do not sleep because you want to watch Bellatro 206 just to meet you and not to play.
The San Jose system has 13 wars, including six broadcast by night on Cennel 5 UK.
At six in the morning, during the battle between Gegard Musasi and Roy MacDonald, the UK observers were surprised to see a change in the performance of Peppa Pig.
Some have been disappointed as they stayed all night to see the war.
One observer described this change in play as a bad joke
"The government policy that from six o'clock the program was no longer necessary because they had to change and install what was not seen by children, "This means the president of the advertising and communications of Bellator, when asked about what happened.
"Papp the pig," yes."
The Bellactor President Scott Coker said that they would change their times next to the UK observers.
When I think about playing again, I think it might be possible," says Coker,
"The problem is that time is six in the morning for them on Sunday will not be able to do this until Sunday on our own Mondays.
But come with a plan
I believe, when it turns into a lot of play and all was not happy.
We tried to fix it, thinking first that we had a mechanical problem.
But otherwise, it had been a State problem.
I promise him that he will never do that again.
We will reduce to five wars rather than x - as a paragraph - and try to bring too much of what they had hoped for but that we would do more.

Desert Island Disc: Tom Darley feels ‘ young ’ because of her sex
The Olympic marionette Tom Darley says that she grew up to be young because of her sexual appearance but that gave her an interest in winning.
This 24 - year - old tells me where I went to second school, "I’m not like everyone."
Speaking of the first policy of the Desert Island Disscs under Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she says that she spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give them "hope."
He has said that being a parent has led him into losing his desire to win the Olympics.
The familiar director of the program, Kirsten Young, suffers from illness for months.
appearance as one abandoned in Laverne’s first class, Daley says that he felt the smallest of his childhood because "it was not allowed to love boys and girls."
She said: "Until this day, the feelings of low and unique, are the things that have impressed me and the strength to succeed."
She wanted to prove herself "something," she said, so that she would not be embarrassed if she found out about her sexual appearance.
This winner of twice the Olympic copper contraband is a public campaign with LGT and has used his fame this year to the Commonwealth Games in Australia to request more countries to make the authenticity fair.
She spoke because she feels fortunate to be able to live without having to face problems and to give hope to others.
The winner of the world three times said that he had met another man - American movie producer in 2013 - "I didn’t expect it".
Dale is married to this winner of Oscar, aged 20 years older than he was last year, but he says that the distance between them was no problem.
"When you are confronted with such things as youth" - go to her early Olympics at age 14 and her father died of cancer three years later — it has been difficult to find someone of the same age who is facing similar problems of life.
The couple became parents in June, had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "All her thoughts have changed."
"If you asked me last year I would tell you that I needed to ‘ find a gold earring,' he said.
"You know, there are great things to finish the Olympic Olympics.
My mind is Robbie.
Her son bears the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dary says that her father did not accept her prospect of death and that he asked if they had a ticket to London in 2012 — since he wanted to continue.
"I couldn't say, ‘ You won't be in the front seat,' says.
"I was holding my hand when he finished breathing, and I saw after he was no longer breathing that he too could live forever," he says.
The following year Daley competed in the oil industry in 2012 and won a copper medal.
"I immediately realized that this is what I had always dreamed of — to swim in front of the crowd in the Olympic games, there was no better way for me to feel," she says.
It also impressed her to say that her first Proud, by Heather Small -, had always been interested in herself before the artists, and it frightened her.

Mickelson is not in play state in the Ryder Cup game on that Saturday
Dr. Phil Mickelson will make a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he is forced to change his performance so as not to make this sad record.
Mickelson, who plays the scene twice a year for the 12th, is crowned by Captain Jim Faryk in a 4 - football game with 4 persons.
Instead of being seen by crowds, as is the custom in the American games, the winner won five times a day without playing it and retraining himself with the aim of correcting the problem.
Although he is at the top of the game, the 48 - year - old player is not well suited for the sporting event in Le Golf National, where grass is available and makes it difficult for ballfighters.
If the playing field is frightening in itself, Mickelson, in the ninth session on Sunday, faces Francesco Molinori, who has successfully played the colorful British football team of Open, who has cooperated with Tony Fleetwood who is still studying to win all their games in this week.
If the Melikanas, which are less than 4 points. they start out well for 12 alone, the Mickelson’s game will be more important than it is.
Furryk has expressed confidence in my husband as expected.
"He has fully understood his role this day, and he has struck me a little behind and has laid his arm to be ready for the next day."
"You have real confidence.
You find the place of the famous hall and add much more to the group last time, and this week.
I didn’t think he could play two games.
I thought he was going to play more games than I had expected, but that didn’t work out the way we were supposed to.
He wants people to know him, like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass the record of Nick Faldo’s playing many games in the Ryder Cup at a church game.
It can make the decision of his playing in the Ryder Cup who is not like his personal record.
Mickelson won 18 times, was broken by 20 times, since Furk said that his presence brought some invisible features to the group.
"You're laughing, you have a good sense of humor, you're quick to respond, you're usually rude to people, and you’re a good person to be with him in group rooms.
"It was wonderful to see young players laughing about him in this week."
She gives only half of all happiness."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that it can be lost ahead of speed.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain of state, knows that we can lose a position of progress quickly as the group goes ahead in the Ryder Cup but that can change at any time.
The agent began playing in the Valderrama in 1997, where the case paid by the Seven Ballestros was five points ahead of America but was buried in the back, winning at 141 que1.131 ll2.
"You will tell you that you have many articles in Valderrama; you have many articles in Brookline, where they are planted and Valderrama, where we won, very hard," Bjorn, on the picture, after seeing the 2011 class won 5-3 on Friday and 6 of Le Golf National
History will therefore teach me and everyone else if this is not yet completed.
We will release all that we have tomorrow
We will do whatever we need to do.
This is not yet complete until there are points on board.
We have a goal in mind, and it is an effort to overcome it in the first place.
Once again, I aim for the 12 players beside me, but we know what we are dealing with in this one part of the rest of the world."
Excited by the way his players played in this difficult theater, Bjor added: "I didn’t really think about this.
By tomorrow we can express a different view.
The next day personal playing skills are checked, and that is a different thing.
It’s good to have a partner here when things are going well, but when you are alone, your strength is first tested as a golf player.
That is the message that all the players are forced to make, and they must present themselves tomorrow.
Now, you don't come with your mate, he or she must manifest himself again."
Unlike Bjorn, on the other hand, Jim Furyk has been looking for his players, not for a team, but for Jordan Apeith and Justin Thomas, who received three fourths.
Furyk, who has been both on the side of the changes of the last day, was on the side of Brookline when winning and losing as Europe performed "a miracle in Medidah."
"I remember everything he said," he replied that Ben Crenshaw was the Captain of 1999, how he became interested as they came to the last day.
"We have 12 games the next day, but you should not put them in mind as you saw them in Brookline and Medah.
When you start winning regularly, it exerts pressure on the ball.
We organize our players in order and put them in a way that will have good results, you know, we want to practice magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to pay for the war and face with Roy McIlroy in a high game, facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poloter Yurpohu on the upper edge.
"I'm going with this group of men on this schedule because I think they are going through all things," however, Mrs.
A German battleship was re-cuted.
A new German ship should be released in 2014 to enter the warship known as the Cold War, but the following year it will not be released because of the problems of the ship and the cost, says the newsman.
The release of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," a ship paying for the rest of the rest of the ship set up by Baden-Wuterberg-clas-figates, has been reduced to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, says a military speaker.
The ship should not have joined the Navy in 104, but the arrival of goods has made it possible.
These four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will be replaced by Bremen's Bremen.
It has been known that there will be a large superpower, along with other aircraft and aircraft and other technologies that make it invisible to Radar, infrared, and acetics.
Another important factor is that it takes a long time before it has to be corrected and may last two years away from home.
However, the ongoing interruptions enable these new ships, which are said to give power to Germany on the other side, and are out of the way when they are being driven.
This sailing vessel was released in news news last year, when the German Navy declared the voyage to Blom & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned the ship to the pilot after being launched.
Little is known about the reasons for the return of the ship but the German news reports that there are problems with “the machines and goods ” that make the ship function well, which would make the ship useless during the war.
The machines are more elaborate as the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships are used by 120 persons and half of the people who are forced to use the old Bremen.
For one thing, the ship is simply having a very heavy weight to limit her capabilities and that the navy will not be able to improve it in the future.
This 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship is believed to have survived twice as much as ships such were used by the Muslims during the second world war.
Despite the unemployed, the cost of all this work - including education costs has begun to be a problem.
It is estimated that it has reached £3.1 billion ($3.6bn) and from £2 billion
The problem of new ships is important when it is shown that German Navy forces are losing power.
Early in this year, Hans- Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament, admitted that the navy is "free of ships which can go into battle."
The officer says that the problem is older as it has been going on for years, as old ships have been discharged from the army but not new ones.
He then said that no other ship in the year Baden-Wuerttemberg was able to enter the navy.
New Trust listens to reports of flying creatures like rats
A new exhibit in the Scotish Highlands seeks to explain how the animals are using their position to obtain food.
It is hoped that the results will shed light on the behavior and safety of these animals.
This is a scientific study conducted by the Scottish National Trusts to follow these familiar animals, making them as hot as shoprano, with long ears and Daubetons in Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special typewriters will be placed in the main area so that they will be visible what they are doing during the year.
The NHS staff and volunteer workers will study the facilities with handheld machines.
Audio experts will examine the record in order to identify the animal frequency that they call together and what this type of behavior does.
A map of the habitat of these children and a record will be made to provide a picture of the behavior of these animals.
Rob Dewar, safety consultant for NTS Environment, hopes that the results will be to see the coming of the species to enjoy the environment of any kind.
These details will help us to see what benefits there are in protecting zoos and how to preserve wildlife habitats.
The existence of animals in Scotland and UK has decreased in the past 100 years.
They are at risk for the development and development of the habitats of these animals.
Airborne Turbines and light can pose risks to these animals as well as flying papers and chemicals from buildings, as well as cat attacks.
These creatures are not blind.
Even so, the demand for food for day - to - day attention is greater than their eyes when it comes to holding food.
They find their food in a rage when they come back to their ears with the senses of what food they see or when they fly.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 old areas, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land in the country, assumes that these animals are important.
It consists of ten trained experts, making retrials, reviewing their living quarters and sometimes rescues.
The park has made a unique exhibit in Scotland at Treave state state at Dumfries and Galloway, with eight species of animals
The director of the site, David Thompson, says that this is the right location for them
"Here in Trreave we have a beautiful place of these animals," he says.
"We have old areas, old trees and comfortable living quarters.
There is much that you can know about animals that no one knows, so the work we do here and other places will help us to explain what they need to live."
He says that the value of testing these animals before caring for the environment is important, since if they are injured, 400 lost children, who can complete the rest of that type.
These animals are protected and forbidden to commit suicide, to interfere with their abuse, and to cause harm to themselves and their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, the Scot Conservation Trust officer, encouraged the community to assist.
He said: "We still have much to know about these animals and how many of them we don't know."
Ronaldo refutes charges of torture and his agents to make a German magazine
Cristiano Rolando calls the alleged rape charges as a lie, claiming that people want to make his name known.
His agents will hire the German news agency Der Spiegel, which is the main source of these charges.
The Portuguese and Juventunsis have been accused of raping an American, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in 2009
He is said to have paid $375,000 for not reporting the event, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
Referring to the Instagram which has spread to 142 million followers after a few hours of these charges, Ronaldo, aged 33, dismisses himself as "false."
"Que, only, only, only, only.
What they have said today, it is absolutely false," this winner of the Ballon d'Or five times said to the camera.
"They want to introduce themselves to people in my name.
It is normal.
They want to be known by my name, but that’s not what I’ve been doing now.
I am happy and just, and add this player to my laughter.
The attorneys of Ronaldo said they were prepared to pay for the Der Spiegel these charges that said "an unacceptable report on charges that exploit private life," according to Reuters.
Justice Christian Schertz says that the player wants to give up a "spiritual disaster due to the abuse of personal rights over the years."
The event is said to have happened in June 2009 at a hotel called Palms Hotel and Casino at Las Vegas.
After meeting in a bar, Ronalddo and Mayorga are said to go to the player’s room, where he was raped in the back, according to papers put in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Miyarga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and was "right" 99 percent of the problem is 1 percent."
The lungs say that Ronalddo made sure that the couple stayed together, but they agreed.
Miyarga says she went to the police and took pictures of their injuries at the hospital, but later they agreed by arguing outside the courts because she felt afraid she would get back and fear being humiliated.
This 34 - year - old says that he wants them to come back to him because he says he’s still hurting himself.
Ronalddo was about to join the Real Madrid from Manchester United when this case occurred, and in this manner he went to the large Italian group Juvenunsis for a total of £100 million.
Brexit: UK will ‘ forever regret it ’ for the loss of vehicle producers
The UK will be “to regret forever ” if it does not lose its leading position in the development of cars after Brexit, says engineer Greg Clark.
Adding to the concern that Toyota in UK has told BBC that Britain can travel to the EU on the other side of the interview will slowly stop to develop their farm in Burkaston, near Derby.
"We need a connection," says Mrz. Clark.
The manufacturer of cars from Japan said that the pressure to slow down the flow of goods is limited when there is little association in Brexit can finish the task.
The Burnaston production – which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis – has produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90 percent of those eyes were taken to other countries in the European Union.
"It is my motto that if Britain is moving through the EU at the end of the Mashi we will see the introduction ceaseing from our development, says Marvin Cooke, the administrator of Toyota in Burma.
Some UK car producers have expressed their fears about the travel of the EU with no connection, including the Honda, BMW and the Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, says that it will close its Day output at Oxford for about a month after Brexit.
Serious concern about this can also pose a threat to the trade when there is no link in the Brexit.
The Toyota development list is conducted by the process of "Time," with cars arriving every 37 minutes from sales from the UK and EU for the purpose of making cars ready for the purchase immediately.
Even if the UK is moving through the EU without a union in 29 March, there may be an interruption in the border where the industry can be more likely to have delays and clothes that are not available.
It will not be possible for Toyota to have enough clothes to fit their appearance in Derbyshire, the business, and the industry will stand up.
Mr. Clark said that the program for Theresa May and the EU is "which is intended to not be considered in this field of testing."
"We need a connection. We want a very good combination that will allow us to take this time," which tells radio 4 of BBC on a team called Today.
"Experts not only from Toyota but also other producers explain that we need to continue where we have been in full development."
Toyota does not appear about how long the production will last, and over the long term, he warns that the rising cost will reduce the capacity of competition in time to finish the job.
Peter Tsoullavis, who has worked for Burnatonton for 24 years and who has signed the UN on this screen, says that they are concerned again. "The time I have worked I know that when this work goes, it will never return."
The public speaker says: "Give us a reliable plan for future unions with the EU.
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be resumed, says the office of the president of the United States
The special conference of Donald Trump and the general lawyer Rod Rosenstein can be postponed one week as in which the election of high court Brett Kavanaugh continues, says the president.
Rosenstein holds special counselor Robert Mueller, who does research on Russian elections, as well as the convention between Trump’s shoulders and Russia and to interfere with the legal arm of the president
Whether Trump chased him away from the attorney general, putting Mueller’s independence at risk, has been the cause of much of the gossip in Washington these past months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein said he would wear an item to record a conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the president with a solution 25
Rosenstein called up his report.
But on the last day he went to the White House, between the reports and will cancel.
Instead, meeting with
Trump said that he did not choose to drive the Roytentein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid confrontation in the Commite Heriing Senate where Kavanaugh and one of the other witnesses accused of sexual immorality, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave a testimony.
On Friday, Tup has authorized the investigation of the FBI for one week on charges against Kavanaugh, which has caused him to mispronounce the full set of Seenate.
The columnist for Trump, Nks Sarah Sanders, appeared in the Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein conference, he said: "The day you are not used, otherwise this week, I saw that a week’s return was given all other things in the high court.
But I will see and always like to keep the pressure renewed. "
Some scholars disagree with this: The Sanders did not carry the White House line from 10 in September.
The cyclone Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that no explanation was due to the confusion of the "magnified TV merchants," although he said: "I won't agree with what they look at."
She advised that the direct link between the Trump and the mount line.
"The president made Q&A sessions and sessions better than any president before," he added without counting: "Look at those numbers."
Reports will happen, Sanders said, but "if the printer has the opportunity to ask the president of America directly, it is better than to talk to me.
We try to do that and have seen him do a lot in the last few weeks and will take the place of the press when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump always handles questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or connects conferences with moving programs.
Solo news conferences are a disaster.
In New York this week the president may have indicated why, making freewheeling and some invisible times before meeting the news.
The Department of Health writes to the EU staff in NHS Scotland regarding Brexit fear
The Secretary of Health wrote to the Scottish EU staff in NHS to express their gratitude for the country and wish that they remain in the Post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP has sent a letter in less than six months to the extent that the UK has dropped to the EU.
The government of Scotland has devoted itself to meeting the cost of the EU environmental applications that live in the public service.
In his letter, Nsz Freeman wrote: "In the summer, discussions between the UK and the EU on the transfer have continued, focusing on possible decisions in the summer.
But the UK State has created its plans for an impossible situation.
I know this should be very disturbing to all.
That is why I want to regain my appreciation for the contribution made by the entire team, regardless of the country.
The brothers from all over the EU, and more, bring with them important experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit the sick and the people we use.
Skotland is your residence and we want you to stay here. "
Abercrombie Chrisby Ingos Surgery Emergency After After Hering Head Injry
The Tennessee State Ibacker Chris U Abercrombie was selected immediately after the abuse of the head on Saturdays of 31-27 in Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ.
Queen Rust Reed of Tennessee tells the press that injury occurred early in the short term.
"She came to the line of the case and fell down," says Reed.
The trainers and medical personnel provide the Abercrombie oxygen on the pre-planture and restore him to test.
The officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was not opened to the Vanderit Medical Centre.
Harris adds that there is no "extensive information about type / scope of injury at present" and that Tennessee State tries to find out when damage occurs.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore (Junier at the University, but only in their 2th year of college football), the first break and the State of Tennessee after being transferred to Illinois.
She had five fleets on Saturdays before she was out of the game, which gave her full time to 18 difficulties.
The purchase of the UK property will be paid for the purchase of other payments.
Outer buyers will be paid when they buy the UK property and additional funds used to assist the homeless under the new Tory plans.
The increase will reduce the success of Corbyn in steering to attract small voters.
The increase in the office work will be paid to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Department is expected to rise to £ 120 million per year to assist the homeless.
Marketers are used to pay high prices for the office services in the UK - as well as for additional funds used to help the homeless, Theresa May will bring it to our day.
The increase will appear to be an attempt to reduce the success of the Jeremy Corbyn drive to attract small voters with commitments to provide for purchased houses and focus on the obtaining of higher ones.
The increase in the farm work will be paid by people and nonpayee offices in the UK, as well as an additional boost to Russia’s driving against sleep.
In addition to the present housing service, including high levels imposed two years ago in the homes of two families and for the purchase of an additional 30 percent.
Nodybo is expected to climb up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new buildings built in London are purchased by the UK population, to run costs and make it difficult for the first buyer to gain foot at the level of houses.
Many of the world’s rich areas — especially in capitals — have become "city" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend their time in the country.
A new policy will come after weeks after Boris Johnson asked that the stamp be removed to help new people have their homes.
He persecutes large firms in the construction of high property costs by removing land but not using it, and he begged Nksz May to leave the platforms in the purchase homes to repair Britain's "house shame".
Mr. Corbyn has brought out a list of proposed housing repairs, including the control of the continent and the end of the production.
He also wants to offer many big committees to build new homes.
Nksz May said: "Last year I said I would give your premiership to restore the British dream - that life would be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing the house - to - house business.
Britain will always be open to people who want to stay, work, and build life here.
However, it would not be suitable for the blind in the UK, as well as for outside - laid companies, to buy homes as hardworking British citizens.
For so many people the dream of homelessness has become very distant, and the destruction of painful sleep remains real.
Jack Ross: 'My upper breast is controlling Scotland'
The Sunderland administrator Jack Ross says that "his high desire" is to be the Scottish administrator at some point.
The Scotts, 42, explains the challenge of restoring the north-east club, which is now living in the third place in the League One, three of them lay up.
He moved to the Stadium of Light on the peninsula after leading St Mirren to the Premiership of the Scotish Season.
I want to play my country as an athlete.
I have bull B and I said, "Ross has told BBC Scotland Sports.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Henden and being like a child, and it remains my protection.
That opportunity will come, however, if I succeed in the rule of the spider.
The tops of Ross as head of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio
The former head of the Alloa Atthletic states that he did not have the courage to follow the broken names in the main library, which has already discarded areas from Barnsley and Ipswich City.
"The success to me at this time will be followed by 'May I restore this library to the Governor League?'
Because of the construction and facilities in the game, no doubt in the Premier League, he said.
"It’s not easy to find there, but I’ll probably just look at my success here if I go back to the group."
Ross for only three years in his administrative calendar, later as a helper to Dumbarton and 15 days in the Coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to break out of the third eye, and he changed St Mirren from a position of support for Championship in the following article.
And Ross says that he feels more comfortable than he did in Clyde, Hartlepolol, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"It was possible to be real," he recalls, by taking Aloa.
"I really believe the control is good for me, more than playing.
It sounds so good because I did well, had a good life in it, and I enjoyed it very much.
But playing can be a challenge.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I am still going so by the demands of stress and work pressure, but the control feels right.
I always wanted to be in control, and now I do that, I feel free to be in my wallet for all the elders in my life.

The total time of the pint is 5.30pm on Saturday, which the surveys see
The summer summer summer summer summers have encouraged the release of the heavy British bridges, but they are more crowded in the dining stores.
Groups of Pub and bar saw 2.7 percent selling by July - but consumption in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent, indicating the number.
Peter Martin, of the consulcy Business Business CGA, which included these figures, said: "The continuing of the sun and England for a long time rather than being expected to participate in the Council of the Republic of July followed the same example in the previous year of June, when the pubs rose by 2.8 percent, unless the dining areas were hit hard.
The loss of 1.8 percent of the market in June grew tremendously by July.
Drinking induction tubes and excess valves are more like preference for lower dining rooms.
Food- directed pubs were also destroyed by the sun, although they are not just as extreme as food drivers.
It seems that people want to get out of drinking.
Throughout the urbs and drinking bars, there were more than 6.6 percent per cent in the month, with a third-rate diet. "
Paul Newman, social analysts and tourists, RSM says: "These results continue with the wind we have seen since April.
The weather and the influence of major social or sports events are always the most important when it comes to the sale of foreign markets.
It is no wonder that businesses continue to fight, although the 4.8 percent of the annual market will be particularly painful at the cost of continuing expenses.
The hot summer did not come at a critical time for the proprietors and the time it will tell that the degrees taken by August will provide much breathing.
The general increase in the market in the pub and stores, including the new opening, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating the improvements in blackouts.
The Coffer Peach Tradeer of the UKpub company, the bar and the division of the food department collects and analyzes the data from 47 working groups, as well as the combined cost of more than £9 million, and the default medical assessment.

The postal declaration by comparing mothers with cows to the Internet view.
The breast-pipe pump company divides the concept of trade online with an advertisement that identifies young mothers from cattle held in custody.
To establish the introduction of what is called the first "bribable bamp," Elvie's technical company has released the title of the Music-in-cheek video presentation to show the new freedom that the pop-up offers to express mothers.
Four mothers have a dance on a bon filled with cattle - like, including sounds like "Yes, I’m dancing, but you don't see the tail" and "If you didn't notice these things, it isn't."
The chorrus continues: "Pimp it, pop up, I feed the infant, pump, pump, pump, and put my daughters in it."
However, the advertisements, printed on the file page, are online for online conflict.
In 77,000 and hundreds of visions, this video has received mixed answers to viewers, many say that it means "duction" in the milk industry.
"An appropriate solution is using cattle to announce this product.
Just as they have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, unless their babies are called before the days of conception, ‘ write one. ’
The breast gun is closely paralleled inside the storage container (Elvie / mother)
One said: “The mother and the child are directly concerned.
But yes, why not use them to publish pop popps to mothers who will save their children?
Another person added: "Not seen in sales."
Others defend the declaration, a woman who admits that she has found a song that is "clean."
"I think this is a human opinion.
I will have one if I fill it.
Spiraling made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is somewhat painful, but I took it.
This is the product of the mind, "one wrote.
One said: "This is an exciting advertisement aimed at the mothers who are pumps (normally in their operating or private areas) and feel like ‘ cows'.
This is not a declaration praising or judging the milk industry.
At the end of the video, a team of detectives showed that all were playing with the infamous pumps.
The final theme of the campaign is based on the idea that many women who are known to have established their own feelings as cows.
Elvie Pimp, then, is completely silent, there is no wafer or falls and is consistent within the bridge of shelter, gives women freedom to walk, hold their children, and go out.
Ana Bararin, the ECD and Mother said: "Elvie steam is the product of a revolution that was worthy of the introduction of liver and touch.
By demonstrating the similarity between women and milk cows we wanted to put on the birth bites and all obvious challenges, when it reflected how exciting and what a new freedom would be.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump made a head.
During the Callon week of Mondoon, the mother of two children appeared on the desigrk kettelk of the designer Martha Jabowski while using this product.

The number of children used to migrate have moved out although the moon limits remain constant, in view of the division of heavy control and control procedures made by the Trump control systems make it difficult to place children and those who support them.
According to tradition, many advocates have become foreign, and they have threatened their ability to live in the country by further naming a child.
The risk increased in June, when government authorities announced that supporters who would benefit from them and other adult members in their homes had to install fingerprints, and if the plate was to be joined by the authorities.
Over the past week, Mateu Alberance, the highest authority and the Transition of the Highways and the Transport of the Roads, testified before the Conference that the Aerente holds many people who apply for support of non-compliant children.
The Council later ensured that 70 per cent of the arrests did not contain reports of crime.
"Approximately 80 per cent of the participants or members of the family who support the country illegally, and the great majority of the foreigners are lawmakers.
So we continue to pursue those people, "Thus says Mr. Albence.
In order to improve children quickly, the officials promise new laws that will require others to appear in court within a specified month, soon after 60 days, the first, the first requirements, according to the staff of the residence.
Many will appear on the phone booth, rather than in person, to justify their part of the law in the immigration judge.
Those who are considered unworthy of freedom will soon be removed.
For a long time, children can be in the cell, they may feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to eventual or escape, according to vacation workers and reports that have appeared on the program in the months to come.

Faced with the United Nations Assembly, foreign Minister Wald al-Mouelem also called the Syrian refugees home, although the civil war is now in the eighth year.
Mouelem, also serving as governor, has declared that the foreign armies in the province of Syria are illegal, under the sense of combating violence, and "will be taken properly."
"They must quickly and unauthorized," said the congregation.
Mouelem insisted that the "war is raging in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died in 2011, and millions of other people were displaced.

France has more than 1,000 wars in the world in a war - torn country
In the case of the refugees, Mouelem said these restrictions were ready to return, and he said, "Some countries in the West" because of spreading the irrational fear that makes refugees far away.
"We have called the international and social organizations to provide for this cost," he said.
"They have made it a matter of concern to the public."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no refits in Syria until there is a political treaty between the Assad and opposition to the end of the war.
The UN links say that the new agreement between Russia and Turkey is to be established at the level of the tappos, the great Idib personal library created an opportunity for political advancement.
The Russian-Turethan language launched a massive attack on the well - to - do Russians, where three million people lived.
Mouelem but emphasized that the agreement was "long-time" and expressed hope that the participation of the war will concentrate on the rodisdisists, including the Al-Qaeda-Contians associated with Nusra Front, "destruction."
The UN ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon he will include the first meetings of a new committee organized by the members of the government and opposition to create the principle of the war in Syria and to guide the course of choice.
Mouelem put conditions on the cooperation of the Syrian Government to the committee, saying that the committee's work should be restricted by the "reviewing of the current constitution," and warned against disturbances.

U.S. Fit the Penaligning El Salvador With Chinese Support, then supported
The diplomas say that the Republic of Rominican and Panama have chosen Beijing, not to leave Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with Prime Minister Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partner released the Trump Organization’s ruling party.
Officials of the State Department have decided to restore the American delegates to El Salvador, the Rominican Republic, and Panama regarding "prejudicial decisions soon to be destroyed to see Taiwan," says Heather Nauert, who speaks for the Department, in the state of the month.
But sentences were considered only about El Salvador, which received $140 million about American acid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
Planners, which include the election of financial support and the limits to which they are intended, would be sorry in the North American country and the absence of high duties and death rates.
As the inner meetings progressed, North American and North American officials have postponed high security and economic development to follow the same conference last year that was considered to be a major step against the migrants to the United States.
But during September, the highest administrative officers explained that they wanted the court to continue, completely eliminating any assessment of El Salvador's trials.

What will we do if Mr. Trump smoke the President Rod Rosenstein, a man in charge of Mr Mueller's Future of Inquiry?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since the paper said, last year, she was secretly advised to write the president and give undue explanation to the office.
Mr Rosenstein says that the Times account is wrong.
"How will we respond when a recent investigation asked for the FB.I. Brett Kavanough survey does not keep up or should be confirmed in the Supreme Court despite the solemn charge of sexual assault and false evidence?

I did not do it. "
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you pay?
Remember her reply... does you blow a volume -o, "o, what?

He probably did not, but it was the worst kind of body I had seen.

He sees the meaning, injustice, ignorance of who is wrong, who must work to regain power and control, "Mediaite has declared the president.

He is not a race.
We are not racial, "husband Joel Plasco has told the Post.
‘ Would you not place your children in the hands of someone who was quick to respond, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come."

I am surprised now that we know about great success in Padding. "
His father, who worked as a BBC caramman before being inspired to write a book for children with a small tablet, said that he would be a man rare as to his rejected work, adding that 60 years this book was good "after his death last year.
In Paddington, describing it as "the most important member of the family," he added his father automatically trusted in his success.
"He was an old man, and he was not a proud man," he said.
"But because Padding was true to her, it was difficult for her to have a child who was perfect: she is proud of herself, even though she is not real.
I think he had watched Padding that way.
Although he was his creation and his idea, he always owed him his debt to Paddington himself. "

Two women who lost a loved one to commit suicide tried to protect others from taking their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards to Welsh Bridge and encouraging messages and phone numbers that people might call for support.
Nkss Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began depression and suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I would feel daily," he said.
Nksz Davis, who is 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that his son was a promising cook with an infectious disease.
"Everyone knew his face because of his smile.
They were always talking about her smile."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was in the dark.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the only one who could have met his brother after he had died.
Nksz Davis said: "I always worry that there will be a special knock."
Ms Davis created cards, "to allow people to know that there are people outside where you can talk to them, and to be friends.
Don’t keep quiet - you have to talk."
Nksz Humphreys, who has been a friend to Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, his 15 - year - old companion, shortly after Mother’s death.

The future of Brett Kavanough depends on a record as the FBI begins research.
"I thought, if we could find something similar to what he asked for - time research, it is limited in time - perhaps to enter a small unity," says Mr Flake on Saturday, he added that he was running the committee "diffraction" between the mixed gridlock.
Why does Mr Kavanough and his Republic’s supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Not all of their demands are due to time.
The choice of the latter one for five weeks, on November 6 - that, as is expected, the Riphabshkis are doing bad things, so they will become very weak in their efforts to find a man who wants to be elected to the world’s highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling on the telephones, asking them to cooperate with Mr Kanaugh, who worked in the West House on Mr Bush and met him with his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What happened after the FBI reported it?
There will be a vote in the Seenate, where the Republics and Democratics now sit down.
It is still not clear that Mr Kanaugh can reach 50 votes on the floor of the Seenate, which will allow Mike Pennce, the president of the president, to break the case and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Defor's number was down under Kim
The number of officials of North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un was strong seven years ago, said that the South Korean attorney said.
A park in Ezeong-seug, which mentioned the date from South social service, said there was a security of 1,127 last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the control is relatively limited between North Korea and China and the higher levels paid by the main suppliers.
The Pyonganger did not make public opinion.
Most of the losses from North are eventually donated by South Koreans.
The Seoul says that more than 30,000 people in North Korea have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled in China, the longest border in North Korea and easy to cross over the Dilitsed Zone (DMZ) Region (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China is referred to as illegal migrants rather than refugees and repeatedly return.
The relationship between the North and the South - who have served officially in the war-equity in the coming months.
Just before this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyonggang with talks that focused on a get - together discussion.
This appeared after the Juni conference between the American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they generally agreed to work on the Korean flag without a nucleus.
But on Saturday, North Korean Minister R Yong-ho states that the US sentences are due to a lack of progress.
"Without faith in the United States, there will be no hope for our national security and, under such circumstances, no way will we first exploit it," says Mr R.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "Trinte," saying she is not ready to serve in the Supreme Court.
The head of the House of General Nancy Pelosi called the high Court Chief Bret Kavanau "ttengh" and said he would not qualify to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelus answered a Saturday talk in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help you, but I think if a woman has done that way, they're going to say, 'Fight,' Pelosi has said about her answer to Kavanough' before the Court's Commission on Thursday.
The Kavanaughangh was officially admitted to having had sexual intercourse with Dr. Christine Blesey Ford when they were young.
At the opening session, Kavanaugh felt very nervous, at times shouting and associating with his family and his high school years.
He clearly condemned democracy on the committee, calling for his criticism of the "sub-conservative and human co-ordination" maintained by the most important institutions that Hillary Clinton lost a national election in 2016.
Pelosi believed in Kavanough's evidence that she could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it indicated that she was being abused in Democrats.
"I think you are prepared for such questions and how the Corinthians and Democracy are followed," he said.
Pelus was stressed when he was asked that he would try to interfere with Kavanaugh, and that the Democracy had more in the House of Representatives.
"I'll mean this - if he doesn't tell the truth in the Congress or the FBI, then he isn't qualified to be the Supreme Court, but if he is in court at present," Pelos said.
The Kavanaugh still judge in D.C.
The Pelosi added that as a democracy she was concerned about the judgment of Kavanaugh Act or Roe v. She was tall, as it is considered to be the righteousness to keep.
In confirming his arrest, the Kavanaugh had answered questions as to whether he could change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time for a dangerous, private person to go to court and wait for us to say, 'It', said Pelosi.'
And women want to protect it.
The diesel is good, month and year of burning, and cannot do it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrss Steinem said to me afterward.
'Don't think something unusual, won't you?'
He continued, "I was helped greatly by a woman in a certain position, who cried when she too cried, but she developed a procedure that meant that when she was full and started to cry, she said to her companion, "You think I’m sorry because I cry.
I'm angry.'
And he kept on going.
And I thought it was wise.
Tears are allowed as a source of irritation over something because of misunderstanding.
One of my sharpest memories of my first job, in the man’s office, where I had found crying out in utter fits, was caught by the cruff on my neck by an elderly woman; I always feared very much — who dragged me to the stage.
"Don't let them see their tears," he told me.
"He doesn't know that you are angry.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they come to you.
Patricia Schroeder, then the Democratmoman of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his administrative role.
In 1998, when Mr Hart was caught in a shelter outside a ship called Shiny Bay and left the race, Nksz Schroeder, was very concerned, he might have felt that there was no reason for him to get the idea of running the president himself.
"There was no logical decision," he told me to laugh some 30 years later.
"There were seven heard in the competition, and the last thing they wanted was one.
One called "Snow White and Seven Popular."
Because it was after the project, it was after financial support, and she vowed that she would not enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his clients who contributed 1,000 to the men would give him only $250.
"Do they think I get the lose?" she wondered.
When he made his statement that he would not perform a legitimate service, he was overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude to the people who have supported him, frustration and a system that makes it more difficult to raise money and aim voters than delegates, and anger in sedism - if he became mature.
"You think I would be disturbed," recalls Nksz Schroeder about how the printer responded to him.
"You think Kleex was my partner.
I remember thinking, will they lay my rock?
"You cried"? "
How the US-Y China War may be a good thing in Beijing

China has promised to compare US smoking-short-short-shot, and an abundance of the world’s economy will not be able to combine any time in the short term.
To find Washington back means to take it, but to submit to the United States would be very embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards properly, forced U.S. military operations can certainly help China over a long time by reducing dependence on other countries.
"It is true that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that begin to dump the economy in this country is indeed more dangerous than viewers have seen before," says Abigail Grace, an independent companion headed for Asia, says the New American Security Culture, a thinking tanks.
