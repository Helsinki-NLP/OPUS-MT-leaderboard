Stars emit light and heat as a result of energy produced when hydrogen atoms combine (or mix) together to form heavier elements.
Scientists are trying to develop a biological factor that can make energy just as efficient.
This, however, is a difficult problem to solve and it will take years before we see a combination of elements being created.
The iron needle is floated over the water because of elasticity of atoms.
The slightness is because the atoms of water over the water are much stronger than the air they form over them.
Water compounds form an invisible skin in the water that allows the needlelike structure to split into the water.
