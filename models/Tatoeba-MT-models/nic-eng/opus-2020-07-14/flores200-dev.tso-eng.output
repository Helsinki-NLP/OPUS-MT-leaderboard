An iron needle pierces through the water with its powerful force.
The power to hold fast is possible because the water molecules on the water are much closer than they are to the spiritual molecules on the surface.
Water molecules make an invisible skin over water that allows a magnetic field to float over the water.
The iron in the ammonium of these days consists of two parts attached to each other. The two parts give it the right to hold the ice, even when it is flexible.
