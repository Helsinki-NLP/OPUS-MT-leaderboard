and all chest pain should be treated in this way especially in your years of life
with fever
and you need to check your blood pressure.
Do you now have a fever?
and do you have this chest pain now?
and if you have respiratory trouble
and can you point to what other symptoms you have with this?
and your fever is as high as number.
and holding my head and hands
I also have a fever and a small cough
and my chest pains today
and whether this is the best time to develop the fever caused by dry grass
and have severe chest pains
I think I have a small fever
and I want you to explain where it hurts
they also suffer from certain fevers
for your history of diabetes
and know that my heart is going to be depressed
and you know that people are always clinging to me
and feel pain in the chest
and said that this is a pressure on your chest

or what other symptoms or problems you identify with the pain of your joints?
Are there other sick people like you in your home who have similar symptoms?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Is he dealing with a lack of breath?
if you still have chest pains
because this is a cold season
and should not be set aside for heartfelt pain

An event of rapid growth of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
A growing event of coronavirus conditions (COVID-19) shows the same rates in European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom to ensure that, although in different regions of the world, the accident of COVID-19 is going on rapidly throughout the world.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals, and emergency - care units should increase the willingness to accept many COVID - 19 patients who will need health care, and especially the care of those in dire situations.
In 31 December 2019, a group of people with non-experimental properties was reported at Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the component responsible for the new coronavirus is now called a sere respiration syndrome unit 2 (SARS-CV-2).
Since then, the resulting disease of SARS-CV-2 has been named cronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence thus far indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 suffer from a serious illness, that is, a respiratory disorder associated with or not associated with pneumonia, and most of these people are recovering.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 is developing into a very serious illness that requires hospitalization while 6% of the remaining cases face a serious emergency need attention.
The death of victims of COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine the accounts of the growing development of COVID-19 in each European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those in the Hubei Province, China.
It also compares the current number of people with COVID-19 in the EU/EA and UK and that of Italy during January 15 March 2020.
In the EU/EA and UK, the circumstances of the COVID-19
After China, the COVID-19 spread widely in areas and the change in the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide is currently following what is taking place in the country.
On March 11, 2020, the General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is a epidemic.
The 5 March calendar of the Eurosurvellance 2020, Spiri et al. reported the first confirmed COVID-19 European that matches WHO's definition.
In EU/EA, the first confirmed people reported to France on 24 January 2020 to persons from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
By March 15, 2020, COVID-19 people had been found in all 30 countries of EU/EA and the United Kingdom (UK), that is, between 31 December 2019 and that day, 39,768 people with the virus and 1,727 dead persons, this time 17,750 infected with the virus and 1,441 dead were reported only in Italy.
Identifying an increasing number and increasing event of the circumstances of COVID-19
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), statistics of people with COVID-19 in each country worldwide, obtained only by legal resources such as the Department of Health for each country, the national and regional health authorities and WHO, are restored each day by 8:00 a.m.
This date was used in analyzing the COVID-19 EU/EA and UK, and compared with those in Italy.
As a representative of the exception of the ongoing COVID conditions, we calculate the currently cut event of 14 days of the OVID-19 circumstances, thus considering the natural progress of COVID-19, in each EU/EA and UK, during January 1,–15 March 2020.
It also introduces an increasing number of national statements on 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. in comparison with Italy at 31 January 15, March 2020.
EU/EA and UK
The growing rent of 14 days of the COVID-19 situations in the EU/EA and UK countries usually follow those of the Hubei Province (China 1).
All over the EU/EA and the UK, the growing event of the COVID-19 began to climb on about 21 February and increased greatly on 28 February 2020.
This is greatly increased by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EA and UK countries show the same high rates for the growing event of COVID-19.
The image 2 shows an increasing number of the circumstances of the COVID-19, in the EU/EA and UK countries compared with that of Italy during January 31, February 15, March 2020.
It highlights that, on 15 March 8:00 a.m., some 15 countries of the EU/EA and UK had already reported a total total of less than that of Italy in three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of recorded circumstances of the COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The costs marked in the growing event of the COVID-19 show that the epidemic is continuing at the same speed throughout the world.
This is despite the fact that countries are divided in different ranks, the different health reactions of the community, and probably different definitions of conditions in various countries as well as various protocol to choose patients to be tested to ensure a COVID-19, which includes follow - up tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation where 10% of COVID - 19 patients needed attention and the media reported that hospitals and emergency units in these areas had reached their peak.
The data for importing COVID-19 in the hospital as well as/or a unit of emergency care is found in the EU/EA section of 6% and 1%, respectively (dadata is not shown).
It should, however, be gathered in an orderly way to correspond to the current date date that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a great difference in the availability of emergency and central care for Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portuguese society.
This means that the countries may have more or less facilities than Italy (12.5 emergency and central care beds for 100,000 people by 2010/11).
Copying the factors associated with the prevalence of health care, which provides the average of each EU/EEA and UK for the increase of conditions in the hospital due to COVID-19, 90% of the number of emergency - care beds, is given a sixth reduction of the ECDC scans in terms of COVID-19.
As conditions accumulate in certain areas in the EU/EA and UK countries, and emergency hospitals and units often help some people to read, knowledge about the circumstances and emergency care beds should be available at the extent of the Nordicial units for statistics 2 (UNTS-2).
The experiences of Italy and the current international and foreign restaurants show that the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly growing in the EU/EA and the UK.
The countries, hospitals and units of care must prepare for the ongoing cooperation of the manager of SARS-CV-2 and the increase of COVID - 19 patients who need medical attention, and especially emergency care, such as that takes place in the affected areas of Italy.
As shown in a recent study of an emergency, a quick, active, and active way is important to delay the circulation of SARS-COV-2, by changing the control system to a lower order, since the expected rapid increase in the number of conditions may not enable decisionmakers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response to the proper way if they can be used in time.
An emergency investigation also calls for public health measures to control the effect of the epidemic.
There is a small gap in which nations are unable to maintain their control efforts to reduce the progress of SARS-CV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
The failure of this, some EU/EA clinics may be faced by a number of patients who need emergency care in the days or weeks to come.
The outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a sere respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CV-2), is currently killing more than 3,000 people and affecting more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, which has succeeded in disaster in people.
According to the same virus, SARS-CV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CV-2 may also be passed from bats and caused similar symptoms.
COVID-19, however, has a more serious risk and mortality rate than SAS but is much more passed and is treating more adults than is new and more male than women.
As a response to the fast - growing number of new cases in publication, the article tries to offer a time - and - depth return with regard to a rapidly progressing research article.
We will discuss basic factors concerning epidemiology, elology,ology, diagnosis, treatment, cause, and prevention of disease.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that this restoration helps to understand and to eliminate the threat posed by the threat.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who are encouraged to stay in their homes on vacation and for many weeks thereafter due to the outbreak of the outbreak of the new virus.
The virus is much like the coronavirus (Cov) that caused the outbreak of a sere respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and a related disease was called COV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The plague began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world and in some 50 others around the world.
On March 2, 2020, the virus led to the more than 80,000 confirmed conditions of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients released from the hospital and more than 3,000 patients who died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "a leading public enemy" and may be more powerful than terrorism.
According to Pub Med (https:/wwww.nlbi.nlm.nov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 pages were printed about its COVID-19 which includes its biology, epidemiology, eelology, tests, and treatment since the first report on January 7,20.
This review tries to compensate for the progress of research in connection with a new and rapid development.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS with another disease caused by CV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012).
We will also consider what we have learned so far about prevention and the causes of disease and yet other vital questions.
CVs generally regarded as non-inflammatory pthogens in humans, mainly responsible for 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have had two major cases with COVs, namely, SARS-CV and MERS-CV, which caused a plague that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, in sequence, and soon spread to other countries that caused serious illness and death.
Therefore, the present COVID-19 is the third outbreak of COV in human history.
As shown in Death. As.1.1.1, previously unknown sources of lemons began to be reported at Wuhan on December 31, 2019 in China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the coV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death event was reported at Wuhan.
In the meantime, the plague spread rapidly in neighboring cities, districts, and countries.
On January 20, a combination of health workers was reported, suggesting that interconnection was possible.
On January 23, the town of Wuhan was closed and all public transport equipment was established.
On January 24 the first medical study of the disease reported that, of the 41 patients whose condition is confirmed, only 21 had a direct connection with the Wuhan food market that was first considered a disease from an unknown source.
On January 30, WHO announced the outbreak of a global health emergency.
By the time of the report, the disease has spread throughout China and about 50 countries around the world (Death.2).
As the situation deteriorates rapidly, both the end and the magnitude of the pandemic are unknown.
On February 11, 2020, a study of the many 8,866 patient centers that included 4,021 who were convinced to be infected with COVID-19 showed a more recombinant picture of the epidemic in the following way (https: /m.m.q.com/s/s/UlBI-HP1HPqHHHHA2bbdA).
The SARS-CV-2 has been ill for people of all ages, but mainly 30-65 years.
About 47.7% of the cases were more than 50 years old, fewer than 20, and only 14 patients were less than 10.
The SARS-CV-2 has caused more men (001/100,000) than women.
The COVID-19 grew mainly in and around the Hubei.
The COVID-19 took an average of 5 days (2-9) from the beginning to the test.
The average duration of the burial period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from the beginning of death to nine days (4.8-13).
The basic removable number ($0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.555), and the modified R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people engaged increased rapidly before 23 Jan.20, which was similar to the time of a massive transport before the Spring Festival in China.
The death of confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% KI: 1.1.86%), and the number of deaths changed by all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main factors of the accident of COVID-19 were sex (men), age ( aggregate), and critical pneumonia.
The CVs are part of a family of large, hidden germs that contain a single RNA string of feeling.
It can be divided into four parts, namely the alpha, beta, gamma, and Delta, which is, that is, CEV elpah and beta are not known to affect people.
The Spike (S) package of glycoprotein adheres to angiotian-conning enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the pipe feeddyyl perptidase 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CV and MERS-CV, in sequence, then the combination of membranes.
The RNA gene is released from the ctoplansm; after a recombination of the gene gene, the RNA of a gene associated with the glycoprotein environment and the peer protein of nucleocapsid form synoles, which include the plasma membrane to release the virus.
A sequence of early SARS-CV-2 genetic elements was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-Cov-2 was found to be a new type of beta-Cov with 99.98% of the ten successive samples gathered at the first target site, the Huanaan Seaod Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CV-2 is usually more similar to SARS-CV than MERS-CV.
Using electron transmission microscopes, the SARS-CV-2 crystals were found in the most obvious parts of the eptelium for human airway movement.
The ACE2 people were found to be the SARS-CV-2-and-2-SARS-CV.
However, the SS S-COV-2 SARS unit includes an ACE2 human being much faster than that of SARS-CV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CV-2 causes less serious intervention on patients than SARS-CV.
The SARS-CV-2 can also rebuild a new fiber protein produced by the orchid and the released protein produced by the orf8.
The SARS-CV-2 might play a role in the virus-poundering and may prevent the appearance of IFN that is not possible; however, the orchid does not contain any known background or operating mode.
On February 18, 2020, Zou, et.l., reported the Cloo-EM structure of ACE2 people with a full height of 2.9 Å Å connected with the amino acid vehicle B0AT1.
It was found that these interconnected, open and closed buildings, were included as a dier and a combination of ACE2-B00AT1 is able to combine two S proteins, which provide evidence for the sight of the CV and attachment.
B00AT1 may be a medical unit in demination so that the SARS-CV-2 is pressed.
The origin and centre strides
It is known that both SARS-CV and MERS-CV began in the bats and passed on to the people through civet cats and speakers, one after another.
By comparison of SARS-CV-2 and other CVs, bats are recognized as the source of SARS-CV-2 as the new virus equals 96% with two CARS like SAL-CVZX45 bats and the SL-CVZX1.
However, the identity of any organization that stepped in helped the virus cross the border between creatures so that it can join the unknown, and the channel for transmission is still to be clearly identified.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes may be carrying the virus from bats to humans that involved a combination of the same factors within S.
According to research, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggest that pangolins - with long noses, mammals commonly used as Chinese folk medicine — they may be the central drug of SARS-CV-2 based based on 99% of the Cov products derived from pargolin and SARS-CV-2.
However, the contrast of 1% that is spread between two genes makes a big difference; therefore, the sure effects of strong femininity are maintained (Death.33).
SARS-CV-2 chemical elements are currently not known.
The SARS-CV and MERS-CV can live without a creature for 48 hours in a dry area and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%%%.
The SARS-CV-2 may have the same factors.
It is reported that SARS-CV-2 does not relate to ultraviolet radiation and 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% of ethanol, chlorinic bacteria, paracetic acid, chlorod, and other fuels, but not chlorophydine, can make the virus effective.
All the people generally lack immune defenses against SARS-CV-2 and therefore are in danger of acquiring a new virus.
At present, there is no detailed research on the response of the immune system to SARS-CV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to past studies of other COVs, especially SARS-CV and MERS-CV (Death.4).
Usually, after the infection has invaded the body, it is first identified by the natural receptors of the immune system (PRRs) that include the receptors such as C cactitors, a receptor such as Toll (TLR), a receptorlike receptor (ND), and a receptor similar to RIG (RR).
In different ways, the virus causes symptoms of inflammation, the development of endritic cells, and the production of interferrons of I (IFN) that suppress the spread of the virus and speed up the macrophage phogocytosis of the antigens.
However, N N'SARS-CV protocol can help the virus escape the response of the immune system.
In the near future, the adaptive response of the immune system joins the battle against the virus.
T lymphocytes that include DD4+ cells and CD8+ play an important role in protecting.
CD4+ T cells encourage B cells to produce antibodies against the virus, as well as CD8+ cells that directly kill infected cells.
The helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokine to help protect cells.
However, CV can prevent T cell function by producing an apoptosis of T cells.
The lack of the Humoral along with such aids as C3a and C5a as well as the immune system is also important in combating the virus.
For example, antibodies taken from a recovered patient make meRS-CV ineffective.
On the other hand, overstimated reactions of the immune system create large amounts of medical drugs in a place that can cause significant damage to the lungs and other body organs, and, in the worst case, the failure of many organs and even death.
SARS-CV-2, which has a primary factor as a group, has a number of chances of treating older people with moorbidiatics as well as pregnant women.
It is not uncommon for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have the immune system at risk, with more chance of becoming infected than other people.
The estimate for the SARS-CV-2 seasons is 1-14 days, often 3-7 days based on the study of the first 425 persons in Whan.
However, a survey of 1,099 people shows that the menstrual period was 3 days on average and had an average width of 0 to 24 days.
Recent research, as described above, has shown that the period of burial was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on the knowledge of 8,86 people.
It is very important for health authorities to change a period of silence based on the correct pronunciation, by which side people who are infected but who do not have signs of transmitting the virus to others.
As is common practice, people who are injured, or infected, have to be confined for 14 days.
Should the closing time be extended for 24 days?
The fever is usually a large first and first symptom of COVID-19, which may be incompatible with symptoms or other symptoms such as no cough, loss of breath, muscle pain, nausea, backaches, throat, throat, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia in one week after the onset of the disease.
In critical cases, patients have rapidly improved with severe respiratory infections, septic shock, metabolic acidis, and cogengopany.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as acute fever, even if there are no unusual characteristics seen in the wing image, should be screened for early tests.
A public - information study conducted at the end of December of 1920 showed a percentage of the symptoms that said 98% of fever, 76% of non-flammatory cough, 55% of dyspenia, and 3% of diarrhea; 8% needed to breathe with the aid of a machine.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of family groups as well as a group based on the failure of a person with no symptoms.
By comparison, a public study in 2012 showed that MERS-CV patients also had fever (98%), non-flammatory cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their primary symptoms.
However, 80% of them had to breathe with the aid of a machine, much more than the COVID-19 patients and that is in accordance with the far higher level of MERS murder than the COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and pain throat (21%) were also noted for MERS patients.
For SARS patients, it was shown that fever (29%%%), non-75%, dyspanea (240%), diarrhea (20-4%), and pain throat (13-25%) were major symptoms and breathing with the aid of machine was necessary for at least 14% of patients.
On February 14, the death caused by COVID-19 was 2% of the confirmed cases of disease to 6,576 worldwide.
By comparison, the deaths caused by SARS in November 2002 were 10% of all diagnosed cases confirmed by 8,096.
In the MERS, based on public information research in June 2012, death was 37% of the 2,494 patients.
The first survey reported that the R0 of SARS-CV-2 was high by 6.47 with 95% of the 5.71-7.23, where SARS-CV was the width from 2 to 4.
An SARS-CV-2-MERS-COV comparison with SARA-CV concerning their symptoms, death, and R0 is represented as The Table1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-CV-2 have a greater potential for explosives than MERS-CV and SAERS-CV, but is less lethal than both.
Therefore, it is far more difficult to manage the SARS-CV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CV and SARS-CV.
The onset of such clubs often takes place in the same family or at the same gathering or in transportation, such as a boat.
Patients usually have a history of visiting or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with people who are infected or patients two weeks later.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have been discharged from the hospital can also carry the virus, which gives a warning to increase the silent period.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells of peripheral (especially lymphocytes) in the first stages.
For example, the lymphopiania containing the number of white blood cells < 4 ×109/L that includes the number of lymphocytes < 1×109/L, as well as the higher levels of the amartate amnotranspherase and thevilemia found in 1,099 patients with OVID-19.
The levels of liver and liver enzymes and myoglobin were high in the blood of some patients, and C-reative protein and erethrocyte code were high in the blood of many patients.
For patients with serious illnesses, D-dier level, the product of the breakdown of fibr in blood, was high, and the rate of lymphocyte was dramatically reduced.
An unusual discovery was found in the radiography of many patients with a COVID-19 and with two-posal side effects or gray glas through the lungs.
Patients are often affected by unusual pneumonia, critical lung damage, and acute respitory stress syndrome (ARDS).
When the ARDS occurs, uncontrolled swellings, liquid growth, and progressive fibrosis endanger the gas exchange.
The wrong performance of I and the type of pneuccyte reduces the level of surfactant and increases the tension of the upper area, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increase the risk of lung loss.
Thus, the worst results of radioography are often similar to the most serious condition of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first polyological analysis of COVID-19 showed the outbreak of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membrane, and the introduction of interstitial lymphocyte, as well as the introduction of multured syncytial cells on the bones of a terminally ill patient, accompanied by a viral Pathology and ARDS and similar to those of SARS and MARS patients.
The discovery of SARS-CV-2 using reverse-transcritase polymerase (RT-PCR) was used as a major test case for COVID-19.
However, because of the high percentage of non-productive poisoning, which may speed up the epidemic, medical visibility began to be used when a test (not only on RT-PCR) in China on February 13,20.
A similar situation arose when a SARS test appeared.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, medical evidence, laboratory tests, and radar results is important and important for successful testing.
On February 14, 2020, the Fong Zhang team described the SERLOCK protocol based on the CARS-COV-2 to discover SARS-COV-2, finding non-CV2 non-natural sections of SARS-2 on 20 × 10-18 mol/20 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies for each installed frames) are used by a rod at an hour without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that a new approach will greatly enhance empathy and benefits if assurance is made of medical samples.
Because of a lack of experience with the new COV, doctors can primarily be able to provide support for COVID - 19 patients, while trying a variety of methods used or raised earlier to treat some COVs such as SARS-CV and MERS-CV and other infectious diseases (ITHELA2).
This treatment includes current and possible antimicrobial therapy, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from patients, Chinese medicine, and mental - health professionals.
Even a suggestion is made to use the plasma of patients as a treatment.
Carmaceutical firms compete with one another to form antibodies and antiviral goals.
SARS-CV-2 mainly attack the lungs first and probably again, to a small degree, some body organs that identify ACE2, such as a retrointanttal and kidneys.
Nevertheless, irregular working habits and breathing failure are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is essential to the treatment of symptoms and to the survival of health and include general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, air ventilation, and air conditioning, as well as air installations using biodegradable equipment.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be based on the use of extraroprorporial metmbrane oxygen therapy (ECMO), an improved method of cardiopulmonary used to treat a life - threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the storage of an electrolyte license, the prevention and treatment of second additions and septic shock, and the prevention of vital organs are also important for SARS-CV-2 patients.
It is known that Cytokine storms are the result of excessive reactions of antibodies to SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine is a response to a flashing program with aspects of the release of a cytokin series that includes TNF, IL 1:2, IL-6, IL-6, FNRI, FNRI, FN, FN, FN, and MCP1.
These cytokines encourage the immune system to release a large number of free medical facilities that are the primary cause of RDS and the failure of most organs.
The stress of the immune system is essential to the treatment of cytokin storms, especially for serious patients.
Crticosteroids and toyilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclons, have been used to treat the cytokines.
Another treatment for the stress of the cytokin hurricane involves the control of the immune system directed in the T cell; the stop of IFN-com, IL1, and TNF; the pronunciation of JAK; the cry of the JAKK; llinamusab; the pressure of the use of a cytokine gear 4; and HDACs.
steroids, such as amumunsuppressant, are widely used for SARS therapy to reduce the risk of outbreak.
However, steroids in high levels have not benefited from serious lung damage for SARS patients and COVID-19.
Rather, it may cause serious side effects, especially vascular osteonecrosis, which dramatically interferes with prognosis.
Nevertheless, a short system of corticosteroids in lower levels to middle levels has been recommended for careful use of COVID-19 patients who are seriously ill.
At the time of writing, no effective treatment against infection had been confirmed.
However, remedessivir, nucleotide an log, was found to be effective in an American patient with a COVID-19.
The Remdesiver is a new antibiotic that was first developed by Gilead to treat Ebola and Marlburg infections.
Later, the remessiver also indicated that it could prevent the RNA bacteria with a single layer of bacteria that include meRS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has provided China as an element to carry out research on people with SARS-CV-2, and the results are highly regarded.
In addition, baritilinib, interferon-comer,lopinavir/ritonavir, and rubibin have been raised as possible treatment for patients with critical breathing symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious reactions may occur after treatment combines with reponevir/ritonavir.
The combination of these treatments and other drugs used in patients should be observed carefully.
Plasma from physiotherapists and the development of immune
The collection of blood for recovering patients to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting disease rather than longer history.
In fact, recovering patients often have high levels of antibodies that fight the disease in their blood.
The immune system is immune globulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight disease and other nonbody factors and is able to identify different cells from disease and make them less effective directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected in the blood of a group of patients who were recovering from COVID-19 and was transmitted to 10 patients in an emergency manner.
Their symptoms were better in 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and infection levels and increased oxygen levels in the blood.
However, confirmation and clarification are needed to make a suggestion that the method is widely used before any treatment is improved.
In addition, in view of the side effects of treatment, some side effects associated with plasma should be considered seriously.
The immune system, for example, can extremely promote the reactions of the immune system and cause Cytokin disease, which may be life - threatening risk.
The amount of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma is great if patients are not treated in a critical manner.
It is difficult to build and produce certain antibodies too quickly to attack a global epidemic.
As a result, it is very important and reasonable to distinguish the B cells from the recovered patients and to be marked by genetic codes containing active genes or by the immune system which is used to represent the important proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the combination of many parts in various forms to the diagnosis based on the TCM theory.
Most of the working parts remain ignorant or vague as difficult to absorb and confirm such parts or combinations that work best.
In the meantime, because of a lack of effective and accurate treatment of COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major treatments for patients with minor symptoms to the middle of those who recover from critical classes.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du pills and the lian Hua Qing Wen pills have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
High rates of treatment for COVID-19 were noted in many Chinese states who used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei district, using TCM, about 30% of its OVID-19 patients, had a lower rate of recovery (13%).
This is an inaccurate comparison, however, as other factors of factors like the number and importance of patients should be included in a review.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study of comparing West drug treatment (WM) alone with a combination of WM and TCM.
They found that the times needed for the body’s temperature to recover, the symptoms, and hospitalization were short on the WM+TCM group with only a WM group.
More interesting, that the level of symptoms (from small to serious) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than only a WM group (7.4% compared with 64.2%) and death was lower in the WM+TCM group than only a WM (8.8% compared with 39%).
Nevertheless, the function and safety of TCM still awaits well - managed research in many major and centers.
It may also be interesting to note that the procedure is marked and that it is made clear that active parts of TCM treatment or combinations are available.
Patients with suspects or confirmed that they are infected with COVID-19 often have a greater fear of a highly contagious and deadly disease, and people who have shut themselves up again, become lonely, as well as hostile.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and serious side effects of sleep - related sleep therapy may lead to increased anxiety and psychological stress.
In the first phase of the SARS explosion, many mental - related diseases that include chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, nervous disorders, attention signals, psychiatric disorders, and even suicidal tendencies are reported.
A series of rigid and interpersonal connections, as part of public health response to the outbreak of COVID-19, may cause many people to become anxious and guilty about the consequences of joint interaction, closing, and burial in the family and friends.
As a result, mental health care should be given to the COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having it, people in contact with them, and the general public.
Psychostion should include the development of mental health centers for many areas, a clear, regular and accurate communication with regard to SARS-CV-2 revolutions and treatment programs as well as the use of electrical - therapy supplements and programs to avoid close contact with others.
Practical goals are essential in order to break free of the chain of contact between animals and predators that may be exposed and are often in line with the treatment of antibiotic - resistant strains of new microbes.
Efforts have been made to achieve goals based on S-projects to create longer and more deadly antibodies and/or prevent loss of SARS-CV.
Limited hunting goals have been studied in animals regarding SAS.
However, these biological functions are intended for adults as well as for the endangered models and their protection against infection from animals and humans will still be discovered before medical research begins.
This is because SARS has remained silent 17 years ago and no new illness has been reported since then.
On the other hand, the rare conditions and groups of MERS continue to rise from the Middle East and spread in other areas as a result of the persistence of biological sources from animals to humans in sick areas.
IRS vaccines have been developed for use by means of non-invasive virus, DNA plasma, bugs, nanoparticles, microorganisms, microorganisms, and subdivision units and others have been tested in animal models.
The building of a safety and practical goal against SARS-CV-2 in the participants is an urgent and vital task in controlling an ongoing epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to withstand the difficulties due to the long period (an average of 18 months) required for the development of the goal and the changing types of CVs.
Like a new disease, COVID-19 has just started to show its full medical program for thousands of patients.
In many cases, patients are able to recover slowly without the consequences of a previous disease.
However, like SAS and MERS, COVID-19 is again associated with a higher risk of illness and death for serious patients.
Therefore, designing a model for the cause of the disease is essential to health care services so that their missions are originally put in place, especially in areas with small help.
Based on medical research that has been reported so far, the following factors may affect or be linked to the cause of COVID - 19 patients (The Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS, which is also true of COVID-19.
COVID-19 appeared primarily in the age of 30-65 and 47.7% of those patients were more than 50 in the survey of 8,86 as described above.
Patients in need of care for serious conditions had a higher chance of being infected with other diseases and complex and being more advanced than those without them (66 age compared to 51), which suggests that age is a contributing factor in the effects of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CV-2 has been treating more men than women (001/100,000 compared with 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Already existing and complex diseases: COVID - 19 patients who need serious care have a high chance of treating serious heart damage and arthythmia.
Heart - to - heart events were also a major cause of the death of SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CV-2 can also adhere to ACE2-Post-Classyte mail, which may lead to liver failure for COVID-19 patients.
It is good to note that age as well as already existing disease is linked to strength and may be disturbing.
The effects of an unusual laboratory: The level of C-reacticive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates an increased risk of inflammation or muscle damage and has been raised to be a potential cause of disease, response to treatment, and complete recovery.
There is also a connection between the CRP level and the emergency caused by COVID-19.
In addition, high lacte dehydrogenese (LDH), asparte aminotransphere (AP), Alanine aminosphere (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely displayed in most organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during muscle damage.
As a result, they are normal signs of heart failure or liver failure.
Signs of major treatment: chest radioography and temporary progression of medical symptoms should be considered along with other forecasts of the consequences and the complexity of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As described above, immunosuppressant steroids are often used as a treatment for a combination of infectious diseases in order to reduce the risk of outbreak.
Since high levels of corticosteroids are applied to patients with critical SARS, the majority of survivors were infected with vascular osteonecrosis with a life disorder and an unhealthy quality of life.
As a result, if necessary, steroids should be used less and less time for COVID-19 patients.
Mental depression: As described above, during the outbreak of COVID - 19 many patients suffered severe depression as they had to endure long periods of silence and great uncertainty and see the death of close family members as well as their fellow patients.
It is vital that mental counsel and long - term support be given to help patients recover from stress and regain normal health.
In accordance with human knowledge research until now, COVID-19 seems to have different kinds of epidemiological features in SARS.
In addition to repeated in the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CV-2 is able to increase easily in the upper respiratory tract and cause little or no symptoms in the first stage of contact, much the same as the CVs that cause normal colds.
Therefore, patients connected to the first grade or period of treatment can produce a large number of infection during everyday activities, causing great difficulty in controlling an epidemic.
However, the combination of SARS-CV was thought to occur when patients were very sick, while most infections did not occur in the first grade.
As a result, the outbreak of COVID-19 is more critical and difficult to control than the SARS outbreaks.
There are many current efforts in China that include the Wuhan ban on the surrounding cities and the continuing closing of the entire population in hopes of hindering the transmission of SARS-CV-2.
While these measures have been extremely damaging to the economy and other parts of the world, the number of new patients is dwindling, indicating a reduction in the speed of the epidemic.
The most promising estimate is that the movement will end in March and the slowing stage will continue for 3-4 months.
Some experts, however, have lost that prospect.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which seems more compatible than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the effect of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CV-2 may hold two thirds of the world population.
The Canadian team reported that SARS-CV-2 were found in both the mid-tubrbinate and the neck of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly discovered virus may be a recombinant chapter similar to the fluster.
However, promising signs appear in China on the basis of the declining number of sick young people, which indicates that the current strategy may be effective.
At first it was predicted that Ebola would take over a million people and that half a million people would die.
However, because of severe restraint and isolation, the disease is eventually controlled.
It may be, as with SARS-CV-2, that the SARS-CV-2 may become weak and may eventually become inactive or become a less active virus.
A comparison of the OVID - 19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Death.55).
The SARS-CV-2 interact most with coughing or sneezeing, and it may be by direct contact with infected substances.
The virus was also recovered from the urine, giving a new opportunity to pass from the egg to the mouth.
A recent study of 38 patients reported that 41% of patients may have been admitted to hospitals, including 17 patients already infected with other diseases and 40 health - care workers.
Hence, greater caution should be exercised in order to protect people, especially health - care professionals, health - care workers, family members, workmates, and even people who are close to patients or individuals who are close to them.
The first line of defense that may be used to reduce the risk of infection is to put on your face masks; both the use of surgical masks and the N95 respior (a series # 1860s) helps control the spread of bacteria.
Facial masks block the blood vessels from a person who may have suspected that he is not walking in the spirit and clings to the face of things, where he can be transferred to other people.
However, only N95 measureds (a series #1860s) can protect you from breathing small turkeys from 10 to 80 n, while only 5% of the affectedions are able to pass completely; SARS-CV-2 have the same size as SARS-CV in both about 85 n.
As the cells are able to pass through the five combined operations, direct medical surgeons and patients must wear N95 masks (a series # 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, health - care workers should wear appropriate protective glasses to reduce contact with bacteria.
Bacteria can invade a person’s eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor joined SARS-CV-2 though she was wearing N95 mask; the virus may have entered her body by entering her eyes and woke up.
As a result, health - care professionals should also wear face - to - face masks or glasses while working with patients.
In normal communities in areas that are affected or that may be affected, it is highly recommended that everyone wash his hands with soap more often than usual, try to stay in the house to keep quiet and to get in touch with people who may be involved.
A distance of three steps is considered to be the right distance from patients.
These steps are practical ways to reduce the risk of infection and to prevent the spread of infection.
Although SARS-CV-2 arrived as a new virus in the world, its presence with the SARS-CV as reported on January 7, 2020 should have been a warning in China because it still remembered the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, until 19 January 2020, the director of the Center of Disease Control in Wuhan assures citizens that the new virus has little in common and has little regenerative effect when it goes from one person to another and that it is not a problem to prevent and control disease.
This message made the public suspicious, especially when the whole country was preparing for Spring Festival, and they missed a critical time to control the virus while it was still in Wuhan.
Chinese vaccines may learn from this crucial lesson and make important future progress.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more conscientious when they make public declarations as each word is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) feel and respond more to information received from a clinic rather than expect informed reports from doctors or officials; (3) stop them to control what might be during the first grade instead of trying to comfort the public; and (4) do more often to promote public opinion about the disease and research and development of the public health services at certain times.
COVID-19 caused by a new SARS-CV-2 by the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is much like SARS-COV and symptoms are also the same between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 created the feeling that SARS is repeated.
There is, however, a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is essential for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects more old people than the latest and more male than women, and the risk of death is also higher in the adult population than in the young.
SARS has a mortality rate higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared with 1.44%).
COVID - 19 patients pass the virus even when they have no symptoms while SARS patients pass it when they get too sick, which causes a greater problem in controlling COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why the SARS-CV-2 is more rapidly and widely expanded than SARS-CV.
A normal RNA of SARS-CV-2 may be contaminated in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who are treated may also experience fluency when screening.
This discovery greatly increases the risk of the spread of the virus.
Since there is a rapid progress in the study of COVID-19, a few serious problems remain to be resolved, including:
From where does SARS-CV-2 come?
Although there are 96% of the gene structure between SARS-CV-2 and two CVs like SAS, we cannot conclude that SARS-CV-2 is from bats.
Which animal was in the center of the area that transmitted the virus from the first galaxy, say bats, to humans?
If we don't know the answers to#1 and 2, we cannot successfully terminate the transfer, and the movement may be worse at any time.
While cell models and biochistic analysis have shown that SARS-CV-2 adhere to ACE2, how does the virus actually enter the respiratory cells and cause changes that cause the resulting disease?
Is the virus also attached to cells that show ACE2 in other parts of the body?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible for us to come up with a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the plague continue?
How do the genes of the virus change during human interaction?
Will it be a global epidemic, will it end as SARS or will it become worse from time to time as a cold?
It is important, but it may take some time to ponder the answers to the above questions as well as many other questions.
Regardless of how much cost, however, we have no choice but to prevent the epidemic as quickly as possible and to restore our health to normal.
The origin of an animal virus to human coronavirus
The change and flexibility have encouraged coronavirus (CVs) and its organization, which includes people, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two CVs (HCVs) were known as the cause of minor illnesses, such as common colds.
The outbreak of aero respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has changed the situation to show how much damage HCV can cause and pose a greater threat to life.
The appearance of SARS-CV-2 in China in the mid-2019 once again placed the COVs in the theater and surprised us with higher efficiency but with reduced probability compared with her SARS-CV sister.
HCV is azoonosis, and understanding the origins of HCV will help us.
Most HCVs come from bats and do not cause disease.
The middle members of some HCVs are also known.
Tattooing animal pets has positive effects on the prevention of human diseases.
Research on the relationship between the CV organization to animals may reveal important insights about the development of CV in humans.
In this review, he presented a summary of the already existing knowledge concerning seven HCVs, and we will focus on the history of their discovery and their origin of the zoonotics as well as the interactions of various species.
More important, we compare and divide various HCVs in the view of the mutation and genetic engineering.
The current PV epidemic of 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for the changes of the dollar successfully as well as the effects of the virus’s alteration to the severity of the disease are also emphasized.
Coronavirus (CVs) are part of the Coronavidie family, which consists of a close, infected group of bacteria, which has one of the RNA.
These bacteria contain the largest 60 to 32 pounds [32 kg] of the RNA bacteria that are called "CV" because of their morphology that looks like a crown under the electron microscope.
According to the building, the CVs have non-genetic components of the same order.
About three parts of the root consist of two large multi-compliance frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), translated into replicas polyprotein polyprotein and p1abs.
Polyproteins are further modified to form 16 additional proteins without a structure, called ansp1 ~/16.
The remainder of the geometry contains ORS of the building, including spike (S), envelope (E), metmbrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
The number of protrusions related to the list also has a list of various CV lists.
Based on variety of protein sequences, CVs are fitted in four stages (alpha-CV, beta-CV, gamma-Cov and Delta-CV), where the beta-CV area contains most HCVs and is divided into four columns (A, B, C and D).
The evidence of phylogenetic has shown that bats and mice are the source of Alpha-CV genes and beta-CVs, while birds are a source of gamma-COVs and delta-CVs.
For thousands of years, Covs has continued to cross the boundaries of nature, and most of them have become vitally important teachings to humans.
So far, seven CVs (HCVs) are known.
Between them HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are Alpha-CV.
The other five adapters include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, the set of respiration syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CV), the Middle East respiratory unit coronavirus (MERS-CV) and SARS-CV-2.
HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually produce small symptoms, such as normal fever and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-COV, MERS-CV and recently SARS-CV-2 are being identified, creating a serious respiratory - respiratory disorder in a large number of patients that contributes to a higher chance of developing a respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) and other diseases that occur outside the lungs.
The first version of HCV-229E, Bright14, was distinguished from the lungs of common cold patients in the mid 1960s.
Since then, more information has been obtained on the detailed HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, both of which causes birth signals.
In fact, it was accepted that HCV treatment was generally safe until SARS outbreaks.
The explosion of SARS in 2003 is one of the most tragic events in modern history, causing more than 8,000 cases of illness and about 10% of deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with occasional eruptions in other parts of the world.
The new HCV (2019-nCov), later named SARS-CV-2, is the cause of the ongoing outbreak of the colonic disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which kills more than 3,120 people and infects more than 91,000 on March 3,20.
The alarm has been crying and the world should be ready for the coming SARS-CV-2 epidemic.
All seven HCVs have a ionotic origin from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Much evidence supports the origin of all HCVs from bats, where bacteria properly adapt to the situation and do not cause disease but show a wide range of genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has set up major medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the world.
A sequence of HCV's origins provides a framework for understanding natural history, force, and elasticity factors of the flight of creatures.
This can also guide or help in considering the cause, which is central to the production of the SARS-CV-2 (intrictions) animal (intrictions), which will have important side effects in future transmission prevention.
In this restoration we draw a summary of the origin of zoonotics, interconnected organisms and HCV perthogenesis.
Especially, we highlight and discuss the same phenomenon that the parent viruses of the HCV usually cause sickness not to their natural organization but that they cause sickness after a combination of different creatures with a new galaxy.
It also replaces the credit for HCV conversions when an increase in friction usually comes and the decline of the ethogenicity.
The effects of continuing SARS-CV-2 are discussed in this context.
Animal COVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first division of HCOV-229E type, B814 from the nose of patients who had contracted common cold, various CVs were separated from endangered animals of every kind, including galif, mouse, cow, pigs, cat and dog.
Over the past decades, seven HCVs have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of HCV discoveries in sequence (The Table 1) may benefit and teach.
The first version of HCV-229E was separated from the respiratory respiratory system for patients with high respiratory infections in the year 1986, and was accepted to develop in the synapses of WI-38.
HCV-229E patients had symptoms of normal fever, including headaches, nausea, malaria, and pain throat, and fever and cough were seen in 10,0020% cases.
Later in 1967, the HCV-OC43 separated from the muscle unit and the movement of the next series in the brains of nursing rats.
Types of HCV-OC43 seem to be the same as those caused by HCV-229E, which were not necessarily distinguished from other respiratory infections such as respiratory infections A and rhnoviruses.
Both HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 are spread around the globe, and it is often connected during the winter season in good weather.
Usually, the two infections are less than a week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy HCV-229E people are exposed to mild mild flu.
Only a few patients with a depressed immune system showed serious respiratory trouble.
SARS, also known as the "synmonia", became the first plague of HCV recorded in human history and is the cause of SARS-CV, the third discovery HCV.
The first illness caused by SARS can be followed by the end of 2002 in China's Guangong Province.
The SARS epidemic led to a report of 8,096 sick people and 774 dead, scattered in many countries and continents.
Apart from the main infectiouss, it was estimated that each event could cause about two other events, during the opening period of 4 to 7 days and the rise of the infection in the 10th day of illness.
Patients connected with SARS-CV at first seemed to be suffering from maalgia, headaches, fever, malaria and cold, followed by dyspnea, coughing and breathing pressure as symptoms.
Almphopania, abnormal liver tests, and high creatine creatane are among the rarest of normal viruses due to SARS.
The spread of analolar damage, the explosion of the epitheal cell and the rise of macrophages are marked in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients need emergency care and air ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many body organs that include a retractanttal, liver, and kidneys can also be linked to these critical conditions, which are often associated with the cytokine storm, which may kill especially patients with the immune system.
The virus was first separated from open lung surgery by a relative of the first patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made in connection with HCV research.
The HCV-NL63 was separated from a seven - month - old Dutch child by the end of 2004.
It was first found to be on the rise in young children, older people, and those with antibodies that had been exposed to respiratory infections.
The discovery of coryza, conjanctitis, fever, and bronchiliitis is a common cause of HCV-NL63.
One independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a eight - month - old spinal meningitis boy in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it is actually spread around the world.
It has been estimated that HCV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of normal respiratory infections, and its high risk occurred early in summer, spring and winter.
HCV-NL63 is associated with ecstasy laryngitis, also known as a macro.
In the same year, HCV-HKU1 was distinguished from a 71 - year - old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and broncholitis in Hong Kong.
Apart from social engineering and bronchiotis, HCV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acumatic acidation.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 were found worldwide, causing low respiratory infections.
All these available HCVs are well adapted to people and often have little chance of changing into very ophrogenic diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons as in the unusual form of the highly lethal HCV-NL63 type, reportedly cause serious respiratory infections in China.
Often, when these HCVs acquire the skills to easily enter and maintain them in an ongoing state of human beings, they also kill or slightly peripheric.
The MERS-CV was first separated in 2012 from a 60 - year - old patient’s lung with critical pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the conditions guaranteed are from the Middle East, the conditions in the entry are spreading to nearby victims reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another second explosion took place in South Korea in 2015 with 186 conditions confirmed.
The appearance of MERS treatment is similar to that of SARS, which is marked by a rapid-surgery.
Unlike SAS, many MERS patients suffer serious kidney failure, which is at present different from MERS among HCV diseases.
More than 30% of patients have autotrintal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Since February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 reported cases with high mortality rates at 34.4%, making MERS-CV one of the most dangerous microbes to humans.
From mid-December 2019 to its end, many patients with pneumonia known as linked to SARS-CV-2 syndrome were found at Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization called the outbreak of lower respiratory respiratory infections caused by SARS-CV-2 as a Public Health Emergency to Concern the World and named it COVID-19.
On March 3, 2020, there were reported 90,553 patients in the world, with 3.4% of deaths.
Significantly, the number of deaths in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while one out of it is 1.2%.
SARS-CV-2 causes serious respiratory infections such as SARS-CV and MERS-CV, which have been introduced as fever, coughs and dyspnea.
Patients also suffer from diarrhea.
The pneumonia is one of the most crucial symptoms and can progress rapidly to acutate respitory stress syndrome.
Although SARS-CV and SARS-CV-2 are very similar because of the same high percentage of nucleotide sequences of 82%, there are different groups in the branches of the phylogenenetic tree.
SARS-CV-2 appear a pathogenic little but much more similar to SARS-CV and MERS-CV.
It is reported that there are people who have no symptoms with SARS-CV-2 and may be responsible for its rapid worldwide increase.
Comparing and dividing SARS-CV-2 with the other six HCVs produces a very interesting similarity.
First of all, the period of diagnosis and length of the process of HCV is very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CV-2 follows the normal rent of six other HCVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 signals is between SARS-CV and four HCVs obtained in the community (that is, HCV-299E, HC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CV-2 shows the characteristics often seen during the absence of HCVs found in the community, which include a lack of clear symptoms, minor symptoms or lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, the lower set of the emergency situations of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the condition of SARS-CV, though the average is slightly lower.
Third, the combination of SARS-CV-2 has also shown interesting points with its characteristic features of both the public HCV and SARS-CV.
On the other hand, the transfer of SARS-CV-2 is as high as that of HCV received in the community.
On the other hand, it will still be determined whether the passing of SARS-CV-2 is slowing to people as in the state of SARS-CV and MERS-CV.
Finally, like other HCVs, SARS-CV-2 can be obtained from samples in the wild.
Whether the SARS-CV-2 oral transmission plays an important role when it comes to SARS-CV under certain conditions will still be explained by future research.
It is also of great interest to see whether SARS-CV-2 will show its appearance in certain seasons as with HCVs.
Nevertheless, the aspects of SARS-CV-2 which involve its involvement, probability and maintenance increase after passing on to the people will have an impact on the final outcome of the movement of the COVID-19.
All HCVs discovered in the community are responsible for little signs that are well - suited to the public.
According to one view, it may also be true that people are well compatible with these four HCVs.
In other words, both may have survived the old HCV epidemic.
HCVs cause serious illnesses in humans, and people who suffer from acute HCV do not exist.
To this end, HCVs must go back to the population to the extent necessary to allow for the growth of changes that conform to conditions that are opposed to the factors of the sterility.
In this way, if the SARS-CV-2 explosions persist and join the majority of people, there will be a great chance that they will become more cooperative.
If they are perfectly compatible, their intervention may be difficult to prevent by closing or other means of controlling friction.
For many years, four CVs have been found in society around the human community, which causes common colds to people who have the right response to the immune system.
These germs do not need an animal’s source.
In contrast, the SARS-CV and the Paphrogenic MORS-CV are not fully compatible with the people and their interaction between the people is unable to be preserved.
They need to keep themselves in shape and grow in their biological source and want the opportunity to pass on to the victims who may be exposed, likely by one or more middle aid and raise the innocent.
SARS-CV-2 have the same characteristics as both SARS-CV/MERS-COV and four HCVs received in the community.
It runs as much as the HCVs found in the community, at least in the first form.
However, Pathogenic is much more than HCVs obtained in the community and has less ophthogenic in SARS-CV or MERS-CV.
It is still to be seen whether it will be perfectly compatible with humans and move around without the source or the central animal resources.
Before discussing the origin of HCV animals, it will help us to discuss the meaning and characteristics of variables, naturalists, sources, middle and magnifying HCVs.
An animal becomes a substitute for HCOV if it holds a closely related ancestor with a high degree of nucleotide sequence.
The original virus is usually highly compatible and does not cause the virus.
Similarly, the source resources sustain HCV continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, abusers are naturally involved and are natural HCV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCV is moved again to the middle or middle of the population, it is not well compatible with the new compass and often causes disease.
The central investigator may be a biological resource for human involvement and play a role in fostering the virus to respiration and transfer it to humans to increase population levels.
HCV can cope with a final intervention if it can preserve its internal involvement.
On the contrary, HCVs are able to adapt to the middle gas and even develop long - term chemical processes.
In this setting, the middle team becomes a natural resource.
An epidemiological data showed that back in view of the presence of the SARS signal patient had a history of contact with hunted animals.
The subsequent studies of farmers showed that the IgG had an anti-SARS-CV number compared with the number of ordinary people.
Masked logem civet (pakaka varvata) and caroon dog in living markets have been found to carry viruses similar to SARS-CVs that are close to SARS-CV.
This was directly supported by the fact that no more SARS reported after the murder of all Civets in the market.
However, it has been reported that the wild masked palm civets or the unrecognizable farms of the animal industry were once unsupervised when it comes to SARS-CV, suggesting that tasked packs may be a middle - growing industry but not a natural source of SARS-CV.
It is noteworthy, that 80% of the various Guangzhous have a immune system against SARS-CV, we cannot ignore the possibility that many mammals are the growing tourists of the SARS-CV.
All of these appear to be the last SARS-CV observers.
A subsequent study of the SARS-CV natural animal creation produced a COV closely related to the bats, called SARS-related Rhirnolopas BaV HKU3 (SARSR-R-BatCOV HKU3), which is found in a sign called Chinese horse helmet.
These bats are silent when it comes to the immune system against SARS-CV and the SARSr-Rh-BatV HKK3.
This and other bat-compliant Clusters calculated by 88-92% of nucleotide sequences and SARS-CV.
These studies have led to the development of a new theory that bats could attract new human species.
CVs like SARS (SL-CVs) are marked on bats, but none other than those called WV1 are able to be classified as a living virus.
The people are known as SARS-CV server.
The WV1 adopted from the bat dung sample was shown to use a bat, civet and ACE2 people as an internal to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the radiation of the SARS patients was capable of killing WV1.
So far, Wiv1 represents the closely related ancestor SARS-CV in the bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence.
Although there is a high degree of oxygen between these two bacteria, it is generally believed that WEV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CV and the bats that had a nearby SARS-CV host.
Xylogenetic analysis includes MERS-CV with the same group as the COV-HKU4 bug and the COV-HKU5 bat.
The CV-HKU4 of the bat and the MERS-CV use the same team's assigned host, tapedyyl perptidase 4 (DP4), in the entry of the virus.
The sequence of RNA-CV RNA-posal-MERS-COV-popularly is close to their beta-Cov-cov-batals discovered in Europe and Africa.
So far, there is no living MERS-COV available from wild bats.
The MERS-COV and its nearby COV-HKU25 bat-subjection relatives shared only by 87% of the nucleotide biology process.
As a result, bats may not be a nearby source of MERS-CV.
On the other hand, surveys in the Middle East have shown that the camels of theeropolity are in the immune system directly killing MERS-CV, like camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
A Living MERS-COV-like virus found in humans was distinguished from the camel’s engine engine, which further shows that camels are a real source of MERS-CV.
It is also noteworthy that there were often minor symptoms but a major release of the MERS-CVs by research.
Significantly, not only by breathing force but also by oral respiration, which is also the primary route to infection from bats.
However, questions remain, since many MERS do not have a record of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, the interaction from one person to another or unknown link systems involving unknown animals occupying the MERS-CV.
SARS-COV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide's CV RaTG13 bats divided from the Rhinolopus afifinis.
As with SARS-CV and MERS-CV, the variety of sequences between SARS-CV-2 and RATG13 are very large that a parent relationship can be shared.
That means, the bats may have had a nearby source of SARS-CV-2 except when a similar boab is found in the future.
According to one estimate, SARS-CV-2 gamekeepers should be among the wild animals sold and killed at the Huanaan Seaod Wheelsale Market, most of which were associated with the first illness of COVID-19, which indicates that there may have been an event of contact from animals to humans.
A few recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of small mammals known as pangolins (Manois javanica) may be harboring older beta-CV related to SARS-CV-2.
These new gengolin CoV shared by 85-92% of the urcleotide sequences and SARS-CV-2.
However, they are related equally close to RATG13 with about 90% of the sequence of Nucleotide.
They come together as two subspecies similar to SARS-CV-2 in the physics tree, one of them sharing the background of the most similar territory (RBD) with SARS-CV-2, and a combination of amino acid's sequence of 97.4%.
In sharp contrast, SARS-CV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although there is a high degree of genome's overall sequence of biology.
A previous study of sick pangolins reported the discovery of infected gonigs in lung samples, which appear to be related to SARS-CV-2.
The study used various methods of construction and manual design to form a sequence of a part of the approximately 86.3% of the total length of the virus’s genome.
We are not able to set aside the chance that the pangolin is one of the nearby SARS-CV-2 animals.
At present, however, there is no evidence to support the fact that the pangolin is a direct source of SARS-CV-2 due to the differences between SARS-CV-2 and SARS-COV-2 of the congolin related beta-COVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CV-2 and RATG13 is much shorter between SARS-CV-2 and SARS-CV-2 of secondary-bat-COV-2.
SARS-CV-2 from bats, pangolinins and other mammals will yet be discovered.
Although high-level RBDs are found between SARS-CV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CV-2 related to beta-CV, SARS-CV-2 and RaTG13 share high voltimology of the broad climate.
There are high criticisms that the high level of contact between RBS-CV-2 devices related to beta-CV and SARS-CV-2 is being conducted by exchange contacts.
One suggestion recommends the recombination between SARS-CV-2 of the secondary-congiliary related to beta-CV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal.
As with the power of conversion, recombination is spread among the beta-CVs.
The conclusion is not yet achieved regarding the origin of the nearby SARS-CV-2.
Apart from the most ophthogenics, the origin of HCV-229E zoonatic, HC43, HCV-NL63 and HCKU1 are also investigated.
Evidence of phylogenetic has shown that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E may have started in the rubies, while the parent bacteria of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 are found in rats.
It is reported that the ARCV.2 APlachian RidgeCV (Apparachian CoV) found in a three - color North America bat indicated a relationship close to HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E was related to the genetic code of the WAV, called Himpoderos/Gana Kwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while camerids have been accused of its immediate organization.
To clarify it, the current knowledge about the origin of known HCOV animals has been reached in Picture 1 and Tabula 2.
Xylogenic analysis has given evidence of the interactions of HCV creatures in history.
When the HCV-OC43 was moved from another animal to man from farm animals about 1890, a respiratory plague was recorded.
The history of the interconnection of various HCV-229E creatures is not so clear.
There have been a discovery of anti-c wasn't equal to HCV-229E.
Among them are the alpha-CV.
A few evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First of all, people not the alpacas may be in contact with bats in the same environment.
Instead, people draw close to the alpacas.
Second, alpha-CVs are associated with various HCV-229Es and does not cause infection in bats, while the alpaca-Cophalpa-CV did cause respiratory infections.
Finally, alpha-CV of the Orpah has not yet been found in wild animals.
As a result, we would not ignore the possibility that thephacas obtained anal-COV associated with HCV-229E to people.
In fact, bats are a direct source of bacteria that cause people to become ills that include the virus of rabbis, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats may be able to transmit HCV-229 to humans directly.
On the other hand, when the alpha-Cov bats serve as a group of HCV-229E genes, pacas and hydrometry camels may be the central transmitter of the virus to humans, as is MERS-CV.
The MERS-CV is a good example of the link between different creatures from bats to hydrometry camels to humans.
The origin of MERS-CV evolution from bats is known in its initial introduction and strengthened by the subsequent discovery.
Evidently, bats give different kinds of bacteria a chance to exchange genetic elements between different animals and intersects.
Long life, crowded colonies, close public relations and powerful flight skills are all ideal conditions for bats to become a good agent of the virus.
On the other hand, the MERS-Cov has been introduced to hydromedary cameras for hundreds of years.
It is well adapted to these camels who turn to the middle layer to become a stable and a natural source.
MERS-CV causes little illness and has a lower rate of change in these animals.
Its joining to the people is a mistake and people remain the last MERS-COV client since its transfer is not possible to be saved.
In contrast with the role of camels in MERS-CV delivery, the role of pongoliin, if available, in passing SARS-CV-2 is different.
In particular, the beta-CV in pangolins cause a serious illness in the pangolins.
She may be a last-Cov-beta-Cov-COV-2-like-Cov, similar to carves in the SARS-CV environment.
SARS-CV-2 from animals to humans should be considered or not in future studies.
First of all, bats may be a source of virus related to SARS-CV-2 similar to SARS-CV-2.
People may play a similar role with bats by performing operations on animals or by digging coal.
Second, the pangolins may be a growing asset in the middle where the virus related to SARS-CV-2 has recently been developed.
People are infected with the disease through surgery and eating the meat of the hunt.
Most mammals including domestic animals may be exposed to SARS-CV-2.
A study of pets and wildlife conservation studies is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and re-conservation of SARS-CV-2 is likely to occur in the third creature associated with both bats and pangolins.
The analysis of the SARS-CV-2 animal continues.
In addition to the various kinds of animalists, there are three main elements on the side of the virus that are important in making COVs across the border of creatures.
First of all, their high number of changes in RNA replacements.
Compared with other RNA bacteria that have a single color, the amount of CV changes may be viewed as "little" to "higher" depending on the change rate of 010-4 per year at each point 2, depending on the level of the CV in new entertainers.
CEVs have the xoribonnucles to search for errors, the removal of them results in extreme changes and loss of energy or the inability to develop properly.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analge Remdesir is known to suppress the frequency of COV by the blocking of this mollolese and the RNA polymerase dependent on the RNA.
The Remsesir is one of the most promising parties against SARS-CV-2 to be studied in medical research.
Nevertheless, the figures for the change of the CVs are about a million times higher than those.
In addition, the number of changes is usually high when the COVs are properly in harmony with the client.
Compared with SARS-CV with a high rate of change, the number of changes of SARS-CV-2 is seen as low, suggesting a higher level of human tolerance.
It is thought that it may already have been accepted by another human - friendly organization.
In addition to SARS-CV-2, this applies again to MERS-CV, which is in good harmony with the camel camels.
It is thought that it is unlikely that genetic changes could cause the goals and antibiotics against SARS-CV-2 if they are not effective immediately.
Second, a large RNA interface to the COV uses more flexibility in the transformation of the geometry and recombination, thus increasing the opportunity of voltage of various creatures, which is beneficial to the appearance of new CVs when conditions are suitable.
This is supported by a number of different reading frames and protein functions that are produced by a 3
Third, non-local CSV change of computers during RNA repeats in a different way as "select-copy-to-do" option.
In an organization that acts as a mixer, a change of type occurs regularly during the CV RNA scan.
The most largely full length of hemologous and the subgenomics may be reunited to form new COVs.
Physic evidence for genetic engineering has been found in both HCV-HKU1, HC43, and animal COVs such as SL-CV for the bat and batCV-HKU9.
A virus connection with steroids in connection with inflammatory
Apart from the three components of the virus mentioned above, the cooperation of the virus and the maternal mate is another major factor that affects the interaction of different species.
Here, the reuniting of SARS-CV is considered a common example, which provided evidence of the wider selection between the events of the interconnection of different species.
Based on contrasting analysis between people separated from the SARS-CVs on Civet, it is estimated that SARS-CV deals with immediate reaction to different hosts, especially with changes in RBD for S-R-Cov unit S.
Usually, RBD in the S CV channel cooperates with the cell server and is strongly chosen for the responses of the immune system.
In SARS-CV, RBD is in 318mino acids to 510 in part of S1, which adheres to the human ACE2 and its coreceptors for infection.
The SARS-CV is able to see an ACE2 partake of different animals, including bats, civet, mouse andraccoon dog, which allows a virus contact of different species.
In fact, only 6 pieces of amino acid that have been noted to be different from the isolation of human virus and civet in RBD are 4 of them found in a motif attached to the distribution in order to deal with the ACE2 server.
The SARS-Cov-Civret has the changes of K479N and S487T on its RBD, which may increase the level of the contact for the Spike protein protein and ACE2 server.
In other words, this change of two amino acids may be essential to the transmission of the virus to humans.
It is noteworthy that the SARS-CV-2 has a similar shared share of the SARS-CV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CV-2 and SARS-CV in S-CV unit of S-S-Provis unit means that the level of contact for S and ACE2 people may have changed.
In fact, the study of cylo-EM shows a high degree of 10 to 20- of this angle, rather than between ACE2 people and S-CV-profeterate S-CV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another coreceptor is required for the SARS-CV-2 addition.
Interestingly, HCV-NL63 is again attached to ACE2 but with a different section S.
There are other HCV components, such as antipathoids N at HCV-229E, and 9-O-acetyrated calic acid acid for HCV-OC43.
They may also be viewed as a reason for the success of the success of the CVs in human society after a combination of different creatures from their animal breeders.
In addition to cellular components, the result of a combination of different forms of HCV is also controlled by dependence on another creature and the characteristics of a limit.
The differences between these rogues between humans and ophthalmists who are the natural source of HCV as bats, hydrometry camels, and rats may cause a barrier to the interaction between different creatures.
HCVs should take the characteristics of reliance on the owner and interfere with the characteristics of the ecliptics so that there will be a successful interaction of species.
In this regard, cell mates in this vital area will no longer be identified and identified.
SARS-CV-2 by using CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCV appearance: restoring
The variety of bat bats provides many opportunities for new HCVs.
In this sense, bat bat acts as a group of HCV genes.
In addition, rapid changes and genetic engineering also continue HCV conversions and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the discovery or loss of genes that make up a new protein code has the power to alter most of the bacteria.
Among helper proteins in SARS-CV, ORF8 is thought to be important in human cooperation, since the virus related to SARS-CV is divided but found producing variousORF8 proteins.
An element of 29-nucleotides of SARS-CVs has been found in different types at the beginning of a human epidemic.
This removal separates the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a self-condition which encourages the changing of the identity.
Besides, the SARS-CV may have a history of reuniting with the blood-cooked CV lists and gammama, where a large number of sub-programmes were found in the RNA polymerase based on the RNA.
Reunites were found again in ansp9, in a large portion of ans10, and in sections of ans14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-COV epidemic experienced the reuniting events between different lists, which occur in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from SARS-CV and MERS-CV, recombination events have been noted in some HCVs, where HCVs are reunited with other animals CoVs in their nonstructures.
It should also be noted that the selection may contribute to unpredictable changes in the virusgens, which may result in freeing the strains of the choice used, such as those of the body’s immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of RF4 with the full length of HCV-229E protocol, due to the removal of a double nucleotide.
Although complete RF4 is seen in bat-line bacteria associated with HCV-229E, analca-Coph-CV indicates a single dose of nucleotide, which leads to a change of frame.
Finally, but importantly, new HCV conversions are also held under pressure to be selected from its source.
There were no symptoms or only minor symptoms found when the bats were joined with the CVs, which indicate a similar connection between the COVs and the bats.
It seems that the bats are well fitted with the CVs according to the structure and operation.
For example, the interfere with the use of responses that encourage an outbreak of bats easily reduces the pathology introduced by COVs.
Besides, the function of the natural killer cell to the bats is distressed because of the rise in reactions of the chain of the natural killer cell NKG2/CD94 and the lower level of synaptic cells I complex histocomability.
In addition, the higher levels of living creatures (ROS) that are built on high - quality bats feeding may affect both the pressure of the CV replacement therapy and the testing of errors with xoribouclease, thus providing the pressure for the selecting of the most dangerous strains of bacteria when introduced to a new environment.
Highly ethogenic types may also be altered by recombination, which leads to the discovery of new protein or protein characteristics of the cooperation of the bees.
As a result, it is not just a coincidence that three new HCVs appeared two decades ago.
CVs do not become ill or cause little symptoms to their main entertainers like bats and camels.
They went back fast without encouraging strong reactions to the immune system.
Here are some secrets as to why nonmarked carriers are seen and what is behind the critical conditions in people’s illness.
Particularly serious symptoms are caused by increased immune activity and the cytokin hurricane when there is strong immune response, the damage to the lungs is greater.
In contrast, for those who do not show signs of illness, the response of the immune system has been doubled in the frequency of CV.
The same strategy for dividing the reactions of the immune system may have a beneficial effect on the treatment against SARS-CV-2.
The response of the interferon is particularly strong on the bats.
As a result, the use of I interferon I in at least the first stages of the SARS-CV-2 in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the use of NLRP3 inflammasome for bats is not valid.
According to this estimate, the NLRP3 inflammasome with MC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CV-2 follows the usual camera for SARS-CV development and MERS-CV.
Despite the findings of the Biot-CoV virus shared by 95% of the nucleotide hormone and SARS-CV, there is also a British CV shared by 96% of nucleotide hormones and SARS-CV-2.
Although civets and other market animals have been found to harbor viruses such as SARS-CV, the nearby centralists of SARS-CV-2 have not yet been found.
There have been a discovery of gengolin beta-Cov-Cov-2 such as the SARS-Cov-2, which indicates that it is possible that only some of the middle-songoslins or beta-Cov-Consoliins may be useful to parts of the genes in the latter version of SARS-CV-2.
Although the questions are still, there is no evidence that SARS-CV-2 is man-made purpose or error.
The CVs are returned to the fair due to the later outbreak of SARS-CV-2.
A study of CVs on bats and other animals has profoundly changed our view of the importance of zoonotic origins and HCV animal sources in human interactions.
The widespread evidence indicates that SARS-CV, MERS-CV, and SARS-CV-2 have a sub-programme source and is passed on to people by middle-mediators.
Since a combination of SARS-CV comes from contact between people and markets, closing the living market and killing the Cives could end the SARS epidemic.
In the same sense, the pangolins should be removed from the biological markets to prevent possible interconnection, considering the discovery of many beta-Cov-Congolin lists closely related to SARS-CV-2.
However, whether it is transmitted and how it is passed through the SARS-CV-2 people with pargolin and other mammals will still be explained at future burial sites.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been available for extended periods of time.
These camels are an important means of transport as well as a main source of meat, honey, skin, and grain products to local people.
It is not widely spread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible for all camels to be killed to control the MERS, as happens in Chinese wildlife markets to block the circulation of SARS-COV and SARS-CV-2.
To prevent the multiplication of MERS, more methods must be used to develop effective goals against the camel-Cov, accompanied by other measures to control the disease.
Since we can eliminate these bacteria, new genotypes may appear to cause outbreaks.
Various kinds of amoontics rotate in the wilderness.
In particular, very different kinds of seams have strong voltages.
There are many opportunities for these robots to change and recognis, which will result in new CVs who are more able to interact with each other and/or kill people in the future.
The custom of eating wildlife in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a better program of preparation and response.
In fact, most of the long - term bacteria in the world exist.
They stay in their natural habitat until they have the opportunity to leave.
Although bats have many characteristics that encourage the spread of germs, the opportunity for humans to communicate with bats and other wild animals can be weakened if people are taught that they are far away from them.
Continued care of mammals is necessary to better understand the covology and its natural predators, which will be useful in preventing the transmission from animals to humans as well as future outbreaks.
At the conclusion, the best way to prevent the viral ozone layer is for humans to be away from the natural sources of the ozone layer.
A few parts of the puzzle source of SARS-CV-2 is not yet found.
First, if the bats transmit the SARS-CV-2-pogolins, it will be helpful to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins are able to share the environment.
Second, if bats play a key role in human interactions, it should be determined how people communicate with bats.
Third, if a mammal acts as a true medium, the way we deal with a variety of people, bats, and pangolins should be explained.
Finally, as many mammals and pets may be exposed to SARS-CV-2, both care and research should be done.
If it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that the SARS-CV-2 or its parent bacteria will likely be found in their natural resources in the future.
Further research in this area will explain the nature of SARS-CV-2 animal evolution, with significant effects on the prevention and management of COVID-19.
A review of the matter of testing for those who are "reprojected" and "not proved" that they are under COVID-19 required.
On February 6, 2020, our team had published a quick sample of the early advice for testing and treatment of a new colonvirus interface 2019 (2019-nCV), and the program provided our experience and provided a fitting license to fight this global epidemic.
However, the 20th coronavirus (COVID-19) new disease, awareness and understanding are increasing on the basis of ongoing research and medical experience; therefore, the techniques of testing and treatment continue to be repeated.
In this book, we answered one comment about our path and gave the matter of a new survey of those who are "reproprietized" and "surely" that they are ill according to Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh class) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
By December 2019, the new caronavirus (2019-nCV) had caused outbreaks, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named sere acate respitory syndrome unit 2 (SARS-CV-2).
In 11 March 2020, WHO referred to the COVID-19 as a epidemic.
For the exception of the SARS-Cov-2, our team has developed a quick response rate and is printed on the Internet on the Military Medical Research in February 2020.
He received much attention since it was printed.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, awareness and knowledge about it, as a result of scientific findings and medical experience; therefore, the techniques for testing and treatment continue to be restored.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.www.ngov.c.n/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, produced seven volumes in which some items are significantly altered.
Our giraffe received notice from the Zhou et al., providing a simple suggestion of points based on their experience.
Their work adds new proof of our paleontology and makes a significant reference to this epidemic throughout the world.
We commend their vital work and express our gratitude.
Their DO, however, needs to be repaid in accordance with the recent Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Secrequent seventh research program) with recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to ensure the diagnosis, it is necessary to cleanse any one of the characteristics of the epideminological history and two operations to make a general review, or to meet three medical criteria without a definite epidimic history:
The history of epidemiological: (1) the history of visiting or staying in the town of Wuhan and the environment, or other communities in which COVID - 19 is reported 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) the history of contact with people connected with SARS-CV-2 (incovic acid tests); (3) the history of contact with diabetes patients or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan and the environment, or other communities in which COVD-19 are reported 14 days before the onset of symptoms; and (4) the history of contact with many patients who are involved with the symptoms of sleep, such as the number of symptoms, and the number of symptoms, including the number of health, which are displayed in schools.
Symptoms of treatment: (1) fever once/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) symptoms of the metaphor of COVID - 19; (3) total number of white blood cells that indicate the number of normal, low, or decreased lymphocyte levels in the first grade.
A confirmed diagnosis should be based on a proposed medical or verification of the following evidence: (1) the slow examination of the SARS-CV-2 real time observation; (2) the sequence of the total gengengeneity of the virus showing high levels in the new Coronavirus bacteria; (3) the presence of the presence of a direct IgM and the IgGIG for SAR-CV-2 standard diagnosis of the SAR; or the correct diagnosis of the IR-CR-CO-CO-CO-2 virus virus is the best option of the first term.
We see that the real period of PCR of nucleic acid in the respiratory or in blood samples is inserted into second phases (18 January 2020) and 3 (2 January 20).
Pethogenic findings in the blood samples of the four national units (27 January 2020) and five (8 February 2020); and the evidence for serological evidence is included in the seventh order.
These changes based on the continued work of researchers on the search for high nucleic acids for rapid tests, as well as respirator scans, which increased the availability of different tissue, and contributed to the overall effect of a particular immune system on the established matter.
Besides, there is additional evidence to remind us that we are on guard against patients with unusual symptoms and those who do not have symptoms.
Hence, the Zhou et al pass chart should be returned, since it refers to a person who has no symptoms of treatment, as "as at low risk."
The point process also needs to be reassured at work and in the ongoing medical courses.
In conclusion, we hope for further evidence to come and ask that the disciples observe it.
In order to make a diagnosis of "reprofessed illness" and "volved illness", we recommend that it be followed and attended by new national channels at their home.
Our shield will again turn our backs on our backs to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest number of day.
Recently, Bangladesh confirmed a new death due to COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of day - long cases caused by the virus.
Since yesterday, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) has reported that the number of sick people is 114 and 33 survivors living at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In the media, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the dead include four men as well as one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were more than 60 years, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41-50.
He also said that two of them had been from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declares that COVID-19 is a epidemic on March 11.
The hospital official told Anadola Agency, a local news source, that one of the dead was Jaal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an Internet video announcement, the public transport minister in Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport will be closed for more time than was scheduled, until this coming Saturday.
This closing of public transport had begun on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of important goods - for treatment, fuel and food - still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were March 8, for two persons who returned from Italy along with their wife.
On March 19, these three were already healed.
The number of SARS-CV-2 is more than one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of people with SARS-CV-2 coronavirus passed over a million worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University chart.
At least 52 thousand deaths were associated with COVID-19, a disorder caused by coronavirus.
This happened on the same day that Malawi confirmed her first illness caused by coronavirus and Zambia had her first death related to coronavirus.
North Korea has said, beginning on Thursday, that it is one of the few countries that have a coronavirus.
The previous day, the World Health Organization carried a determined report of 1,0,551,635 ailments, which include 79,332 hours before 10 a.m., according to Central European Europe (000 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand coronavirus cases are recorded, related to about 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reports, quoting the Johns Hopkins University data, that there are more than 1,000 deaths in the US on Wednesday due to connavirus interference.
Around the world, countries have declared firm measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyan, a city in Moscow, has held a ban on the city until May 1.
Throughout the world, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russian people would continue to be paid without their employment until April 30.

The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, has declared that the state has established its residence order until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce the price of a small house paper on each purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australia’s shopping malls Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchase of toilet paper so that one can buy two and one pack for each purchase in the whole country, in order to buy one.
ALDI also opens the end of a single pack, on Monday.
These channels are printed as messages on exit, and on the Facebook pages of the store.
The buyers have continued to buy their bulk because of fear of COVID-19 if they have to separate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths reconvenes the sale of toilet paper to those who are brought home to be a single pepper with each order.
These changes follow on the fore-and-aft of four-pounders at each purchase, presented by the Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"Coles, in its March 8, news conference reported that at the end of the set of four pears, "most stores are still empty after the hour of their delivery."", and called the need "extensive"", whereas ALDI, to its Facebook poster on Tuesday, "and "unexpected"."
"Acceleration" was very high" last week, according to the Wolworths prosecutor.
The Cestco stores in Canberra also multiply the allowed number to be two sacks a week ago.
In order to deal with searches, Coles ordered larger packages for the surgeons and announced the increase in the distribution, the Woolworths ordered an extra parcel, while ALDI made a set-up to be readily available.
Russell Zimmerman, senior director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that the merchants are trying to raise the pocket, but the divisions of the local council regarding the time of trucking make things difficult.
He expects the cost of production to rise, as surgeons try to meet the need, with a few pesos.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that as a result of the immediate release of a vaccine, some stores were unable to continue with the Wednesday detective.
In a report in News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortitimer, a Queensland University of Technology.
Mark noted that a small house paper is a heavy item, leading to a low number of loopholes in numbers, and, once completed, leaving a large opening open, which reinforces the feeling that it is worshiped.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea [that] if there were many things in the shelves, if a product such as small homemade paper and tractors might be [sold] and there is a lot, you would probably reduce fear by saying Russell Zimmerman according to ABC News.
The inventor of the recombinant locker Who Gives a Cprap said on Wednesday and then lost out.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleek Toilet Tissue, and Sorasis Parper making Sorbent, stressed that they worked 24/7 to keep the product available, according to a report in News.com.
Domain.com, home sales receipts, report that some room vendors give free paper to the first person loaded in an Action in Melbourne, where a few transactions are conducted because consumers have time to rest because of the long - term Labour Day.
A Thursday version of the NNT News, a Darwin daily printed newspaper, installed a quadruplet with pages intended to be cut and used as a secret paper.
The stores initially hesitate to set limits, according to the ABC Australia report on March 3 when they said they did not have access plans to access access levels.
Russell Zimmerman adds that some products also have a high need, including diamonds, tomatoes, dried foods, soap for cooking and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday night the British Internet supermarket sold to Ocado was seen to cover the purchase of Andes' public paper so that there would be two drawers containing 12 trucks.
The World Health Organization calls the COVID-19 pandemic
On the third day, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 — a disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CV-2 — an epidemic.
"Where the word "the epidemic" refers to the extent of the disease is affected, not to the extent in which specific examples are harmful, WHO has indicated the need to run governments in action:"
All countries are unable to reverse this pandemic.
If countries are searching, investigating, here, separating, following, and acting on human functions, says Tedros Adamo Ghebreyes, Director-Octor of WHO.
We are deeply concerned about both the alarming and difficult expansions and the lack of movement in shock.
"As for Dr. Tom Frieden, who was the previous director of the United States's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she is "intrible"."
"He said, according to the notice declared to the CNN in February, "without the flu, no other respiratory infection has been followed from there until it is spreading around the world."
"Grebreyus has given the same vision, "We've never seen before the plague wiped out the coronavirus."
"You're going on," and never before we have seen a epidemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new situation of the plague follows the decision of WHO's January's decision to call civilization a global crisis of the emergency state of public health.
"The director of the United States' National Institute of Autogy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said, "What remains, is going to be worse."
Since Thursday, the Associated Press reports that there are at least 126,000 examples of COVID-19 worldwide, leading above 4.600 dead.
The epidemic of 2019–20ronavirus is an ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease, caused by a sere respiency syndrome connavirus 2 (SARS-CV-2).
The outbreak was held in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and was added as the Global Health Emergency on January 30, 2020, and it was considered a epidemic on 11 March 2020.
Since 10 April 2020, an accurate 1,61 million examples of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries, leading to 97,000 dead.
Some 36,000 people have recovered.
The number of examples of destruction has been estimated at 4% in China, at the same time as the globe from 13.04% in Algeria to 10.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include heat, sweat, and cold.
Problems may include pneumonia and aute respiration depression.
The time of exposure to symptoms usually lasts for five days, but it can range from two to fourteen.
There is no known cure or treatment that can defeat the virus.
A major form of treatment that focuses on signs and helpful care may include hand - to - hand cleaning, closing your mouth while coughing, keeping a distance between you and others, and keeping oneself out of people who suspect that they may be affected.
The authorities around the world are now responding to restrictions on travel, separation, movement, safety precautions in the workplace, and land limits.
The plague has led to severe economic and social upheavals around the world, to slow down in sports, religion, politics, and cultural events, as well as to the lack of basic necessities that are now cut short by chance.
Schools including universities are closed the country or 193 countries, affecting 99.4 percent correctly for the majority of students worldwide.
Wrong information about the virus has become widely available on the Internet, and there have also been cases of racial prejudice and discrimination against Chinese people, other people from the East and the descendants of the Far East, and the appearance of North Asian countries, and others from the world with many examples of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel rates and the closing of large industries, there has been a reduction in pollution of air and carbon dioxide signals.
The health authorities at Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) have established a series of chemical examples unknown on 31 December 2019, and a survey was opened at the beginning of January 2020.
Many examples had been linked to the Huanaan Seaod Whole Market, so the virus is caused by the origin of the biological origin of the animal.
The outbreak virus is known as SARS-CV-2, a virus that begins to develop that is closely related to the lbanaviruses, cronaviruses of pangolin, and SARS-CV. The first known person who showed symptoms was later found to be ill in December 2019, and that the person never had a clear connection with the wet team.
In the first series of examples reported on December 2019, three parts were found connected to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an uncertain report from the South China Morning Post raised that the following example from 17 November 2019, of a 55 - year - old member of the province of Hubei, may be the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new examples are reported to be declining in China but they are growing by accident in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of examples of new examples outside China for China for the first time.
There may be reports under examples, especially among those with impaired symptoms.
By 26 February, small examples had been set among the youths, those who had sinned 19 and undertook 2.4% of the world's worldwide examples. The chief science counselor of the United Kingdom's, Patrick Ballance, gave me 60% of the British community who would need to fit in so that the ephecilization might be achieved.
The examples refer to the number of persons tested for COVID-19, and their analysis confirming the conviction in accordance with the procedure.
Since 23 March, no country has studied more than 3% of its population, and many countries had laws to avoid the testing of those who have only weak symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A survey published on 16 March found that in China, up to 23 January, the figure is 86% of COVID-19, and this unwritten link is the 75% source of recorded cases of disease.
Statistics published by March 30 measured that the number of joinings in Italy is much higher than reported examples.
The first estimate of the simple birthrate ($00) of the COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that there may be 5.7.
Most cases with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who are not healed, the time from the beginning of the signs to the death is between 6 and 41 days, which are most common to 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, at least 97,000 deaths were presented as a reason for the COVID-19.
In China, since 5 February about 80% of the dead were more than 60, and 75% already have physical health problems that include heart disease and diabetes. The official death statistics on the OVID - 19 epidemic usually refer to people who have been diagnosed as COVID.
The true number of dead may be very large, since it does not include everyone who dies without checking -ib. at home, in the home of the elders, etc.
A data from Italy found that the number of deaths during the plague exceeded the official death rates due to COVID by 4-5x.
"A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know" that the number of deaths is below the estimate"), a statement consistent with the U.S. numeral reports of accounting under the U.S.. such measurement is common if there is a epidemic, such as a H1N1-four epidemic in 2009. The first death was confirmed in Wuhan by January 2020".
The first deaths occurring outside the Chinese country itself occurred in 1 February in the Philippines, and the first deaths occurring outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On 28 February, apart from China itself, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and areas had reported death, in all continents except Antarctica. There are several steps generally used to calculate the mortality rate.
These numbers vary from place to place, and are influenced by the magnitude of diagnosis, health care behavior, treatment methods, time since outbreaks, and social factors such as age, sex, and general health. The dath-to-case rate of the dead is divided by the number of examples studied during a certain period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the Global Death-to-case ray is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) since April 2020.
The number varies from place to place.
In China, the estimate of dath-to-case roterate was down from 17.3% (for those who had symptoms appearing on November 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who had symptoms appearing in February 2020). Other measures include casesity rate (CFR), which indicates a percentage of people who died from disease, and infR (IFR), which indicates a percentage of infected (experated and undiagnosed) death.
These figures do not depend on time and follow the number of individuals from contributing to the model solution.
Many highly educated people tried to calculate the numbers of certain people.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidance-Based Medicine estimates that infestation factorrate throughout the general epidemic is between 0.01% and 0.1%.39%.
A higher estimate of this rate is in line with the results from an informal survey of COVID - 19 in Germany, and a study of statistics that evaluate the results of CFR tests.
WHO asserts that the epidemic can be controlled.
The true height and height of the awake are not sure and may vary from place to place.
"Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, "If left unchecked, the related outbreaks slow down the creation and begin to decrease when the disease is lost by the survivors."
"But it is almost impossible to make a guess now about when that will be."
"The chief Chinese medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said "May be finished by June" if all countries are able to follow the steps of WHO to prevent the spread of the virus."
"In 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygine & Tropical Medicine spoke and said SARS-CV-2 "will go around, actively for one or two years."
"According to the study of Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other steps will be required "until the solution is obtained (by bathing 18 months or more)."
"William Schaffer of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it can't be possible that this coronavirus will easily pass away from it forever" may also "become a year- round sickness" and return every year."
The returning rage will depend on the firm protection of the flock and the degree of self - change
Signs of COVID-19 may be inaccurate in some respects and people connected may have no symptoms.
The most common symptoms are heat (8%) and dry cough (68%).
The most common symptoms include fatigue, the form of saliva and flegs in the chest (plegm), loss of sense of smell, loss of breath, muscle and joint pain, pain of the throat, headaches, fever, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanis. WHO has said that 1 person in 6 is seriously ill and has a respiratory problem.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list that displays such urgent symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent pain or depression, nausea, difficulties when awakening, and cancer face or lips; early medical care is recommended if these symptoms are available. The progress in illness can lead to severe pneumonia, a vascular disorder, epticshock, and death.
Some of those affected may have no symptoms, no symptoms, but their diagnosis confirms their failure, so researchers have suggested that those who had close contact with the confirmed have to be isolated and immersed in order to ensure the absence of disease.
China's comparison to those who have no symptoms was from a few to 44%.
A typical hot season (the period between the internance and the appearance of symptoms) has a distance from one to 14 days; usually five days. To illustrate uncertainty, to measure half of the people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and later down to 15%.
Other details of the spread of disease are still considered.
The disease believes that it is spread mainly during close contact with small droplets formed when you cough, sneeze, or speak; when the nearest contact is between 1 to 2 feet (2 to 6 m).
Studies have found that unburied coughs can lead to a distance of up to 15 feet [4.5 m] (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some have raised the possibility that the virus may be transmitted by tiny droplets that linger in the air, which may occur during conversation. The respiratory tract may also be formed during breathing, including when you speak, even though the virus is usually not airborne.
Cottons can sit in the mouths or noses of people nearby or if they are crawled into the lungs.
Other medical procedures, such as intubion and cariopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause respiratory infections to cool off and the result is air pollution.
It may also disappear when someone touches a infected area, which includes the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
If there is concern that it may be on the increase, the danger believes that it is low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of transmission of SARS-CV-2 by mouth after contact with the sewage. The virus has the risk of close contact during the first three days when symptoms appear even though the spread may occur before the outbreak of symptoms and the final stages of disease.
People have been diagnosed with the virus up to three days before symptoms indicate that transmission could occur before major symptoms developed.
Only a few of the reports of unprovable examples have been verified, but unmarked transmission has been carried out by some countries during a follow - up survey.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not clearly clear how disease spreads, one person is generally infected with two or three others. The virus continues to live for hours until more than things.
Pointedly, the virus is found to reach three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 in stainles stel, one day on cards, until four hours of copper.
This, however, varies from temperature and temperature to temperature. Home animals and other animals have actually been found with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit a virus to humans, even though British wounds command one to wash one’s hands after touching animals, as after touching infected areas that people may be infected.
The Severe aute respiratory system system coronavirus 2 (SARS-CV-2) is a new virus, which began to be separated from three persons who had pneumonia combined with a series of symptoms of respiratory infections at Wuhan.
All symptoms of the new SARS-CV-2 virus occur in a natural environment of coronaviruss. Without the human body, the virus dies with home keys, as it melts its outside defense. SARS-CV-2 closely related to the first SARS-CV.
The result is the origin of the vaccination from animal life.
Genetic research has revealed that the coronavirus is naturally linked with the Betacoronavirus, subtypes of the Sarbecovirus (linege B) and subjugats from the bats.
It is the same as 96% of the total number of samples for some bats. (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is a singlemino acid that differs from certain aspects of the genetic order between bacteria from pangolins and those of humans.
All genetic comparisons up to this day have found that it may be 92% of the original elements between the paronavirus cogolinus and SARS-CV-2, which are not enough to prove that the pangolins are central stores.
The transmission of the virus may be in some cases obtained by seeing the symptoms, though final confirmation comes at last by changing the transverse polymerase hin (rRT-PCR) of the crash or with a CT image.
Research that compares PCR to the Whan CT has raised that CT is much better sensitive than PCR, even though its appearance is lower, since many of its images are of a group of other hormones and diseases.
"From March 2020, the American College of Radioology asserts that "CT" should not be used for research or if it is the first process of checking COVID-19".
The WHO has published a number of RNA checks for SARS-CV-2, the first issued in 17 January.
Tests are using alcohol-time resuscitation poetry for polymerase (rRT-PCR).
A test can be made with respiratory or blood samples.
The results often occur within a few hours of the day.
This test is usually performed with a swalyngeal swali although the throat swabber can also be used. The number of moths and companies promote natural dyeing, which is able to obtain antibodies.
Since April 6, 2020, none of these have developed as well as qualified to be used everywhere.
In the US, tests of a natural process developed by Cellex are approved to be used with emergency conditions only with certificates only.
The properties of the icon in radiographs and computerized tomography (CT) for people who display symptoms include Asymmetric peripheral encyclopedia gladies and absoleteaural discharges.
The Italian Radioological Society combines the worldwide online database to be found with verified models.
Because of other diseases such as adenovirus, taking photographs without confirming the PCR has limited access to COVID-19.
A great study in China compares the results of CT and PCR chest and showed that although the image has a small degree of flexibility, it is faster and more sensitive, which elevates considerations as an exercise tool in the pidemiic areas of the epidemic.
Accelerational network based on antigenic intellation is developed so that they can examine the properties of the virus with both radioographs and CT.
Tactics against transmitting the virus include keeping entirely personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with soiled hands, and coughing or coughing through the toilet and putting the paper directly into the toilet.
Those who may have found themselves in a crowd are encouraged to wear a face mask in the community.
Human activities are also encouraged in the preservation of communication, which many governments have established or warned of the risks associated with travel and disaster - stricken countries.
Yet, the virus has reached the level of widespread contamination in parts of the world.
This means that the virus is still spread among communities, and some members of the community do not know where it is connected, and health workers who care for someone who may be infected are encouraged to use a set form of caution, caution for contact, and protection of the eyes. Follow the affected course of the health authorities to see the source of interaction and prevent further transmission.
The use of a local fence from the government for this purpose has removed the concern of privacy, the Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations are producing an advisory statement in this view.
There are already different paps of khalkals installed or promoted for voluntary use, and since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen team of experts working on related and confidential solutions, such as using Bluetooth to install a log for the user's closeness to other mechanics.
Users can now receive a message when it happens to be close to someone who has been tested to have a COVID-19. There are rounder views of anti-smotion methods; for example, the cleaning of the nose and the worrigging of the mohsh is not effective.
There is no problem for COVID-19, even though many organizations are working to build it.
Hand washing is encouraged to protect the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially when you leave the toilet or the muscles appear dirty; before eating; and after brushing, coughing, or sneezes.
The reason for this is that outside the human body, the virus is killed by a home soap, for it explodes its defense rifle.
The CDC also encouraged the use of an alcohol-based scanner and at least 60% of alcohol per Volume if soap and water are not available at the time.
WHO urges people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unclean hands.
The areas can be contaminated with a few solutions (between one minute of exposure to bacteria instead of a satellites system), including 62–71% of the ethanol, 50–100% of the Isopanool, 1,0.1% of sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% of hydrogen peroxide, and 02.5% of thepodone-iodine.
Some solutions, such as bassalsium chloride and chrohexidine glucote, work at low levels.
The CDC recommends that if the COVID model is criticized or confirmed in such places as office or day care, all places, such as offices, toilets, public areas, public equipment, such as libraries, portable screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM devices that patients have used, it must be killed by germs.
Health organizations recommend that people close their mouth and nose through an ax or a cough while coughing, or snout, and then quickly abandon any ticks.
Drums of surgery are pushed toward those who may be connected, since wearing a mask puts a limit on the amount and the amount of breathing gums coming out when you speak, pause, and cough.
WHO has issued directions on time and method of using a mask.
"As told by Stephen Griffin, a brainlogist at the University of Leeds," "Masking may reduce the tendency [of people] to touch the face, which is the greatest source of infection without proper handwashing. "The Masski" is also encouraged to be used by those who care for someone who may be ill."
WHO recommends that patients can wear masks only if they are in high risk, such as those who care for a COVID-19 person, although they also agree that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to promote the idea that members of the community must use the mask.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing a cloth mask rather than a health one. China has specifically encouraged that the members of the community are not sick using discarded health checks, especially when you are close to one another at least three feet [3 m] or under other people.
Hong Kong encourages wearing a surgical mask when taking public transportation or sitting in crowded places.
Health workers in Thailand’s area encourage people to make masks in their homes and clean them all day long.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia officially closed their entrance to the community without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
In March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask when he went to public places to protect himself and others.
The government in Austria insisted that everyone entering the restaurant should wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear a ruler check when they are in the community.
Taiwan, as it has continued to produce ten million masks a day from the middle of March, asking the passengers and city buses to wear the existing masks in April 1.
Panama has made it difficult to wear the face mask whenever you go out, while at the same time encouraging to build up a face mask at home for those who cannot afford your facial mask.
The most widely used masks in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Separated from living (also known as physical isolation) includes steps to control interpersonal connections intended to aggravate the spread of the disease by reducing close contact with people.
Roads include separations; travel barriers; and closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, tractors, and shopping centers.
Individuals may be able to use isolated means by living at home, by taking on a visit, by avoiding crowded places, by greeting without contact, and by physical isolation.
Many governments are now pressuring or encouraging social distancing in those areas affected by the plague.
The highest number of unions raised by the U.S. government and health agencies was suddenly reduced to 250 people (if there was no increase in the COVID-19 area), it was placed at 50 people, and later reached 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany officially closed a public gathering of more than two persons. The elderly and those with present health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, asthma, and compromised immune agents are faced with the risk of serious illness and problems and the CDC warned them to stay in the homes as much as possible in the affected public areas. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began using the term ' physical isolation' instead of that 's separating them from each other', so that it can be understood that the intention to reduce the same sex at the same time with the same sex is kept in the same way, as as a cry.
"Social isolation" and lead to the conclusion that people must have a full share in social isolation, may encourage them to keep in contact with others in different ways. Some authorities have issued guidelines for sexual health that can be applied in the meantime.
These include sexual urges only to have sex with a roommate, who does not have a virus or symptoms.
The separation from home is encouraged by those who have been found with the COVID-19 and who suspect that they may be infected.
Many governments have banned or even encouraged domestic violence in order to force health - care workers to break down.
The most heavy guidelines for closing at home are passed on to those in the most endangered groups.
Those who are likely to be exposed to someone with a COVID-19 and those who have recently visited the country or a widely distributed district have been encouraged that they have been locked up 14 days since the time of the last possible exposure.
Tactics to control the epidemic are closing or suppressing, and reducing.
Coverage is followed in the first phases of the plague and is intended to search out and separate those who are connected and that other anti - in - control programs are developed to prevent the disease from falling away to the rest of the population.
If it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are being made to reduce the rate: steps are taken to increase and reduce its effects in health care and society.
To avoid both closed and cut down can be followed at the same time.
Stress requires extreme measures to reduce the epidemic by reducing the average birthrate to less than 1. Part of the care for outbreaks of infectious disease is to try to reduce the plague’s peak, known as breaking down the line of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk that health services are found to be frustrating and allows more time for medicines and solutions to be developed.
Physical interventions that can prevent outbreaks include personal protective steps, such as physical hygiene, masking, physical steps intended to separate, such as closing schools and lighting public events; sharing in encouraging the public to accept and participate in such interventions as cleaning up the environment; and so by natural measures such as cleaning up the environment. The most difficult actions were taken in China when the size of puberty is clear, such as closing cities, and breaking the rules against tourism.
Other countries have also taken various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has opened up a public view and made internments, and gave warnings about the movement of those connected.
Singapore has been disabled by financial support for those who have been trapped and forced high wages on those who have not been able to do so regularly.
Taiwan has raised the present muski production and has imposed a penalty for the treatment of medical facilities. Great Britain and the U.S. models show that reductions (but not stopping the expansion of the epidemic) and pressure (to slow down the epidemic) are a major challenge.
The main reduction laws may reduce the serious need for health care by 2/3 and death in part, yet the end is the death of hundreds of thousands and the frustration of health programs.
Pressure may be better but it needs to be kept as long as the virus continues to surround human society (or until the solution comes, if that comes first), as transmission rises rapidly when steps are released.
The prolonged exposure to the plague creates social and economic costs.
There are no drugs directly authorized to combat COVID-19, but efforts to build them are still on the way, including testing existing drugs.
Taking medication from stores, drinking liquids, and resting may help ease the symptoms.
Depending on the difficulty, the treatment of breathing air, fresh fluid, and the support of breathing may be necessary.
Using steroids may delay the results.
Many elements that have been authorized for the operation of other growing diseases are being investigated for use in treating COVID-19.

A reppiratory coronavirus testing 2019 Covid-19 and the SARS-CV-2 virus related to it include methods of detecting the presence of thevirus and those who see antibodies as a result if one is infected.
The presence ofviruses in the datas is verified by RT-PCR that sees the presence of the RNA coronavirus.
This research is done particularly to investigate the SARS-Cov-2-virus.
It is used to confirm the recent or current diagnosis of disease.
An antiboditions, inserology, can be used either for a person's diagnosis or for a community service.
Antibody studies show how many people have developed disease as well as those whose symptoms were too small that they had no symptoms at all.
The exact number of deaths due to this disease and the extent of the inevitability of the majority of society can be traced to the outcome of the test.
As a result of estimates, by March 2020, no countries have had any reliable statistics on the number of the presence of the virus in their society.
By 23 March, no country had studied more than 3 of the people in their countries and there is a significant difference in the number of statistics that have been conducted in various countries.
These differences may have a profound effect on reported death rates that may rise in some countries.
With the use of re-time translate polymerasse polymerase (RT-PCR), this check can be made in a variety of supported respirations, including nasopharancy and sputum.
The results are usually found between two hours and 2 days.
A RT-PCR test made by a swab of throats can only be reliable in the early church for cases.
In the future, the virus may disappear from the throat but continues to increase in the lungs.
For infected people who have been tested in the second week, some of the steel mattressals can be removed from the bottom of the steeding system or by pushing a mattressel, sputim, which can be used.
Some of the first PCR methods were developed in the Crimes in Berlin in January 2020 by the use of re-time recycled insights into the process by means of reservation voterase action, RRT-PCR, which provides the basis for the circulation of 250,000 Points is the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom also developed a method of checking on 23 January 2020. The Kogenebiot Company of South Korea developed the PCR-based SARSCV-2 kit for a medical test on 28 January 2020.
"Search" E-gene" the same for all beta connaviruses and RdRp gene found only in SARS-CV-2. In China, the BGI Group was one of the companies that received the approval of the National Products Administration to use the PCAR-based SARS-CV-2. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, distributed 2019-Novel Corval-19, Novet-CD, Rent-Resssive Rental-Centals for research.
Three genetic test models in the old ways of quick tests resulted in unclear results because of poor reathetics and poor checking tests at the CDC in Atlanta, this resulted in a ratio of less than 100 yards per day that succeeded throughout February 2020.
The testing is not found to be reliable until 28 February 2020 and until that time when regional and local research stations are allowed to begin.
This method of testing was authorized by Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Administration. The independent survey centers began a test at the beginning of March 2020.
The Lamb Corp announced the international access to the COVID-19 assessment based on RT-PCR
The Quest Diagnotics likewise conducted a COVID-19 findings from 9 March 2020
No mathematical limits were announced, collecting and digesting of the specmen should be done according to the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR
In 11 February 2020 this method of testing was registered by the Federal Service for Survey in Health20. By 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop the mode of checking for OVID-19. In March 13, 2020, the Roche Diagnos received permission for the FDA type of testing that could be done within 3.5 hours. In doing so, it allowed one machine to make a 4128 study in 24 hours.
In March 2020, the FDA has issued the Abbot Laboratories a mandate for critical times, the EU, to check on the Abbott m2,000 policy, the FDA has given the Hogic, the LambCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21- March 2020, the Cepheid has likewise received EUA with the FDA form of testing type that takes about 45 minutes.
FDA has allowed the type of test using the sothermal nucecic substance substance substance abuse instead of PCR.
Because this does not require a series of cycles of cold and heat, this type can provide the consequences of postitive in a few minutes for five minutes with negatives in 13 minutes.
At present there are some 18,000 machinery in the U.S. and Abbot is expected to increase its performance in order to produce 50,000 daily tests. A study using monoclon antibody especially adheres to nucleopsid protein, Nprotein, novel connavirus is being improved in Taiwan in hopes that it will be possible to yield results in 15 to 20 minutes like influenza.
"Repetition of March 2020 concluded that "" heart madiographs do not help in the first chapters and that CT, computer tomography, may exist before symptoms of the disease begin to occur."
Common features of CT include a bilateral multiular multibar-grand-Glass eparative, asymetricand posteritor responsible.
Subpleulal performance, crazy paring and condication is growing as the disease changes.
A survey that compares the PCR to the Wuhan at the site where the epidemic started suggests that CT is more sensitive than PCR but has no details, many of which are compatible with other pneumonia and disease procedures.
"By March 2020, the American College of Radioology recommends that "CT" may be used to distinguish or evaluate COVID-19 for the first time" according to March 2020, the CDC encourages PCR on first death" "
Part of the munse in the treatment of the disease is the production of antibodies including Igm and IgG.
These can be used to monitor the existence of disease from the past seven days or more, in order to manifest a lack of resistance and employment for the public. Asssays can be made up of major research centers, CLTs, or by point-of-caring, PCT.
The high rate of automad systems in many medical research centers will be able to work with the services, but their availability will depend on the vine for individual production.
With CRL, we are alone in the normal use of the peripheral blood, even though sericins are used for the reactions of the body soldiers.
By PCT, single blood spocimen is usually found by rubbing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, rescue action is not necessary before the period. By 26 March 2020, FDA introduced 29 terms that reported this act as necessary and now are able to spread antibody test.
For 7 April 2020, only one method of testing is allowed by the FDA under the supervision of critical conditions. At the end of March 2020, the Euroimiium Medical Laboratory Diagnoss and Epitome Diagnos found the approval of its European observer who could check to see the IgG and IgA anti-virus in their blood cells.
The amount of testing is several hundred copies during the hour and is much faster than the PCR environment of the Child RNA.
The presence of antibodies is usually diagnosed after 14 days of infection. In April, the UK found that not one of the antibody teats that he had bought would be effective.
"Hong Kong is a program in which patients are suspected can stay at home, "the emergency of the conditions to give the patient a specmen tube", to open the door, back and get the results after a while. The British NHS has announced that it is starting a search program to reduce the risk that the patient has joined others when going to the hospital or the need to have an infection to kill the patient if there is a need. Concerning the illness of the COV-19 will not fall into the car, the health worker will take advantage of the best use."
South Korea has helped the South Korea to make a very rapid, very focused study in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statistics Health Investigation Physicians spoke on 2 March, stating that there were some 12,000 screenings a day on the alarm system and a survey of 10,700 had been conducted in the past week.

"The first survey of the library showed that from the 12-20th week of the calendar the total of samples at least 483,225 were tested and included 12/204 samples and 333.491 samples(6.9%) during the survey she confirmed SARS-CV-2. Israel, researchers at Technion and Ramm Hospital and tested the test of the samples of 64 patients at the same time, by including the test in which she was confirming the Edo's 6-20%.[3]
Since the building was still assigned to the BGI founder Wang Jian and took 5 days, modeling indicates that the examples in Hubei would be up by 47% and the necessary cost to meet the arrest would be twice as long as the ability to include experiments that were not available in time.
The Wuhan Republic is quickly followed by the tables of Huo-Yan at Shenzhen, Tinjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities in all China.
From 4 March 2020 the total of daily transmissions to 50,000 studies per day. In an open source, the intricate drawings released by Origami Asssays have been opened so that they can examine the samples of many patients until 12121 in COVID19 are used only 93. These technologically similar drawings can operate on small computers without the need for boilers.
Since March, the shortage and adequate number of reagent has become a major factor in testing the majority between the EU and the UK and the US.
This has led some writers to examine the legal methods of providing samples that involve a global warming of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free more RNA elements. In March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now examining the number of their people now looking at Coronavirus per head than any other country, and they have been walking on a good foot in the height of testing to reach a large portion of the population.
"This was a combination to include the power to pass by, and to buy a collection-scanemas-throught laboratory from the Group 42 and BGI (based on "Huo-Yan" degree of visualation in China").
Built in 14 days, the moth is able to direct tens of thousands of tests with RT-PCR per day and the first in the world of this operating rate outside China.
Various techniques of insight into different coronavirus elements are built in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization opted for the German construction program for the construction of fasts sent to countries in need of funds without their own building skills.
The German policy was published on 17 January 2020; the policy instituted by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not achieved until 28 January, it delayed a study available in the U.S. and the United States to deal with the security problems of plant research at the beginning of outbreaks, and these countries and Australia were unable to build and produce sufficient materials to satisfy the need and encourage health experts.
In contrast, experts say that the wide availability of surveys in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The power of testing, especially in independent libraries, is built over the years by the government of South Korea.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the empowerment of screening techniques as the best way to fuel the COVID-19 virus infection. The high need for screening due to the spread of the virus caused the concentration of thousands of workers in U.S. libraries independent, and the removal of the sabs and chemicals of the bugs was stressful.
In March 2020 China reported problems on the accuracy of her check-up boxes.
"In the United States, CDC scans are found "" with errors" the government removed the law walls that prevented private investigations. Spain bought tickets from the Shenzhen Bioasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate."
The company explained that the wrong results may be due to judicial decisions to collect samples or to use stoves in the right way.
The Spanish Ministry said that it would produce the carves that caused bad results, and it will put in their room a different set of fasts built by the Shenzhen Bioiesy. 80% of the Czech Republic inspection operations in China produced the wrong results. Slovakia bought a 1.2 million checkpoints in China found to be accurate.
"Prime Minister Matovič promoted it to be discarded in the Danube. Ateş Kara of Turkish Health Ministry said that Turkey checked sites in China were found "and the high level of errors" was not "used." The UK bought 3.5 million search boats in China but at the beginning of April 2020 announced that they were not used."

To wash hands (or wash hands), also known as hand washing, hand washing with the intention of removing soil, glass, small objects, or slips.
Cleaning hands with soap at those ‘ critical times ’ during the day protects the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which combine with oral hygiene.
People can also become infected with respiratory infections such as colds or ordinary colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, symptoms that have not yet developed).
The five critical moments during the day when soap washing is essential include: before and after preparing, after washing the infant’s breasts or changing diapers, before and after feeding the infant, before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing meals.
Before and after treatment.
After changing diapers or cleaning the child that uses the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing, or coughing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal waste.
Physical hygiene refers to hygienic measures connected with medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or treatment can protect or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main purpose of handwashing is to wash the hands of the peripheres (bacterials, viruses, or other agents that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially important to people who carry food or work in the medical field, but it is a vital procedure even for the common community.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of colds, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; to protect the joint causes of diarrhea; to reduce respiratory infections;
and reduce the mortality rate of infants in the womb.
The 2013 survey showed that advanced handwashing process may lead to a lower rate of development during the development of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of young people associated with respiratory infections and diarrhea can be reduced by starting a simple life - style, such as washing hands with soap.
A simple action can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by about 50%.
Steering methods that promote soap washing can reduce diarrhea in three parts, and this can be compared to cleaning clean water in poor areas.
The decline of diapers by 48% can be linked to soap washing. Handwashing is one of the most effective and cost - effective methods to protect diarrhea and acupitory activity (ARI), such as an automatic behavior occurring in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
The hymonia, a large ARI, leads alone as a cause of death for babies under five years of age, destroys the health of an estimated 1.2 million children each year.
The diarrhea and pneumonia both contribute to the death of about 3.5 million babies each year.
According to UNICEF, converting hands to soap before and after using the toilet to become a strict routine can save more health than any single treatment or medical intervention, determining death due to diarrhea at least half and death from respiratory infections in one part.
Handwashing is often combined with other access to waste disposal as part of the water, disposal programs and sanitation (WASH).
Handwashing also protects against the disease of the Imperial transmitted by direct contact.
A minor accident is the effect of regularly washing your hands on your skin because of skin dry.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can result in bites, a leather condition known as dredge, or hend dermatitis, which is most common to people who are health - care workers.
More often hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of ozone-compulsive disk (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when handwashing is important to reduce the transmission of the disease by oral hygiene: after use of the toilet (to wash, relieve yourself), after cleaning the infant’s roasting (translating the diapers), after feeding the infant, before feeding or before or after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or birds.
Other times when proper handwashing should be followed in order to avoid the spread of the disease include before and after handling a cut or injuries; after a sneeze, cough, or cough; after touching an animal’s hair or handling animals; and after handling dirt.
In many countries, there is a low level of soap washing.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families follow a soap - washing process. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had a maximum rate of 97 percent; the United States near the middle of 7 percent; and China at a very low rate of 23 percent. A few traditional practices are now in developing the practice of handwashing the practice at critical times. To wash hands as a group at the appointed time of children in one developing countries.
The "Essential Health Care Program" launched by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the work of encouraging the health of children and education.
Twice a year, accompanied by regularly washing hands with soap, brushing daily with fluoride, is a model of the world order.
It is also successfully launched in Indonesia.
Removing microorganism from the skin is better for soap or cleaning water.
The main work of soap and sanitation is to reduce the obstacles to the solution, and raise the soluability.
Water alone is not enough to cleanse the skin because fat and protein, which are material, do not easily melt into water.
But sanitation helps keep the flow of water in its proper place.
A tiny soap, which is able to reuse, may keep the virus alive in advance.
A small number of studies that monitor the transmission of the virus from the infected gland in the feces conclude that it is impossible to keep clear of bacteria and viruses.
The CDC continues and is still "a glass and handling without hands is better."
Antiviral soaps are widely advertised by health - care community members.
To this day, there is no evidence that using antigens or disinfects is suggested to select natural antibioids.
However, antibacterial soaps have normal antibacterial representatives such as triclosan, which has a long list of the greater variety of organisms.
Thus, even if the antibibiotic resanttries are not selected by antibacterial soap, they may be able to function properly in the way they are sold.
Otherwise surfactant and a representative of the skin, complex structures may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, acetic acid) as a controlling pH, antimitrobilique benic acid, and other skin stores (aloe verba, vitamin, etc, pacts). A thorough examination of the U.S. University of Orregon School of Public Health showed that non-exacts are effective in the same way as consummertics of anti-idials.
Hot water that you cannot wash your hands does not burn to the right degree so that you can die of germs.
Bacteria grow very much when the temperature of the lake is 36°C.
Yet, hot, soapy water works better than cold water, which contains soap from natural oil that captures soil and germs.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that the use of warm water may not contribute to the reduction of microbial lead in hands.
The vanitizer or the unicode antiseptic is a symbol of water-made righting.
At the end of the 1990s and early part of the 21st century, the representatives of hand washing with alcohol (also known as alcool-bed dubs, anti-antiententithinth manbs, or manizers) began to experience a louding.
Many based on the sopropyl alcohol or ethanol that was grown together with a hot agent like Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) made it an artificial, or a squirtant like glycerin, or a foam to make it easier to use and reduce the taste of alcohol.
Imperation hydrogen-peroxide enhances the production of antivirals. An alcohir might be 60 to 95% effectively kill bacteria.
Alcohol rub sanitizer kills germs, multizers-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other bacteria (including HIV, Herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vanciniana, influenza, and hepatitis).
Alcohol bunitizes have 70% of alcohol kills 99.97% (-3.5 kg), like 35 decibels per decomposition) of hand infections in 30 seconds after urinating with 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 kg) of bacteria in the hand 1 minute after urinating. Hand cells operate better and less in certain bacteria.
An alcool-initer might be virtually useless to the nonrovirus (or Norrolk) kind of bacteria, the main cause of a polystroteritetics in combination. sufficient antiseptic or alcohol should be used to soften it completely or cover both hands.
The front and back of both the hands and the inner and the ends of the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, the foam or the gear is dry.
The fingers must be washed with them, rubbed on both hands. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention encourages washing hands rather than rubbing their hands with sanitizers, a knob when the hands are clearly white.
The rise in the use of these representatives is due to their simple performance and quickness to kill micro-organisms; however, they should be used to replace proper handwashing except where soap and water are not available.
A constant use of a sunninizers based on alcohol can cause dry skin unless ammonillents and/or skin braces are added to the mixture.
An alcool dry process can be reduced or eliminated by inserting glycerin and/or enzymes into a combination.
In a medical study, alcocols are based on almollants that make more pleasant skin and dryer than soap or alcohol containing antimicrobials.
Allergic concatatitis, contamination or hyperactivity to alcohol or acidis are present in non-alcuits that are rarely available.
The lower condition of causing eyearrit contamination to be appealing when compared with the washing of hands with soap and water.
Regardless of their effectiveness, waterless agents cannot wash their hands from natural elements, but they simply kill germs.
This is why the mand sanitizers are not as efficient as soap and water in preventing the spread of many polyhogens, as Pathogens continue to be in their hands.
The success of non-Alcohol-and-subs is largely dependent on the input and combinations, and by history they are more efficient than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
More recently, combinations using basalconium chloride have shown the persistence and increase of antiviral activity after anointing, in contrast with alcohol, which has been shown to lower function after repeated working, may be the reason for continued reaction to the skin.
Many people in economically poor communities cannot buy soap and use ash or dust instead of it.
The ashes or soil may function better than the water, but it works less than the soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash detects the contamination of micro-organisms may raise the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, copper is also a agent of antibacterial water because when mixed with water, a mixture of alkaline is formed.
WHO encourages ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
The proper handwashing process encouraged by the US Centers for Disease Control for Prevention of Transmission of Disease include:
Wash your hands with cold or cold water.
Flowing water is recommended because standing batteries may be contaminated, and the temperature of the water does not show the difference.
Wash your hands with adequate soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
A soap carries germs to the skin, and studies show that people often clean their hands when soap is available rather than when they use water.
Lose at least 20 seconds.
Inflammation produces heat, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and long - term spraying removes more bacteria.
Clean up well under running water.
Pollution can cause the hands to become dirty
A clean towel or allow for dry in the air.
Droughts of water and shiny hands are sensitive to dirt — areas that are easily forgotten by the thumb, the effect, the middle of the fingers, and under the nails.
Nail polylish fittings can store microorganisms.
A winnowing lead is often encouraged to keep your hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can raise the spread of infection.
Different inexpensive procedures can be made to meet hand washing where tap water and/ or soap are not available. To supply water by showing a vessel or drum with suitable openings and/or using ash if needed in developing countries. In conditions with limited water (such as schools or rural areas in the developing countries), there are expensive methods for saving water, such as "trip-taps" and other kinds of saving money.
Tippy-tap is a simple device for handling a rope, and a foot-mill that gives little water to the hands and soap barrel.
Practical handwashing is an important part of the process of handwashing, but there is a debate over the best method of cleaning in public areas.
A growing level of research suggests that paper towels are better cleaner than electric gases found in clean areas.
In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and supported by the European Tissue Symposium firm, to compare the standards of cleanliness found in paper towels, hot-burning handts, and late - hand dry air.
After washing and drying the hands with hot flashes, the total number of bacteria was found to be rising at the rate of the fingers in 1944% and at hand feet 254%.
Steering was effective at the height of the total number of bacteria on the fingers by 42% and at the hands of the hand by 15%.
After washing and drying the paper, the total amount of the virus fell on the fingers by 76% and on the fingers by 7%. Scientists also took up a study that would reveal if there was a chance of joining the bodies of cleaning and cleaning areas as a result of each method of drying.
A fast air pump, which absorbs air from it at a fixed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to avoid micro-organisms in their hands and nearly join other users in a space of about 2 metres.
The use of hot air has stored micro-organisms to a depth of 1.25 feet [0.25 m] from the boiler.
The margins did not show the obvious breakdowns of micro-organisms. In 2005, research conducted by the TEV Produk undult und Kult, different methods of laying up hands were tested.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after the laying of the hands were noted:
There are many manual manufacturers available, and hand braces have been compared to dry in thepaper towels.
Washing hands using deinitings is another way when traveling in soap and water.
An alcool - built tiniter has to have alcohol at least 60%.
Medical washing was long forced after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis found his functioning (in 1846) to protect the disease in the hospital area.
There are electric generators operating with a note reminding hospital workers to wash their hands when they forget them.
One study has found a reduction in disease levels by their effectiveness.
Medically washing is 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gas to anoint or rubb each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed together by pointing their fingers.
If there is pollution under the nails, the crystal brusque can be used to remove it.
Since germs can stay in the water in the hands of the hands, it is important to thoroughly clean and dry up with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to shut down water (and open any exit door if possible).
This avoid doing any further harm to your hands in such areas.
The idea of washing hands in the environment of care to remove perogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing goes on to an unacceptable degree in many medical areas, a large number of doctors and nurses continually forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and then transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that simple hand washings and other simple procedures may lower the level of catter-releted blood pressure in 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a chart showing the system for handwashing and washing hands in the field of health care.
Organizational guidelines for the clean - up organization can be found on its cassette so that the public can observe it.
The necessary return should be directed by Whatby etl.
Clusters in stores can measure and ensure the purity of the hands, if they are to prove and comply with the law.
The World Health Organization has "five times" to wash hands:
after transfusion
before the function of an objectpttic, once.
and after the care of the patient. Getting anti-spiratory chemicals into the diaphragm ("cancer" or soaps "antiviruses") gives the power to kill in that handwashing.
That power may be required before surgery or in cases where antibiotic-restantorisms are plentiful. 'Practicing to someone for the purpose of surgery, it is necessary to have a pump that can be opened and closed without touching by hand, chlohedy or iodine ash, sterile towels to dry after washing, and sterile rub, and another wash system under the feet.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and arms to the back, usually 2-6 minutes.
The longer periods of rolling (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When you do, the water in the arm should be shut off without running back into the hands.
After finishing hand washing, the hands are stopped with a metal cloth or the operating cloth is worn.
To reduce the spread of the virus, it is best to wash the hands of the hands or use hand - to - hand antibiotic before and after treatment.
In order to control staphyloccal diseases in hospitals, it has been found that great gain from clean hands comes from the first 20% of the first cleaning, and that very little more help is available when resuscitation is increased to more than 35%.
Sweeping with empty soap has a three-fold effect of eating contaminated food when compared with cleaning alcohol by alcohol-bebug control. To compare the hand-bombing with abal-bod solution solution. To compare with the million ishing with an antibacterial device for a metarian time of 30 seconds.
But soap and water function better than alcohol-bebed hambs in reducing H11 influenza A virus and Clordium Deficole pumps in the hands. The intervention to improve handkeeping in health care conditions may include teaching workers by washing hands, raising the availability of alcohol-bad rub, and reminders written and said to the staff.
There is a need for further research that examines which of these methods of intervention works best in different health care conditions.
In developing countries, soap washing is recognized as a means of saving, an important aid in achieving good health, and even physical nutrition.
Yet, a lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people’s homes, schools, and workplace make it a challenge to meet the world’s standards of cleaning hands.
In many rural Africa, for example, handwashing pumps near private or public toilets are scarce, even though there are no shortcuts for the construction of handwashing.
Yet, low hand washing rates may be a reason for more deeply entrenched practices than that of the lack of soap or water.
Advertising and standing up for the use of soap can contribute to legal decisions, raise caution against the benefits of handwashing, and lead to a change in public manners.
For this to be effective, vigilance and a certain course of action is essential.
A careful review of 70 surveys has found that the methods of the public are effective in promoting the cleaning of the LMICs, while social advertising campaigns are less effective. One example of advertising to clean the hands in schools is UNICEF's "The Third Star Way" that encourages schools to take simple, smoothing steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, during other sanitary requirements.
When small amounts are reached, schools can range from one to three stars.
Building handwashing can be part of a campaign to clean hands to reduce disease and death for infants.
World's Day of Cleaning Hands by one of the examples of active campaigns that attempt to achieve a change of habits. As a result of the 2019-20 connavirus epidemic, UNICEF advertised the widespread use of the hydraulism.
A few studies have considered the total cost of handwashing in developing countries and social connections and prevention of DALYs.
One return, however, raises the fact that advertising by soaps saves more money than other access to water and washing.
The importance of washing one’s hands — especially for people in weak conditions such as newly brought or injured soldiers in hospitals — was first noted in the mid - 19th century by two means of handwashro: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale.
At that time many people still believed that disease was caused by bad odors called maasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks from food and medical - related diseases led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more hand washing as an important means of preventing the spread of disease.
The outbreak of the mosquito flu in 2009 and the COVID - 19 epidemic in 2020 has led to greater caution in many countries regarding the importance of soap washing to protect oneself from this type of infectious disease.
For example, posters with the text "The proper washing procedure" are placed on top of a washroom in public toilets and private rooms in the offices and airports in Germany.
The phrase "Clean your hands" means to be clear from someone else’s responsibility or involvement in it.
Its roots are part of the Bible in Matthew’s account when Pontius Pilate washed his hands in making a decision to impasse Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in some English communities.
In the Macbeth of Shakespeare, Queen Macbeth first forced her to wash her hands in an attempt to clear herself of the proposed pollution, which represents a guilty conscience concerning the crimes she had committed and persuaded her husband to do it.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or thinking about wrong acts, often do better than others, often increase their appreciation for the value of cleaning hands.
Moreover, when they are not allowed to wash their hands afterward they are less likely to share in the "clean" activities, such as volunteer activities.
Religion encourages the cleansing of hands by both the purpose of cleanliness and the symbol. It is an example in washing hands, using water but without soap to wash hands, it is part of the process of washing hands in many religions, including the Bahha'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and tetlat dynasy in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religious religions also encourage the cleansing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam force hand washing after using the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam force hands to wash their hands before and after meals.
COVID - 19 Risk Management Management Management
Risk controls instead of the COVID-19 use of special control mechanisms for control of occupational safety and healths in screening for prevention of cryhonavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate control of an accident in the workplace depends on the operation and type of work, by supporting screening the risk of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors for individual employees who may be weak to prevent COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Officeal Safety and Health Administration (WHO), low - risk operations have a lower level of contact with the public and other employees, which simple safety measures are encouraged, include washing hands, encouraging employees to stay in homes when sick, breathing habits, and keeping the system clean and killing bacteria in the workplace.
Risk factors include those that require constant contact and are close to people who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but they may be infected because of ongoing social transmission or travel to foreign countries.
This includes employees who can contact the common people like schools, crowded labor, and crowded market conditions.
The risk controls in this group, in addition to simple preventive measures, include high-efficiency signals, sneezers, and specialized software processing available in cases where a COVID-19 is found.
The OSHA views health workers who are exposed to prominent people or suspected of having COVID-19 as high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure when workers make aerosol-genreating proce revealers, or take or carry an apecimens from people who are known or suspected by COVID-19.
The necessary safety controls in these operations include building controls such as non-invasive pressure systems, and proper personal processes at work.
The development of the*COVID-19 may have serious consequences within the operation area.
Employees may not be at work because of sickness, the need to care for others, or the fear of having an opportunity to be approached.
Marketing habits may change, both of which are necessary, with ways to get these items (such as buying at a time not busy or with being sent or with driving duties).
Finally, the sending of items from the hard-flamed areas of COVID-19 may be disturbed. Preparation for a related disease and response program can be used to regulate safety activities.
Programs view the risks involved in different workplaces and types of work, including types of exposure, dangers that arise at home or in public situations, and the hazards of individuals as high age or of chronic illnesses.
They also explain the proper control over those risks, and the following programs on situations may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparation for a related illness and a response program may depend on the promotion of national or regional law.
The goals of responding to the mood include reducing labor among employees, protecting people at high risk for serious health problems, keeping business jobs, and reducing serious effects on other businesses and purchases.
The difficulty of disease in society is a business that affects the steps taken.
The safety control steps are the most widely used in octopical safety and healths to combine the risk controls with the results.
When the dangers of COVID-19 are not removed, the control that works best for building control, is followed by the control of the handling, and finally the protection of personal safety.
Construction management involves separating workers from work - related accidents without relying on a worker’s habit, and it can be a far - reaching option when it is put into operation.
Operational management systems or procedures that require an employee or employer's action
Personal health processes (PPPE) think more effectively than control of building and management, but it can help avoid some exposure.
All types of PPE must be chosen on the basis of the operation risk, properly dressed as appropriate (e.g., outperets), always worn and in the way, checked, stored, and changed, according to the need, and removed properly, cleaned, and kept or disposed of.
According to the U.S. Officeal Safety and Health Administration (SHA), low exposure activities have little to do with society and other age groups.
Simple measures to protect the virus from all workplaces include frequent and thorough washing of hands, encouraging employees to stay at home when they are sick, wholesome breathing habits that include covering and cooling, diuretics and diuretics, preparing for domestic work or stoves, encouraging employees to avoid using other tools and equipment, and continuing to keep the process of cleaning and disinfection in the workplace.
Early detection and isolation of people who may be infected are an important step in protecting employees, customers, employers, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with anti-spiration symptoms should stay at home until they can no longer be warm, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using antidepressive or anti - inflammatory drugs, and that the rules of the days of illness are delayed, allow workers to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that the staff know these rules.
According to the OSHA, the activities of the middle - aged include those activities that require regular contact with or near 6 (1.8 m) with unknown people who are suspected of being COVID - 19 patients, have the SARS-CV-2 virus due to continued interaction in the society near the workplace, or because someone has recently returned from an outside world that has an increased contact with COVID-19.
These include employees who are associated with the general public as schools, high operating facilities, and high market conditions. Building controls of these high - risk groups include install lofty anti-subordinates, raise up operations, install barriers such as plastic stoppers, set limits by driving the terminals, and set up a window for transporting the media network. The management control of this high job group includes encouraging sick people to stay in their homes, install communication system, including the use of face system, to set up high-levels, stop operations, stop operations, stop operating operations, stop operations, kill, stop operations, stop operations, stop operations, stop operations, stop operations, kill, and kill, stop operations, stop operations, stop operations, stop operations, and kill weapons.
The staff of the trauma group seldom need to use a repirespire.
If a person begins to get sick in a plane, appropriate control programs for rebellion against employees and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 krew to care for the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person, or asking the patient to cover his mouth and nose when he coughs or sneezes.
A shirt must wear gloves when caring for a sick passenger or affecting body fluids or areas that may be contaminated, and it may be more protective if the patient has a fever, a persistent cough, and a difficulty in breathing.
Glalass and other lost items should be discarded with a biohazard bag, and areas that have found pollution must be cleaned and contaminated later. In the case of merchant ships, including tourist ships and other transporters, harbor control includes slowing travel when sick, and introducing themselves and informing the center of the treatment immediately if someone begins to burn or other symptoms while riding.
If possible, a medical procedure must be performed in a separate school and day care center. In schools and day care, the CDC encourages temporary screening and screening if a infected person has been inside the school building at any rate.
If there is a slight shift to the middle of the population, permanent divorce strategies may have been started as fueling for thefield trip, meetings, and other large gatherings such as natural education, vacationing classes or feeding classes, extending space between desks, arriving in minutes and coming home, taking in visitors, and using a different office of children with flulike symptoms.
When the virus spreads dramatically to the public, despite the efforts of isolated people, it may be considered closed schools. Of the day - to - day law workers, the health risk is then considered lower by the CDC.
Legal personnel who must contact certain people who are convinced or suspected of having a COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as those who are employed in emergency health emergencies, as well as human safety requirements.
If more closeness occurs when one is found, the workers should clean and remove the germs from their work belts and clothes before they can reuse them with a spray or cleaning cloth, and follow the usual measures to prevent the spread of the virus and disposal of PPE used and the washing of clothes.
The OSHA estimates that some medical and respiratory workers are at greater or greater risk of exposure to disease.
The services of those exposed to serious risk include donors, relief supplies, ambulances, and medical personnel who are exposed to known patients or suspect that they have COVID-19.
These become the greatest risk of exposure to disease if employees perform procedures that produce aerosol, or collect or handle samples, from known patients or suspected of having COVID-19.
The processes that develop aerosol include the intramuscular injection, refractions, bronchoscopies, procedures and dental examinations, or the removal of the body samples.
The respiratory functions of exposure to the most dangerous disease include personnel involved in preparing bodies for known or suspecting that they have a COVID-19 when they die; these become a major risk if they study dead bodies. More computer systems of these groups include separate living rooms with known or suspects that have COVID-19, which include the development of aerorosol programs.
Special air pressure with lead pressure can be suitable for some medical and air - conditioning containers.
Samples should be carried with Biosity Level safety guidelines 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into special waiting centers by being suspected of having aOVID-19. More than any other PPPE, OSHA encourages orchestras for those who work far away from 6 knots and well - known patients, or suspect that they have the SARS-CV-2 virus, and those who develop aerool programs.
In the United States, NIOSH or better-servative satellites should be used as a form of full - written defense program, which includes exercise, exercise, and medical examinations.
Some kinds of satellites can provide much more protection and improve the effectiveness of the worker. WHO does not promote the environmentals, because COVID-19 is a disease not transmitted by oral fluid.
WHO recommends only surgery masks for decomposition workers in the entrance areas.
For those who collect secondhand smoke samples, carers, or transport the COVID-19 patients without aerosol methods, WHO encourages surgery masks, glasses, or faceeld, gauun, and galoph.
When aerosol method is developed, a N95 or FFP2 scan instead of surgery masks.
Because PPPE is not available enough in the world, WHO encourages reducing the need for PPPE by telephone contact with patients, natural masks such as windows showing, which only allow those directly involved in the treatment to enter a clinic with COVID-19, use only the needed PPE on a particular job, and continue to use the same diagnosis without removing it while caring for many patients with the same disease, being cautious and controlling PPE's access, and restricting the use of masks to people who have no symptoms.

PRESENTATION: [Covid-19] Reduction and preparation for the future
DAY/ force: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
ASSETS: CC0: No rights denied
We find ourselves in a situation very unusual for this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a fact that makes clear how people in the world are connected with our burdens on one another.
We have never faced the same challenges, but we know that our reaction is largely based on the kind of empathy, cooperation, and social factors that are at the root of the organization.
The cooperation and care that we have seen in all our employees by e - mails, phone calls, and chats is a remarkable guarantee that we have good people with whom to work.
I am truly happy and proud to work along with you.
A week ago, someone told me how much he appreciated our work.
He reminded me of how logical it is for the world to be able to open Wikipedia right now, and this is a powerful symbol for this most important source to be found on the Internet and available to everyone.
Your work is doing this, whether you are keeping an open record or our employees or are working in our community.
The world needs the information available in Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when we do not only what we do but also how we do it, which will have a powerful impact on the earth.
Because of the importance of this work and your role in it, we will make significant changes in our relationship with each other, from the next few weeks.
Changes in Our Work and Assignment
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the gang has met last evening and discussed how we will work with our day and months to come.
In that discussion, we have considered what we feel will be a positive response to what we are dealing with and the best way to keep the organization going during this time.
We can expect to get away with stress and support our long - term goal.
If you need to drive again, it is all right.
Of all the workers, labor companies, and labor workers:
Our expected daily activity will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until the change is announced.
We do not preach a holiday if you can work longer hours, so a company may use it.
However, things are uncertain to the world now, and whether you have to care for loved ones, buy food, or go to a doctor, your health comes first.
He will not follow your course of action.
If you are sick, don’t do anything.
We really do not have to say that, but we will.
You don't have to install sick days or PTO - you will simply tell your supervisor and help your team to reorganize the calendars and elevators to ensure that the main parts of the work are being accomplished.
( If it is found that you have a COVID-19 virus, please tell Bryan between the T&C Ops so that the T&C will be able to help you with support and make sure that your condition is properly cared for by the management).
Hour - hour workers will be fully paid.
We have already said it, and we are eager to fulfill our obligations to our employees and those working hours.
Everyone will be paid according to his normal working hours in normal conditions.
This includes getting sick and not being able to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to cope with stress.
What we do can be very rewarding, especially at times like this.
Once again, it is important to take care of yourself.
We invite you to contact your supervisor, so that we can know what to expect and plan accordingly.
Some work is even considered important.
There are things we must continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraiing (among others) are doing a crucial task that may require further support.
We will start with every move and all doors to investigate the present goals and focus our attention on supporting what is important in our goal.
All of us have much to do, and all of us will concentrate on the most important projects.
Simplifying now will not harm us later.
We do not plan to "work again to hold the elevator" when the epidemic is over.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to complete a job at an unusual time right now.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work at setting new goals and new times when appropriate.
What happens to the APP (Annnual Planning)?
In order to change our new circumstances and the work hours we are expecting every day, it is our goal to change the sending of our Annual Plan for 20-201.
Our aim is to suggest the extension of our 20th - 2020s, which allows more time to make up a budget to allow workers to take on more important tasks, take care of themselves, and care of their loved ones while assisting those who need or wish to work less in the next few weeks.
This extension of the working period greatly reduces the current work schedule and pressures that are being imposed on the rest of the organization.
We will introduce what we wish to do to Bodi the next week and return representatives to the following steps as soon as we have the assurance.
Thanks to the APP team for taking the lead in this.
Office status, description, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF personnel may be exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
Because of great concern, however, we have sent a clean - up crew to remove bacteria from all parts of the San Francisco office.
Use the poison - medicine soap to remove germs everywhere, as well as the reception area and the evangelists entering our area.
The building uses its administrative software using products that support the safety of its continents.
We feel free that the office will be right when we decide to go back.
Our DC office is in Werk, which assigned us its COVID-19 government as well as all the DC workers.
Since the past week, our DC office has moved to a remote area completely loaded in harmony with the guidance provided by San Francisco.
As some of our NYC workers knew, we had been discussing renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions persist but may take time.
Some of our fellow workers were working far away for the first time.
Our longtime employees know that it may be a great change, and they want to give you some advice:
Reduce the length of the meetings to at least one or two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, consider how you can separate them within a few days.
Make it clear that the meeting is about you, be flexible, and forward to the things that must be learned in advance.
Do this with video equipment, such as Google Docs and Zoos, so that you can work and communicate with each other.

The HR Office seeks the guidance of the Internet agencies by effective operating methods to support the expansion of the work that is being sent to the rest of the company.
This past week we asked all who received the social pensions to announce the social events supported by Wikimedia, such as the Ideitons, WHO until he announced the end of the epidemic.
We will tell them that we have come to realize that our request for help and other limitations may not be as strong as it might be — that no one will be repaid for drinking or for changing jobs.
In the following week we will follow further direction to Wikimania and other public and provincial and regional institutions.
The general feeling of the world’s population seems to be to be disappointed with the disorder but to be relieved by the explanation and opportunities to focus on their communities, Wikimedia, and so forth.
In time, CRTC works to insert a page from Meta-Wiki so that it can be given a public space to see the impact that has been present and to follow our conversations with them.
To stay connected with issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar next Thursday, at 14:0 UTC/07:00 PT for a special labor assembly.
We will use this time to share some thoughts with others, answer your questions, and spend some time with each other.
We work together, and we will help you wherever you are.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive information in this mail, along with all the other vital information of COVID-19 related toOffice Wiki.
CRTC will keep these pages sorted and all information in the same location.
We also work to keep regular contact with workers living in lands currently deeply affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, main work route, service challenge, and anything else you may need, please be willing to tell you and work with CRTC.
We are here to help support and communicate when needed.
If you have a confidential or serious matter, please send an e - mail to Bryan Juda - Director of the HR International Global Applications.
None of these changes should be considered a mark of neglecting work and our obligations.
Rather, they are aware that at this time, our work and obligations will likely have to be completed in an unprecedented way.
These measures, which are believed to be necessary in order to support one another in order to continue our work, to give our group the support that they need, and to the world to which you depend.
The work we plan to do will be waiting for us when the time comes.
In the meantime, it is a time for mutual support and space for an important activity that may take place in the weeks and months to come.
We need all of you to do that, so we need all of you to care for you and your families so that you can be fully prepared when the need arises.
Now, we beg you -- stretch out your hands and don’t touch your face!

The B'Angiotsin-conning enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an external enzyme (in the cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, muscles, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 combats the operation of angiotsian-conning enzymes (ACE) by reducing the number of Angiotsan-II and raising an Ag(1-7) and making it a promising drug for heart and blood diseases. ACE2 also serves as a place to enter cells in certain coronavirus cells.
The human enzyme type is usually referred to as hACE2.
Angiotsian-conning enzyme 2 is metalloenzyme, which is on the face of endotolial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains N-terminal-terminal keys M2 and C-terminal co-completrin replace amino acid  Transporter.
ACE2 is a single - line membrane unit with its enzymes exposed to the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The inner cell of ACE2 is separated from the transmmbrane in the enzyme known as shedres, and the decompressed protein is then pumped out of the blood and eventually out of the urine.
ACE2 is present in many body components: ACE2 is linked to the cell cell primarily with the cell cell’s second cell of all kinds of cells, entrerocytes of smaller cells, arterial and venous cells in many cells.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in crebral cortex, stritum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as the ACE secretary.
ACE distinguishes angiotsan I hormone into varoctring antalin II.
ACE2 separates carxyl-requestnonocid phelinine from angiotlanian II (Isp-Arg-Val-Tyl-Tyr-Tyr-HI-Pr-Pro-Per) and separates it into a vasdillatator iotsian (1-7), (H-Assp-Pal-Al-Tyr-Tyr-HI-Pro-H).
ACE2 can also distinguish a number of other papyri, including [des-Arg9] bradykinin, apelin, neuroterin, Dynophin A, and highlin.
The ACE2 also manages the movement of the netral amino acid transferer SLC6A19 and is linked to Hartnup's disease.
As with transmmbrane, ACE2 serves as the primary entrance to certain coronavirus cells, which include HCV-NL63; SARS-CV (SARS virus); and SARS-CV-2 (CVIV-19).
Pointedly, the combination of SARS-COV and SARS-CV2 protein enzyme on the face of the cells results in endocytosis and the movement of both bacteria and enzymes to endosomes.
This procedure of entry also requires making Sprotein function of the prostate TMPRS2, a barrier under current tests as a cure for disease. This has led some to conclude that reducing the risk of ACE2 radiation in cells, can help fight infection.
However, many leading organizations and active bodies have encouraged a normal ACE vaccine and treatment of ARB.
"Reformation and analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "" operating ACE vaccines was associated with a 34% greater risk of pneumonia compared with the controls."
"On the other hand," the problem of pneumonia has been reduced to patients treated with ACE vaccines that have been at greater risk for pneumonia, particularly those of stroke and heart disease."
"The use of ACE vaccines has also been linked to the reduction of patients dying from pneumonia, although the effects were less serious than the damage that pneumonia can cause."
A combination of human combinations ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a new treatment for severe lung injury, and it seems to promote pulmonary hedynamics oxygen releases from the ppopolysasacarride-ind acupte respiratory stress syndrome.
Part of the hyACE2 of people takes 10 hours to work and starts working after 30 minutes more than your working time (time) for 24 hours.
Some studies indicate that rACE2 can be a suitable drug for those who cannot drink RAS inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases when angiotsin II is active. The completion of rhACE2 has been diagnosed in a medical research for treating a respiration of stress syndrome.
"App-b 'COVID-19" software programs are designed to help you get numbers in terms of the 2019-20 connavirus epidemic, as a means of contacting people (") that they may have had contact with an infected person."
Several programs have been developed or contemplated, with the cooperation of government legislation in some places.
There have been developed applications to build the amphibians to search for the affected ones.
Secret concerns have been voiced, especially with regard to masts based on the following location of the amp.
Other methods that do not require confidential information include the use of Bluetooth crystals to replace the user’s position in other youths.
On April 10, 2020, the Google and the Apple announced that they would build a way to support such applications in Bluetooth directly on the OS in Andoroid and OS.
In China, the Chinese government, working with the Alipay, has established an ap which allows citizens to check whether they have been contacted with COVID-19 people.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, a tap is used as TraceTogther.
"This application was established for local IT workers, released as an open seed and will be given to the government. In North Macedonia it was issued "Stop Korona!"", "Ap operating with Bluetooth to pursue a description of people who may be infected and given prompt response to health authorities."
The apply was established by the Department of Communications and Technology and by the Department of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the apply was expected to be authorized by the Google Plain Store and ApppSer.
"On 12 April, the government said that the search for man was at a advanced stage of development, and it was to be available to be released in a few weeks. Similar apply to Ireland, and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand consider theaps based on Singapore’s Trace Tace Togother and Blue Grace protocol. Russia has intended to establish an icon which is displayed when one crosses the limits set for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they are not displaced.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at Cambridge University, lists several factors that can be a problem with apricots, which include misleading warnings and chances of not receiving a warning if the apply is limited to a small number of people.
"To resolve the problems associated with the ap "e-coronavirus" that is misleading or dangerous, the Apple set limits on the types of organizations that can insert connavirus into its Approvirus, said it would be only those of "custom" or trusted organizations."
Google and Amazon have established similar limits.
Secret partners express their concern about the problems of mass exploration using connavirus scanners, especially about whether the coronavirus program is designed to deal with the connavirus epidemic will be closed after the attack has passed.
The Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement that limits this type of search.
These organizations have established nine subjects in government institutions:
"A search should be" lawful, required and appropriate""""
the development of the period of awareness and exploration should be subject to sunsets;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
the protection of the net and lack of names will have to be protected and shown as a defense based on evidence;
a biopsy should avoid lowering the risk of prejudice and reducing the value of property;
Whatever sharing the ashes with other men shall be required according to the law:
there should be caution against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
"A valuable sharing is all of the "" participants" will be required, which includes public health professionals and small groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohne Gshan) also produce test lists.
A proposed Google/Applet program intended to correct the recurring sequence problem by removing the search work from the OS mailing list when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries that have used a network - based search is more than apricots, which eliminate both the need to navigate the applet and avoid following.
In Israel, a network - based sequence was authorized.
Network - based solutions that can reach the depths of the undivided area can present serious privacy problems.
However, not all masts have large servers to get to reach the pool of one’s property; the number of codes that have been built using large servers only to communicate (see below).
In South Korea, an amp was used for a man's tracking.
Instead of using a standard amp, the plant collects the search information from various sources that includes a table to track a young buoy and a credit card card, and includes this in order to send notices by text messages to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this information to warn people who might be infected, the government has also made local knowledge available to the public, which is approved for many changes in privacy after the MERS outbreaks of the country.
This knowledge is available to the public with amputees and satellites. The countries involved in Germany have considered using both large physicss and those that protect privacy.
Since April 6, 2020, details have not been published.
An attempt to protect privacy is a well designed method, with many research books from at least 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than 12 teams of experts have been looking for solutions for privacy, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to draw the user closer to other young people.
However, the PPP-PT is an attempt to connect which contains both large and wide variety of ways, and is not a single proposory. Various protocols include Decentralid Privary-Preserving Proximity Traping (DPPPT/PPPP-3T), TMPDN Concattattatt Every Number, CEN, Pharmacologists and Mechanisms for Motatt Trancing Training (T).
In these protrusions, man’s visible net never leaves the diaphragm, and all the cooperation comes to an abrupt end.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been establishing the Safe Pats, a platform to use privacy precautions when gathering and using a space or a table as a guide route to follow the COVID-19 explosion.
"Based on the white page" Apps Gone Rogue: Manitating Personal Privacy in an Epidemiic" published in March 2020. One similar effort is the Sfefetrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that established secret technology for the first time in MIT Media Tab.
The SafeTrace uses secure technology to allow users to share the serious environmental and health of the environment with other users and the law, without endangering the privacy of the property.
On April 5, 2020, the international TCN Coalition was formed by groups associated with what had been the very different means, with the aim of reducing the divisions, and the universal use of the amphibians to search and warn, an important factor in general acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that he had issued an invitation for the BlueTrace government minister to use by its official governmentap.
On April 10, 2020, the Google and the Apple, the companies that control the small platforms of Andreid and OS, announced the way of searching people, and asserted that they would protect privacy, based on the Bluefoot Low Energy and cryptography technology.
They also print the technical features used in the movie industry.
In accordance with the Apple and Google, the System is intended to be removed in three categories:
To enable governments to build a legal application of coronavirus to protect privacy
A direct introduction to the OS and Andid Google and the Apple order to correct the ongoing problems of starting and monitoring by sending the screen first with OS's replacements, and later releasing it in the same way after the threat has passed.
The drug repositioning (also known as re-use of a tree, re-profiling, re-marking or perpeulic switching) is to reuse a prescribed drug to cure a different disease or a different health condition.
This is a form of scientific research currently being done to develop safe and effective methods of COVID - 19.
Other research guidelines include the development of the COVID-19 goals and the use of a compact blood plasma. SARS-CV-2 have about 66 proteins capable of using a tree, each with a number of satellites.
A review of the sites in which they are included created a reasonable program to develop a drug that is resistant to COVID-19.
Of the most important profiles of SARS-CV-2 are proteas, RNA polymerase based on RNA, herlicas, Sprotein, and ADP rophastase.
Husssel A, and others have studied a number of drugs that can be used and that have been developed and analyzed the similarities in its structure with the same high - standard high drug combinations in order to speed up the development of a powerful SAS-CV-2 drug in this pre-CV-2 treatment treatment that can be used as a laboratory.

The aim of the A COVID-19 is an estimated goal against Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease.
Although no goal of medical research has yet been achieved, there are many continuing efforts to develop such a goal.
Toward the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it was not expected that the goal of SARS-CV-2, the virus, is the cause, to be found less than 18 months.
Five State Security Surveys in April.
The COVID-19 received on December 2019.
The greatest explosion in the world took place in 2020, leading to an enormous financial and research project for the development of a goal.
Most organizations use genes to establish the goals of SARS-CV-2.
Since April, the key features of CEPI’s mission are fast, cut down, produced, and reached on earth.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technical platforms had been studied and developed in early 2020 to form a practical goal against COVID-19.
The main platform operations that developed in class security research I include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (the founder of the Class I and the target card: Moderna, MMRNA 1927)
anviral verector (Centroporial I and target conference: Can Sinno Biologiecs, adenovirus type 5 perctor)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 110 cents in the early stages of the development of the goal, 78 are confirmed as infected software (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 are announced, but very little of the public knowledge available (which may be planned or developed).
The IEI Programme study tests the safety of prior to the use and fighting of the virus, usually planned, controlled by explosives, and in many institutions, while monitoring more accurate, effective levels.
The study of Part III usually involves more volunteers, which include a control team, and the operation of a diagnosis to prevent disease, while serious results are being achieved with proper doses.

In March 2020, the government, industry, and three US universities combine equipment to obtain IBM computers, combined with air computers from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Other goals have a bearing on the effects of other living things, which are also called vague.
That means they can have far - reaching effects for the disease they prevent.
One informal survey in Australia wants to register 4,1700 health workers.
Goals may not be safe or effective.
The first study of the effectiveness of a goal is used by animal models in COVID-19, such as the ACE2 infected mouse, some laboratory animals, and humans, showing the need for protection against the 3 virus in handling germs, and dealing with other countries to ensure safe processes that work around the world.
The goals of SARS and MERS have been studied in models of nonhuman beings.
Since 2020, there has not been any known anti-SARS safety strategy that has proved to be safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of new goals and medicines in treating SARS was a major factor in government and public health services worldwide. And there is no established goal for MERS.
When MERS became active, it was believed that current SARS research could provide a valuable clinic for developing goals and treatment methods for MERS-CV virus.
Since March 2020, there has been one goal (DNA) of the MERS that completed a class of public medical research, and the other three are still being studied, and all are the goals of active-vectors, adenoviral-vectors (ChADOx1-MERS, BBC-GamVac), two, and one MVA-MARS-vector (MARS-S-S).
Police stations promote the idea that the virus causing COVID-19 is known and that the goal is already being reached.
The accounts quoted in various chat rooms refer to the already existing genetic lists and the goals of other coronavirus relatives such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious virus caused by a sere respiratory system system unit 2 (SARS-CV-2).
Symptoms of general illness include fever, cough, and cough.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throats, odors, and stomach pain.
The time from the onset of symptoms is usually five days but from two to fourteen days.
While most conditions result in the symptoms of disease, others result in increased pneumonia and multiple sclerosis.
Since 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in countries and areas, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people in contact with, usually with tiny droplets that come out when you cough, sneeze, or speak.
Although these bumps leave when breathing, they often fall on the ground or other objects rather than into bacteria in long distances.
People may also be infected with the virus and touch its eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive in nutrients for about 72 hours.
It is most common during the first three days after the onset of symptoms of the disease, although it can develop before the outbreak of symptoms and later stages of the virus. The usual method of testing is respiration polymerase chan (RT-PCR) by the liver.
The use of masks is encouraged by those who suspect that they have the virus and their caregivers.
The suggestion that the whole community use a mask is different, some authorities say that it is not used, some say that it was not used, and others require that it be used.
At present, there is no specific goal or treatment against COVID-19.
The transmission of the virus has been found in many countries in all six areas of WHO.
Those infected may have no symptoms or symptoms such as fever, colds, fatigue, and asthma.
Signs of emergency disease include difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty in awakening, and facial and mouth as soon as these symptoms appear.
Strange as it may seem, the symptoms that affect breathing above may appear to be intermittent, such as sneezing, fluores, or throat.
Symptoms of the disease in the mouth from the mouth to the thighs such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been seen by various percent.
Some incidents in China first caused only the intensity of the heart and the intensity of the heart.
In others, the disease can develop into pneumonia, kill many organs, and kill.
This is also called the age of outbreaks of symptoms.
The period of symptoms of COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms develop during 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected cases have symptoms.
The role of these who do not have symptoms in transmitting to others is not fully understood; however, current evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The number of infected people who do not show symptoms of the disease is now known and underestimating, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected people have had no symptoms during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include cases of disease in its daily numbers on April 1; of 166 infected on that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms during the test.
Both the cough and the saliva can affect the virus.
Freeness of speech takes more words than mere words.
Research in Singapore has found that coughing without covering can lead to a distance of about 15 feet [4.5 m] (15 m).
Although the virus is usually not transmitted into the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it can be passed on by breathing and air stations in the lungs outside the rooms of people have released a thick layer of RNA virus.
Certain medical procedures, such as tube and cariopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the production of particles to be released from the air and result in the explosion of breathing.
While there is concern that it can be spread out, this risk is thought to be small: A virus is more common when people have symptoms; although increase may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is less.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet fully clear how easy it is to spread the virus, one person is usually infected with two or three people. The virus lives for hours to days in things.
In particular, the virus was found to be a single day on a map, about three days in plastic (polypropylene) and steel (AII 304), and about four hours in 99%.
This, however, varies from temperature to temperature.
The soap can also serve when used properly; soap products reduce the protective membranes of the virus, kill it, and remove it from the skin and elsewhere.
Some soaps, such as babalconium chloride and chlorophydine gluconate, are not effective. In Hong Kong research, test samples are taken two days after they start to be admitted to the hospital.
Of five of the six patients, the first sample showed the high level of the virus, and the sixth patient showed the high level of the virus on the second day.
The endere aute respiratory unit coronavirus 2 (SARS-CV-2) is a very serious respiratory system system system system system system, starting with the removal of three persons with multiple pneumonias in Wuhan.
All aspects of the new SARS-CV-2 virus are from coronavirus.
While outside the human body, the virus is killed by the home soap, which explodes its protective shell. SARS-CV-2 closely associated with SAERS-CV.
The lungs are very sensitive to COVID-19 because the virus enters the main cells through the enzymes called angiotsian-conning enzyme 2 (ACE2), which are widely available in the second type of alcohol cells in the lungs.
"The bug uses a special glycoprotein called "spike" (peplomer) to contact ACE2 and enter the main cell."
The worst heart damage was found in 12% of infected people who were admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more likely to occur in serious diseases.
The symptoms of high cardiovascular disease, which cause tumors and immune infections during the growth of the disease, but serious heart attacks may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are very visible in the heart and are involved in heart function.
The case of throphorosis (31%) and venous throeboelism (25%) is found in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be related to weak prognosis. The preparation of people killed by COVID-19 has shown Diffuse alcohol (DAD), and lymphocyte in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a hormone hormone for ACE2-expressing breathing, patients with COVID-19 are critical symptoms of systeminic hyporflamma.
In particular, the ophthogenic GM-CSF-seding T-cells seem to correspond to the discovery of IL-6-sreating times and the causes of serious illness in the lungs of COVID-19 patients.
There have also been reports of lymphocytic infiltates during automation.
WHO has published a number of programs for screening the virus.
A common method of testing is the transverse process of polymerase (rRT-PCR).
Tests are usually made on breathing samples that are found in a tube; however, an acupunctur or sputum tube can also be used.
The results usually occur within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but this requires two blood samples taken within two weeks and the results have little value at that time.
Chinese scientists have been able to divide part of the coronavirus and print a sequence of nutrients so that viruses around the world can develop a polymerase scan (PCR) screen for infection.
Since April 4, 2020, tests on the properties of the disease (which can detect active viruses and if one has already had a virus) have been developed, but it has not been widely used.
The findings of Chinese studies show that the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first medical examination on March 21, 2020 used at the end of that month. Research guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested ways to detect the virus based on medical factors and the risk of control of disease control.
Bilteral multibar-grand-Glass spread by peripheral, asymmetric, and posterios are common in infection.
Subbleulal dominance, crazy paring (the feverr shock with avarian alveolalling), and consulitation may appear as the disease progresses.
Small data available from microscopic loons and cryophophyology of COVID-19.
The key factors found in surveys are:
Microscopy:pu safe, Percardis, lungcontion and epulmonary edema
Four types of pneumonia virus can be identified:
common pneumonia: pulmonary odema, pneucyte hyperplasia, carge atypical pneumonia, Interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infultation and multi-multired cell content
critical hydraulic: biscuse alcohol; DAD) and Diffuse alveolattes.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) and hypoxemia.
lost hydrates: combination of edodites on alveolar cavites and pulmonary interstial fibrosis
Blood: disergend intranscular direction (DIC); leukorythroblastic reaction
Steps to reduce the risk of infection include staying in the house, avoiding crowded areas, washing hands and hands often for about 20 seconds, practicing oral and nose hygiene, and avoiding eye, nose, or mouth loss.
The CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with a tube when coughing or sneezeing and encourages using the inner earring when the spam is not present.
Proper hand washing after cough or sneeze is encouraged.
The CDC promotes the use of face - to - face mask cloth when in public, in part to reduce infection from people who do not have symptoms. Social contact with people who are infected with the virus is intended to reduce contact with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, preventing travel and setting up large conventions.
Guidelines also include that people remain at least 6 knots (1.8 m).
"No known tree works to prevent COVID-19. Since the goal is not expected until 1921 at least, the best way to control COVID-19 to try to reduce the number of those with the virus, called "You make the line flat"."
The CDC also encourages people to wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands seem dirty, before and after breakfast, coughing, and sneezing.
It also encourages the use of an alcohol - hand tractor at least 60%, but only if soap and water are not readily available. In places where hand tires are not easily available, WHO provides two methods for producing them in the area.
In these ways, an antimicrobial function is from ethanol or sopropanol.
"Hydroxide is used to help eliminate bacteria from alcohol; "It's not a virus in handwashol"."
Glycerol is inserted to form moisture.
People are treated with care, which may include blood treatment, oxygen treatment, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those who are suspected of being infected wear a normal face mask.
ECMO is used to solve the respiratory problem, but its benefits are still considered.
Sanitation, life, and wholesome food have been promoted to prevent infection.
Health - support treatments may help those with the symptoms of a recent infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for treating COVID-19 patients.
Innovists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have included treatment methods from various sources from free source, IBC.
Since April 2020, there has been no available treatment for COVID-19.
When symptoms appear, some doctors recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than bubprofen.
Measures must be taken to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to another, especially in medical centers where procedures may be performed that may produce aerosols, such as intuits or contact valves.
For doctors caring for COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping a person in Airborn Protection — AIR (AIR) rather than using normal measures, preventing contact and inflammatory exposure. The CDC explains the use of positive processes (PPPPPPE) during the epidemic.
The requirements: PPPPE, a cursor or face mask, an eyeguard, and a medical glove. When found, satellites (in place of facial masks) are encouraged.
N95 respirors are authorized to be used in factories but FDA has authorized the masks to be used under the Emergency Use of Administration (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air as dust, but the protection of a particular body unit is not guaranteed in its use.
If masks are not available, the CDC suggests to use fo'c'ses or, if there is no other way, automatic masks.
Most features of the COVID-19 are not too bad to require mechanical content or other methods, but some need it.
The form of breathing support for people with a respiratory disorder related to COVID-19 is still being studied in the hospital, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided with high fever and sal cannnula or bi-level conditionive pressure.
Whether these two leads to the same outcome in the case of people who are seriously ill is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to live with invasive metastasis if it is available because this method reduces the spread of smell crystals compared with the high flu and sal cannola. The worst conditions are common among adults (more than 60, especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds, which reduce the number of people are caused by a failure to manage an unexpected rise in the number of people with critical COVID-19 in need of hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% were hospitalized, 2.3% required venerable treatment, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the people in a hospital with a COVID-19 end up being admitted to the ICU.
Ventilation machines become more complex as acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) forms in COVID-19 and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators with stress - control systems and high PEEP are required to increase oxygen supply while reducing the risk of lung damage related to vetilator and pneuthorax.
PEEP may not be found in old ventilators.
Medical research began in January 2020, and a number of antiviral drugs were developed in medical research.
Remdesir seems to be the most effective one.
Although 202 are still developed new medicines, several of the drugs tested have already been approved for another use or already advanced tests.
Antiviral drugs can be tried for people with a serious virus.
WHO encourages volunteers to assist in medical research that can be used to treat drugs for a time. FDA has temporarily authorized cryptographic plasma as a research therapy in cases where one is already seriously affected.
It has not yet been in the medical research needed to prove it safe and effective in treating disease.
In February 2020, a young apple was established in China to manage the outbreak of the virus.
Users requested to enter the name and ID of the ID.
This applet is able to see 'if you are close to someone' using a search needle that could be dangerous to infection.
All users can take note of the condition of the other three users.
If a potentially dangerous situation appears to be, the ap not only encourages isolation from people, but also warns health authorities. The analysis of many of the chart through the youth’s tablet, visual awareness technology, youth sequences and development information is used to transport infected and infected people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to follow up on a youthful telephone network that is thought to have coronavirus.
This is done to keep them separate from the community and to protect those who may be contacting infected residents.
In March 2020, the Deutsche Tekelem shared the plot of the telephone area with the German government's guide, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia developed the ability to observe face - to - face in order to find violators of social separation rules.
"The Italian health officer Giulio Galera said he was told to the young workers that "40% of the people continue to move."
The German government was running a 48-hour computer game for the 42,000 recruits.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a national declaration of resolutions to prevent the outbreak of the cronavirus.
People may face the stress of isolation, being restricted, the side effects of treatment, or the fear of infection itself.
"BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "The ongoing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety about health, depression and economic collapse is a hurricane that affects people’s minds and their wells."
The virus may have little or no symptoms, resulting in some common respiratory infections like normal colds.
Normal conditions have been cured within two weeks, while those infected with a severe or serious virus can take from three to six weeks to heal.
Women who are pregnant may be at greater risk of COVID - 19 based on exposure from other similar bacteria, such as SARS and MERS, but the net of COVID-19 is lacking. For some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
For those who are most affected, COVID-19 can soon develop a respiratory disorder (ARDS) that causes damage to the respiratory tract, septic shock or death of most organs.
The problems associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal cream and heart damage, kidney and liver.
Clotting anomials, particularly the increase in prothrobin time, are found at 6% of those admitted to the hospital for COVID-19, whereas kidney loss is shown in 4% of the group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show high levels of liver enzymes (trannaminas).
According to the same report, the average time between the initial symptoms of disease and death is ten days, and five are spent in the hospital.
However, patients transferred to ICU have about seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early study of conditions, the average time from the initial symptoms of disease to death was 14 days, a total of 6 to 41 days.
In a study of the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the death rate is 2.8% while the mortality rate is 1.7%.
Hhistopathologicals are experiments for automated lung examinations that indicate the sinus alveolar mage and cellular fibromyxoids in both lungs.
The change of vilal cytopathic was seen in pneuccytes.
The film showed acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart damage was noted in high levels of troponin or heart position.
According to March date from the United States, 9% of those admitted to the hospital were already sick. The discovery of medical and economic factors affecting the community may contribute to the death of people.
Estimates of human death due to a virus vary because of such differences in the region but also because of difficulties in methods used.
The fewer cases of extreme adverse conditions may cause the death rate to exceed expected.
However, the fact that death is the result of previously infected conditions can mean that the mortality rate is now low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to receive symptoms of COVID - 19 and are more than 2.4 times more likely to receive emergency care or death compared with people who do not smoke. Anxiety has been caused by long - term diseases before the virus.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority has gained 20% to 30% from lung function in other people who have been exposed to infection, and lung scans indicate that they may be injured.
This can also lead to postpartum depression after recovery.
In March 2020, it was not known that the previous virus can help to provide effective and long - term protection to people who are recovering from the virus.
The resistance to the virus seems to be possible, based on other coronavirus, but it has been reported that the recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by a brief coronavirus tests later.
These conditions are thought to be an epidemic rather than a new infection.
The virus is thought to be both natural and biological, and it has entered human society.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the virus was almost fully led by the transmission of it from man to man.
A survey of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in Lancet, indicated that the first day for outbreaks of the disease was December 1, 2019.
The official documents of WHO reported that the symptoms of the first disease were actually on December 8, 2019.
Several methods of counting death are used extensively.
These figures vary from region to region and from time to time and depending on the level of test, the frequency of medical examinations, treatment procedures, time from the first appearance and characteristics of people, such as age, sex, and health.
Toward the end of 1920, WHO distributed emergency documents at ICD-10, U.N.1 killed by a reputable SARS-CV-2 virus and U02 U.S.2 was killed by COVID-19 equipped with medical-devitation without the valid SARS-CV-2 virus. The number of deaths than the virus indicates the number of deaths that were affected during the given time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the number of deaths worldwide is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) on April 1720.
The number varies from region to region. Other ways include case factorraterate (CFR), which shows percent of screened deaths, and infesion factorrate (IFR), which represents a percentage of people who are infected (iFR) who are infected with the virus.
These figures are not based on time and follow the number of people from the infection infection to the remedy.
While not all infected ones are infected with the virus, the presence of the virus can provide information on how many people have the virus.
In a high - risk area in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small area of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) are already dead.
In the Gingel, the virus was aggravated by Carnival gatherings, and it entered into young people, causing lower mortality, and not all of them died from COVID-19 who were officially recognized as infected.
In addition, the German health industry has not yet had high prices.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may be infected, as blood donors have studied.
69 (0.004% of the number of people) are convinced that they have been killed by COVID-19.
The ravages of the epidemic and the mortality rate vary from men and women to women.
Death rates are higher than men in research conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is by the age of 50, and the gap between men and women is close to 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The main reasons for this difference are unknown, but genetic factors and behavior may be a factor.
The gender - based range of infected ones, the low percentage of smokers in women and men who develop certain diseases such as hypertension at a younger age than women may contribute to a higher number of men dying.
In Europe, 57% of men are infected by men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were males.
In April 2020, the US government does not follow the sex statistics of COVID-19.
Studies show that men and women are affected in different ways, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have many opportunities to be exposed to the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the virus will be "COVID-19".
WHO’s prime minister, Tedros Adamo Ghebreyus, explained that CO represents corona, VI stands for Virus, D represents the disese, and 19 for the year marked by the first outbreaks: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen so as not to be named a specific area (such as China), animal species or group of people, in harmony with the proposals of various countries intended to prevent racism. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the sere arcety system unit connavirus 2 (SARS-CV-2).
"WHO also use "COVID-19" and "COVID-19" virus which causes COVID-19" in public chats."
"Both disease and infection are commonly called "coronavirus"."
"During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "the Wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, WHO suggested that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCov anthote respiratory disease as terms to be used with the virus and disease in accordance with 2015 guidelines against the use of place in the names of disease and germs.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CV-2 are issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of the lack of goods in the production industry, some producers have printed medical facilities such as moths and vetilators.
For example, when the Italian hospital urgently needed an vetilator valve, and the surgeon could not send it at the time required, the local company used its own machines and recorded 100valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, suspected news, false and misleading news came about the origin, increase, ban, treatment, and other factors of the disease and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to pass the virus on to other animals.
Research has failed to prove the link between pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no known cure or effective treatment for the disease.
International research into the goals and medicines of COVID - 19 is being conducted by government agencies, schools and industrial research groups.
"By March, the World Health Organization began "FEARNED Research" to study the results of the treatment of four drugs against the existing virus with great hopes of working."
There is no vaccine available, but various vaccines work to establish vaccines.
The past function of SARS-CV is used because SARS-COV and SARS-CV-2 both use ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three methods of prevention are studied.
First, the researchers intended to develop a vaccine.
The objective of the use of a virus such as this, inactive or dead, is to initiate a body response against a new COVID-19 virus.
The second method, subunit vancines, is intended to establish a goal that allows the immune system to respond to certain aspects of the virus.
If it is SARS-CV-2, such research focuses on S-spike-poke-poke-poke-in-to-A-acme receptor.
The third option is nucleic acid goals (DNA goals or RNA, a new method for setting a goal).
The goals that are studied in any of these methods should be considered safe and functioning. On March 16, 2020, the first medical study of this goal began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The goal contains a genetic code that is not secure in copying into the disease - causing virus. Advances based on the properties of the disease have been proposed as a challenge to the establishment of SARS-COV-2 goal, but this is not guaranteed.
There are more than 300 medical research that has continued since April 2020.
Seven studies have been studying the already authorized treatment of malaria, which involves the fourth study of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Recombinant antibiotics make up much of the research in China, and the ninth study of the so - called remdesiver section of residual respiration in several countries will send a report toward the end of April.
A powerful recombination of the medical goal of COVID-19 and non-use drugs for treatment had begun, in April 2020. Several available antibiotics are studied in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesirist, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, plopavir/rinavir/rvir/rinavir.
There was valid evidence of remsilitation, March 2020.
It has been seen the progress in the treatment of patients that is seen in the use of remsidavir.
The medical research of Type III is conducted in US, China, and Italy. chloroquine, formerly used in treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with unauthorized results.
However, research results are being proposed.
Korean and China Health authorities recommend chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virginology, while encouraging the daily average of one gram, notes that the amount is twice as high and can be deadly.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued permission to be used in emergency situations of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the sight of doctors who treated people with COVID-19. The 7 guidelines for China's program included interferron, ribabin or umifinovir in the COVID-19 treatment.
An unauthorized data indicates that high ribarin levels are necessary to prevent SARS-CV-2 from invitro.
Nyzozoxide has been suggested in a continuous video research after showing the inactive ban on SARS-CV-2. Research shows that the first rise of protein priming by the transsmbranse protease sermise 2 (TMPRSS2) is particularly significant in the entry of SARS-CV-2 by related to ACE2.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine along with azithromycin or without it have considerable restrictions on the medical community in finding this treatment without continuing research. Oselmatavir does not prevent SARS-CV-2 from thevitor and has an unknown role in treating COVID-19.
The Cytokine signalm may be a problem in the later stages of COVID-19 very bad.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have the properties of anti-cytokine storum. Tocicizumab has been added to medical guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a brief investigation.
A study of section 2 which is not organized in the national part of Italy was conducted after showing the overall effects for people with a serious illness.
Together with a blood test of serum ferit in order to find cytokines, it is intended to prevent this, which is thought to be the cause of some victims.
The Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was authorized by the FDA based on previous research in treating steroid cytone syndrome caused by different factors, CAR T therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no unorganized, controlled evidence that toyumib is effective CRS therapy.
The passing of contaminated and powerful antibodies from those who are recovered from COVID-19 to the people who need them is considered to be a means that does not require limited immunity.
This procedure was tried on SARS and the results were unknown.
viral and inpution is the expected method used when low - dose treatment can create protection against SARS-CV-2.
However, other methods, such as cellular cytotoxicity based on the properties of disease and/or paragocytotosis, may be possible.
Other methods of treating the elements of the disease, for example, are developed.
The production of calcium serum, which contains a blood fraction from patients who have recovered and who have the antibodies associated with the virus, can be removed for immediate use.
Coronavirus, group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, who later became infected and died from COVID-19 after helping to monitor the spread of the virus.
