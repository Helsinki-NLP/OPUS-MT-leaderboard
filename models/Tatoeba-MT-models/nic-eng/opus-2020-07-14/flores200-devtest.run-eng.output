When a small group of living creatures (a few species) are separated from their primary group (such as a mountain or a river) or when moving to another island that is difficult to come back), they often live in different places.
The area is new, with different characteristics and characteristics of the original living organisms. These new living organisms need new or timely parts to be better managed to meet existing conditions than they were previously needed.
The original life - style has not changed completely, nor does any of the other physical changes need to be made.

Ecology is a term that actually contains many ideas, from the idea that technology brings new tools or that technology must accept them, even to the point that the future of man’s destiny is closely related to scientific principles, which he is then linked to the design of modern technology.
Many definitions of biology consist of two general arguments: that the development of technology itself goes far beyond cultural and political factors, and that science also affects the ‘ effect ’ on society, not from various social factors.
For example, one might say that driving leads to road progress.
