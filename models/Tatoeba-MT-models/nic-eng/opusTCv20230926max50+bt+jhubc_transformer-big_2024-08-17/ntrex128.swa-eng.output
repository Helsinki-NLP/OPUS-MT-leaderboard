Welsh Council delegates are worried about 'looking like puppets'
There are concerns among some delegates after the proposal that their position should be changed to the MWP (Minister of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to a plan to change the name of the council to the Parliament of Wales.
Council delegates from all political circles are concerned that the move will cause sarcasm.
One Leba delegate said that his group was concerned that the name "compared to Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means fool and pwp means feces.
A spokeswoman for Plaid said that the group as a whole is "not happy" and has proposed an alternative name.
A conservative delegate said his group was "thinking in ideas" about the name change, but said they were words of the MWP abbreviation to the puppeteer.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced the same as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Board panel, which is currently creating legislation to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision on any key word regarding how the Board's Commissioners are referred to will surely belong to the delegates themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh council the authority to change its name.
In June, Jopo published the results of a public consultation on proposals that were broadly supported by reference to the council as the Parliament of Wales.
In relation to the position of Council Commissioners, the Jopo preferred the Welsh Parliamentary Delegate or WMP, but the MWP option received further support in consultation with the public.
Apparently, the Council's Commissioners propose an alternative option, but efforts to reach an agreement can be a challenge for the Executive Officer, Elin Jones, orbye is expected to submit a draft of legislation on changes within weeks.
The law on changes will include other changes to how the council works, including laws to remove the dignity of the Commissioner of the Council and the structure of the committee system.
The delegates of the Council will cast a final vote on what name they will be called when they are discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote for a referendum on changing the country's name
<0x56>oters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the country name to "North Macedonia."
This popular vote was organized to resolve a decade-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has a region called Macedonia.
The authority in the city of Athens maintains that the name of neighbouring countries in the north represents a claim for their territory and has continued to challenge its request for membership in the European Union and the NATO Union.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the direct referendum on the change of name, has said he will ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say a change of name is necessary so that they can join the EU and the NATO Union.
St. Martin's Goes Silent as Churches in Harlem Pass Chagamoto
"Historically, the elders with whom I have spoken say that there was a church and a bar in every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there's none."
He said the absence of a bar is understandable.
"People wander differently" these days, he said.
"They're reluctant to be like a neighbor's lobby where people meet from time to time."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money available from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders expect them as well, "and they will soon return to their original condition."
Churches, he added, may be converted into large flats with privately owned houses that will not help maintain the remaining reserves in the surrounding area.
"A large number of people who are buying private homes in these whips will be white," he said, "and so this situation will expedite the closure of these churches as a whole because there is no chance that people in these ghettos will be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white allies before Harlem became a black city - the City Community in 1870 and was named St. Martin a decade later.
Traditionally White Methodist members left in the 1930s.
Members who were black who were sharing the surrounding area took whips.
St. Martin came under black associates under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a strike by retailers at 125th Street, the main street for purchase in Harlem, who refused to hire or cooperate with blacks.
The resulting fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but when collaborators in Priest Johnson's church put up plans to rebuild it, they gave authority for the establishment of a set of bells played using a keyboard or an otomatic technique.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Priest Johnson and heir of St. Martin, called the set of bells "the bells of the poor."
An expert who played a set of bells in July called it another name: "the cultural fund" and "an irreversible historical issue."
Professionally, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also realized that it was the world's first bell set that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved into the area of the largest set at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not seek someone else to take his place.
The bells that have been played in St. Martin over the past several months have been played by architects and contractors in a complicated manner, some of whom were brought in by church leaders, and some by the diocese of the Bishopric.
An administrative council in the parish, consisting of church administrators – wrote to the diocese in July concerned that the diocese "had a plan to transfer costs" to the council, even though the council had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors who were sent by the diocese.
Some allies complained of the absence of transparency from the diocese.
Pope injures 13-year-old child while diving to trap rope-tree in California
Pope assaulted a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving to trap a rope-tree in California on the first day of the rope-tree season, officials said.
The raid occurred shortly before 1 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-T<0x56> in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream calling for help and then they rowed with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a thrill of trapping a rope-tree, but "I found out that he was screaming, 'I'm bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His shoulder bone had come out," Hammel said he discovered it after reaching the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's sharks in the water!'" Hammel added.
Boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed as in critical condition.
The species of shark that carried out the invasion is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said in a press session that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was noted that it was not a species of endangered shark.
Giles added that the victim sustained injuries in the top of his double.
Officials closed access to the beach from Pontus Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons.
Giles suggested that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter UK beauty market
Sainsbury's wants to fight Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using beauty pageants with staff who are assistant experts.
As a major part of planning to enter the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow with the decline of home fashion and hardware sales, major beauty ranges will be tested in 11 stores across the country and introduced in more stores next year if this phase is successful.
Investment in beauty has come to an end with supermarkets looking for ways to fill elves that were used to install T<0x56>s, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the delivery of beauty products to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing editions beginning in L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find additional spaces with locally placed brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
This supermarket is also relaunching a variety of cosmetic products store so that many of the products are suitable for meat-eating people - which is heavily pressured by young consumers.
Moreover, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will conduct tests at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and consumer preferences for daily food items to a small extent in a nearby retail store means supermarkets have to make more efforts to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive at Sainsbury's, has said that the stores will be more visible as unit stores with the supermarket chain trying to deal with Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been establishing small Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also started some Habitats stores since when it bought the two chains two years ago, which states that it has increased grocery sales and made customer acquisition services more beneficial.
The store's original attempt to revive its beauty and pharmaceutical units came to nothing.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger broke down after a dispute emerged over how to share revenue from pharmacies located in its supermarkets.
A new approach was introduced after Sainsbury's sold its 281st pharmacy business to Celerio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds is said to have contributed to the program, adding more luxury brand products for face-to-face care and skin including La Roche-Posay and <0x56>ichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's business, said: "We have adapted the appearance and condition of our range of beauty products to improve the environment of our customers.
We have also invested in the professional staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our various brands are designed to meet all the needs and attractive environments and the right location means we have now become an exciting place for beauty products that offers great competition for the original ways of doing shopping."
Peter Jones 'disgusted' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million trade deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left 'disgusted' after T<0x56> presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from <0xC2><0xA3>11million trading deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus more on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and IT<0x56>
Willoughby has little time for their Truly brand of household goods and spares.
The two's business was connected to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The publisher of This Morning, aged 37, wrote on Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the stars of Dragons" Den Peter Jones frustrated by withdrawing from their luxury brand-name trade last minute – to focus on his new luxury contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and IT<0x56>.
Sources say Jones was "disgusted" when the popular girl on television admitted in a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, to be her new business plans - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million at home - meant she would not have enough time to handle their choppers.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and had been said to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, wrote on Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly's business, Jones flew from England to one of his vacation homes.
A news source said: "Truly was one of Holly's most focused.
It was to be his permanent future that would allow him to continue over the next several decades.
His decision to withdraw came as a surprise to everyone involved.
No one believed what was going on on Tuesday, the launch time was very close.
There are warehouses full of merchandise at Marlow Headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning's presenter, who are all the most reliable in the United Kingdom, could cost the business millions of dollars due to heavy investment in products including pillows, candles, clothes and household appliances and possible delays in launch.
And it can signal the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple goes on vacation with Jones who owns 40<0x25> in Baldwin's Rubicon manufacturing plant.
Willoughby is expected to be the brand ambassador for M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the IT<0x56> show I'm A Celebrity.
A news source near Jones said last night that "We couldn't comment on his controversial activities."
Strictly speaking 'and then we loved each other'
He joked about the criticisms he would receive from news agencies for commenting that others would consider "unacceptable to the president" and for praising the North Korean leader.
Is President Trump more disappointed?
Trump said in his sarcastic voice "a newscaster".
"I have not given up on anything."
He suggested that Kim prefers to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step in North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, the well-known North Korean ambassador Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the U.N. The United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North Korean nation has not seen a "equal measure" from the United States for the early phases of disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, Marekena has promoted sanctions that are aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump had a hopeful attitude in his speech at a rally.
"We are doing well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we've established a good partnership."
He said his efforts to improve cooperation with Kim have resulted in good results – halting rocket tests, assisting in the release of hostages and assisting in the return home of the dead bodies of American troops.
And he defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded stadium, we'd have 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake Indonesia Severe Damage on Island, Kill Hundreds
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Even though more than 10<0x25> of Lombok's population had been evacuated, no national disaster was declared, a condition needed to stimulate international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have become very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, and that poses a challenge". Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children teamed up together to travel to Palu, you are not sure if foreign workers can work in the center.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster organization, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu in order to see against international organizations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Due to the frequent land tremors that occur in Indonesia, the country there is left in a state of disorganization due to natural disasters.
Although residential shelters due to the tsunami impact have been built in Aceh, they are less common in coastal areas.
The actual lack of tsunami warning bells in Palu, even though the warning was present, may have contributed to the disaster.
In the best of circumstances, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make transport operations complicated.
The hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is heading towards Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the disaster area.
President Joko Widodo used the decaying infrastructure in Indonesia as the core of your electoral campaign, and has spent a lot of money on road and rail construction.
But the financial deficit has been a challenge for Mr. Joko's government as he approaches the election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from sectoral groups, where many Muslim allies have adopted a conservative ideology.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated as groups of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets, killing him with swords, bows and arrows and other sharp weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge strikes an aggressive equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in a Premier League match against Chelsea by closing in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
Sturridge received a bye from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri at around 30 yards from Chelsea gate with his team behind by a score of 1–0.
He moved the ball with his left foot before lifting the scraper to the top of the gate.
The beam flew over the guard area and towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball then passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who had jumped and ended up in the net.

Police arrest a man, aged 32, for alleged murder after a woman was stabbed to death
An investigation into the murder has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 1.55 a.m. with knife wounds on Grayson Mews in John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested for alleged murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to show up.
Detective Superintendent Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages but I would appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead and see or hear anything he doubted to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything with their car cameras to contact us because they may have an explanation that is important to the investigation.'
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was inside the building.
This afternoon friends who believe they know a woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is ongoing and police have said that they are in the process of informing the manga's family members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment but is told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.

Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the latest to face the crisis of 'rewriting history'
His removal will be a worthy right for his destruction similar to the Taliban's for the art of much of Britain's religious and cultural heritage carried out by his ardent Puritan allies.
But the Cromwellian Community described Mr. Crick's proposal as "unprecedented" and "will respond to rewriting history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell's Community, said: "It would have been inevitable in the current debate regarding the desecration of the statue that Oliver Cromwell's model outside Westminster Castle would have been targeted.
The act of destroying symbols in the civil war in England was neither decreed nor enforced by Cromwell.
Perhaps the worst that Cromwell would have been responsible for was the actions of his grandfather Thomas in the last century.
The impressive representation of Mr. William Hamo Thorneycroft to Cromwell is evidence of 19th century views and part of the history of a man whom many believe still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is respected by many, perhaps more in the 19th century than now, as a parliamentarian by external pressure, a situation for which he was a source of royal leadership.
Whether all of this is an accurate representation on the topic of ongoing historical debate.
What is clear is that the mid-17th century wars have laid the groundwork for the future development of our country and Cromwell is a self-proclaimed individualist to represent a single wing in the resistance groups.
His success as Lord Protector also deserves to be celebrated and celebrated."
Pig Killer Shines and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was raided and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China, according to media reports in the area.
The man, identified by the last name of "Yuan," was found dead with a badly damaged vein bleeding near a market hog hut in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give them a vaccine in a hog room on May 20, 2005 in <0x58>ining province of <0x51>inghai, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in a market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and discovered the door to the neighbouring swine hut was open.
He said that at the pig's hut there was a male pig who had blood in his mouth.
An investigation confirmed that the pig weighed <0xC2><0xA3>550 had ruptured and killed the farmer, according to reports.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and broken," a cousin, referred to by his first name as "Wu," said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
<0x56>ideos from security cameras showed Yuan arriving at the market at 10.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by the Yuan nor his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been tied off to prevent it from invading another person, while police gathered evidence in the area.
Yuan's family and market mercenaries are reported to be debating about the mortification of his death.
Although they do not appear frequently, the conditions for pig invasions of humans have been recorded previously.
In 2016, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing <0xC2><0xA3>650 pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until he shocked and escaped.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but tasting blood can be "a catalyst."
"They're just playing.
They smell, and they want to know ... they don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to respect them properly," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rainfall throughout the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa continues to weaken as it passes over more static water along the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa was an 85 mph wind gust, a Type 1 hurricane, at 11 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and was observed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
At this time, atmospheric pressure has begun to accumulate over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward towards the West Coast. with Hurricane Rosa approaching the Baja California peninsula on Monday if a tropical storm begins to push north along the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain across parts of Mexico on Monday
Then, the tropical moisture that begins to interfere with the incoming atmospheric pressure will cause more rainfall in the Southwest in the future.
In inland areas, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will result in dangerous flash floods, mudslides and possible desert landslides.
High tropical humidity will cause rainfall levels of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour in a single area, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall levels of 2 to 4 inches in the southwest, especially most areas of Arizona.
Sudden flooding can occur due to conditions that continue to worsen due to the conditions of the tropical rainforest.
It will be very dangerous to go out into the desert on foot due to the danger of falling in tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to become big rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and scattered dust.
The upcoming Kanieneo atmosphere will bring heavy rainfall to some of the coastal areas of Southern California.
General rates of rainfall greater than half an inch may occur, which can lead to a slight descent of mud and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain on the region in the rainy season.
Some of the high tides of tropical rain will begin towards the Arizona areas later on Sunday and Monday morning, before the rains spread further later on Monday and Tuesday.
Most of the rainfall will cover the Four Corners on Tuesday through Wednesday.
October may have high temperature fluctuations throughout the United States with Aikitic temperatures decreasing, but areas in the tropics will continue to have average temperatures.
Sometimes this causes sudden temperature changes over short distances.
There is a good example of a sudden difference in temperature throughout the central United States on Sunday.
There is approximately a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the heat of the upcoming summer will try to accumulate and spread again.
Most mid and eastern regions of the United States are expected to warm up at the beginning of October and spread as much as 80 degrees from the Southern Plains to the Northwest Territories.
Temperatures in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be 10 degrees closer than average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate a high probability of temperatures exceeding average in the eastern United States until half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh case
Over 20 million people watched the overwhelming evidence on Thursday by Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh and a woman who accuses him of sexual abuse allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming to shed light on Friday's final episode: an agreement enforced by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to the FBI to investigate for a week on charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is 100<0x25> sure that Kavanaugh caught him while he was drunk and tried to strip him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, giving emotional testimony, said that he is 100<0x25> sure that didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people as reported by Nielsen on Friday watched.
The company was counting average viewings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Data was not immediately available from other networks that aired, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And the Nielsen organization usually has the challenge of counting people who are watching in the office.
In order to put this in perspective, the hive is an audience equal to the audience of a college football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose ratings executives have been strongly joined by Kavanaugh's selection, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long trial, the Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Ham was left on top after the trial.
Flake was the main subject in Friday's case.
After this moderate Republican official reported that he would be supporting Kavanaugh's nomination, he was intercepted by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while being booed by lobbyists as he was trying to climb an elevator to attend a Court Committee hearing.
He stood while tilted down for several minutes while being reprimanded, an event shown live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
She was told, "you have power when most women are powerless."
Flake said that his obituary had released a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have much to say in the committee's case.
The broadcasting and cable networks were all broadcasting live hours later, while the Senate Judiciary Committee was voting to continue Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate for a full vote.
But Flake said he could do so with the knowledge that the FBI could investigate allegations against the elector over the next week, which the minority Democrats have been arguing.
Flake was convinced to some extent by a conversation with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was strong, because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation through the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused dissidents of 'playing politics' in relation to Brexit.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plan to withdraw from the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and stigmatizing national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his attacks on his plan known as Chequers for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the European Union should collect tributes of each other is "absolutely ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for the second degree of murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found glasses from the attack area and said they found Simpson's DNA in the glasses, WAFB, a CBS associate, said.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail has been set at <0xC2><0xA3>350,000, the Lawyer reported.
The East Baton Rouge deaths investigator issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head inside the neck.
The department congratulates a Louisiana State Police employee, a police crime lab, a Southern University police and a local citizen for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest of a suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the area lawmakers for their "care and justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot by 6-foot player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played for the LSU basketball team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game the previous season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply affected" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
"Things like this are what makes someone uncomfortable all the time," Wade said.
<0x56>olcano spews ash over Mexico City
The ash that is spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the vicinity of the southern Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased inside the crater and recorded 183 times of emissions and ash for more than 24 hours.
This station was tracking many thunder and vibrations.
Social media images showed thin ash ash covering traffic mirrors in neighboring Mexican city-states such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geologists have discovered an increase in activity on a volcano that is located 45 kilometers (720 miles) south-east of the capital since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
A volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of freedom of voting
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence demonstrators clashed with protest police while thousands joined the protest march to mark the first year of Katalunya's secession vote.
A group of protesters wearing puppets in support of segregation prevented by the police beat them with eggs and threw powder paint at them, resulting in dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally have been crowded with tourists.
Riots also occurred later that day as police used their staff to face clashes.
Over several hours the pro-secessionist groups who were saying "No forgetting, no pardon" confronted the unification protesters who were saying, "Uspianism always."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in protests, local media reported.
Concerns have remained high in the region in favour of independence a year after an October 1 referendum considered illegal by authorities in Madrid but celebrated by Catalunya supporters of secession.
<0x56>oters largely chose to gain independence, although the number of people who showed up was low while those who opposed secession largely ignored voting.
According to the Catalunya authorities around 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting at polling stations across the region causing violent riots.
Liberal support groups had been camping all night on Friday to prevent protests to help the national police.
The protest continued but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the secession march and his wife said he no longer had any hope of Katalunya's prospects for independence.
"Last year we got to live in the best period of life.
I watched my parents cry happily for being able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite securing a crucial victory despite a very small margin in the last regional election in December, pro-Catalunian parties have been unable to maintain momentum in this year as many of the most known leaders are in self-imposed exile or in custody awaiting trial for preparing a referendum and a future report on independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car mechanic recording a protest supporting police on her phone, said that the conflict had been caused by politicians from both sides.
"The anxiety is getting more and more intense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalunian leaders in a pre-trial jail since late last year, announced that he would run for a seat in the European Parliament election next year.
"Standing as an election candidate for the European Parliament is the best way to reject the restoration of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a house hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was accidentally rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballyngard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the gates and the building itself.
The bow bow may also have been launched at some point in time.
Menga's score gives Livingston a 1–0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first run for Livingston ensured victory
Risingston's promotion surprised Rangers with a second-round defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 matches as the club's manager at Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's scratch split split the results between both teams with Gary Holt's team moving up and holding second equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated in foreign matches in the Premier League this season and will face the Hearts leaders, who are ahead of them by eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid <0x56>ienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston have increased the number of unbeaten matches to six in the rankings, with head coach Holt not yet defeated since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston miss out on undefeated visitors
Holt's team had to be ahead long before closing, with their direct attacking game causing Rangers all sorts of trouble.
Scott Robinson was able to score but missed the target with his fumble passed in front of goal, then Alan Lithgow could only hit the ball out after scoring to intercept a header ball from Craig Halkett.
The locals didn't seem nervous and allowed the Rangers to own the game, knowing that they could trouble visitors with the use of the kabu pipra.
And that's the way they were able to tie the goal.
The Rangers were penalised for a hamstring and Livingston struggled to find a gap, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to give Menga a chance, who touched and tied the score from the centre of the box.
During that time, the Rangers had controlled possession of the ball but failed to penetrate the home team's defense and defender Liam Kelly would not be hampered for much of the game,
The format continued in the second period, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save his scraper.
Scott Pittman was prevented from tying the scoreboard with the legs of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow landed the ball out after another Livingston club game.
The attacks continued to clinch Livingston's team's box and continued to be removed, while two of the penultimate allegations - after Halkett dropped reserve player Glenn Middleton, and the other in connection with holding the ball in hand - were ignored.
'''''' from Livingston' - an analysis
Alasdair Lamont at BBC Scotland Profile at Tony Macaroni
A wonderful job and good results for Livingston.
In reality, they had a better game and continue to exceed expectations and by continually climbing the top of the table.
Their style of playing with the team has not changed much since returning to the major leagues, but many compliments go to Holt in the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett made a large contribution, well-intentioned possession of the better-organized defensive fort, while Menga gave them operations each time to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the entire match.
The Rangers missed a no-hitter, however.
Just as they've been good sometimes under Gerrard, they were under those standards.
They missed the final touch at the gate - only once they were able to create a chance to get a bao in the home team's citadel - and this is a challenge for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets a mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
They have varied on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The town is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons as a deterrent for a crowd of 25,000 not to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up in nearby areas to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The two-party protest marks a division about the view of the president who is seen as a hero to some German Turks and denounced by others as a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with car
A cyclist has died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Road and Evelyn Road, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived but the man died at the scene of the incident.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in an incident of being hit and escaped on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday's crash site.
The City Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relative.
Restrictions on road closures and redirection of buses have been put in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison : Six officers are searched in violence
Six prison officials have been injured in violence in a men's high-security jail, the Jela Office said.
A riot occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 9:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Experts "Tornado" have been brought in to deal with the riot, which involves eight inmates and is subjected to a single prison coup.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: "Workers with professional prison training have been brought in to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for minor injuries.
We do not support violence in our prison and it is clear that those responsible will be taken to police and can be extradited to prison."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the governor of the jail received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October the protest officials were called to prison to deal with a major disruption in which workers were attacked with table gambling balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las <0x56>egas, Salt Lake City With Sudden Floods (Saturday Regions Can Benefit)
It is not uncommon for a tropical depression to develop from Arizona, but this is especially likely to occur early next week when the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Western Desert and cause a flash flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued a Monday and Tuesday flash flood warning for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las <0x56>egas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday and close later Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has described on Twitter that "10 tropical cyclones have maintained storms and low pressure conditions within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a tornado within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
Recent examples of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, as well as low levels of up to 6 inches on Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Western Desert including the Great Basin Rockies have access to 1 to 2 inches and access to a few levels of up to 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of flash flooding, the rain of hurricane Rosa can be a blessing because the area is drought-prone.
Although flooding is a major concern, some of these rains may be beneficial because the South West region is experiencing arid conditions.
According to the U.S. drought Monitor. Just over 40<0x25> of Arizona is seeing at least a severe drought, the second highest form," Weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to the ground through the territory of the Baja California Mexican peninsula.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning and a peak intensity of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is heading north for 12 miles an hour.
The storm is subjected to static water in the Pacific and therefore its strength is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected to reach land in Mexico with tropical storm strength during the day or Monday evening.
Rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be very high, causing a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to Sonora in the northwest and likely to reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then upward through Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the Northwest Sonora Desert and the United States. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
Rainfall is expected to cause sudden life-threatening flooding and mudslides in deserts and landslides in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Arrest of four attempted murder victim
Three 20-year-old man have been arrested on charges of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured at Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, at around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he has been admitted to a "solid" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, an 18-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have requested anyone who may have intercepted and recorded an incident with a cell phone to appear.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'expressed, bored and angry' by Democrats
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote is a vote to reject the brutal and monstrous tactics of the Democrat Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West <0x56>irginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has been shown to be bored and angry" by the Democrat Party during its entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Parliament on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally rejecting claims from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually abused her several decades ago when they were young.
Ford also testified in the case about the woman's allegations.
The President said Saturday that "the American people saw the intelligence and excellence and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to prove Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to prove one of the most legally completed intelligences of our times, a lawyer with a good record of service to the public," he told the West <0x56>irginia crowd.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters coming forward to vote in the House of Representatives elections.
"Five weeks from now one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running for, but from another perspective I'm really running for," he said.
"That's why I'm circling around to beat down good candidates."
Trump said that Democrats intend to "oppose and prevent."
The first important systematic vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, the GOP's senior leadership assistant has told CNN.
Hundreds of people are killed in the earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia and death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed, many were swept away when large waves reached the shore, while a large earthquake and tsunami shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a ceremony on the coast in the city of Palu on Friday when six-metre (18 ft) waves struck land at night and swept many and destroyed and destroyed everything there was.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still carrying out operations on the coast and did not run immediately and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster prevention agency BNPB said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come its only one, it came with moving cars, logs, houses, it affected everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that a tsunami had travelled on open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before attacking the coast.
Some people planted trees to avoid a tsunami and saved themselves," he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 stations in Palau.
Air photos released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges overturned and sank by a mosque surrounded by water.
Small vibrations continued to be heard in the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were heard in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Promotion and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was nearly 200 times as strong as the atomic bomb that was detonated in Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, which is located at the end of the narrow-gauge flood may have caused an increase in tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the state of destruction as being "major" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels were destroyed.
. The bodies of some of the victims were found stuck in the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 others were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, which is called Donggala , which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication was "completely halted without any information" from Donggala , Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but it can be worse," it said.
The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not declaring that a tsunami had struck Palu , although leaders said the waves arrived shortly after the warning was issued.
In a non-professional video shared on social media, a man in the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting tsunami warnings approaching people on the street.
Within minutes the tide reaches the coast and carries buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power loss in a wide area which interrupted communications near Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes and supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated still need food and other basic necessities.
The town's airport is only open to relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit rescue stations in Palu on Sunday.
Death toll from Indonesian Tsunami Rises Over 800.
It's So Bad.
With World <0x56>ision crews from Donggala having achieved safety in the town of Palu, where crews are sheltering in tents set up outside their arsenal, they went through a series of devastating events along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they saw a lot of homes destroyed" he said.
It's terrible.
Even though aid groups began relief operations, some complained that foreign workers with deep expertise were being barred from travelling in Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, funds, equipment and personnel from abroad can only begin to enter if a disaster declares it national.
That hasn't been done yet.
"It's still a regional level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government has said, "OK, this is a national disaster," we can open up to international support but there is still no such situation."
When the second night hit the city of Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those who were lost were hopeful that their loved ones will find each other and make it a miracle in their hopeless stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was found from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been lying under rubble for two days and her mother's body near her.
Gendon Subandono , coach of the Indonesia national umbrella jump team, had trained two of the umbrella jump players who had been lost for the Asian Games, which was completed this month in Indonesia.
Others stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a leader in the field of umbrella jumping, I have my emotional load," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained how, hours after information about the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the community of participants in the umbrella jump game, he had sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were participating in a beach event.
His message, however, featured one grey mark, rather than two blue marks.
"I think that means that the message was not read," he said.
Thieves take <0x24>26,750 when filling ATM at Levee's Newport
Thieves on Friday morning stole <0xC2><0xA3>26,750 from a Brink employee as he was filling in an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to information released from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was removing money from the ATM in the entertainment hall and preparing to put more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While dealing, another man "run off from the back of a Brink employee" and stole a bag of money that was meant to be shipped.
Witnesses saw several suspects escaping from the scene of the incident, according to reports, but police did not describe the specific number of people involved in this incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police on 859–292-3680.
Kanye West: Sponge artist changes her name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to - Ye.
Announcing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A creature officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye's nickname for a while and used it as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
This change occurs before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to launch her new album Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show who regretted "emotional reasons ," the show's producer said.
Despite being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the term has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'he' is a widely used term in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, referring to the name of his album by radio producer Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It changed from Kanye, which means special person, to just be Ye - to be the image of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more symbolic of who we are."
He's one of the famous rappers who changed their names
Sean Combs was often known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preferences for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West member, JAY-Z, has also had to use his name with or without the bottom frame line and capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country is about to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never would use an army to deal with the Mexican people."
The troops shot at a peaceful protest in the building on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people while the leftist student movement was taking root in Latin American countries.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by offering a monthly fundraiser to students and opening unpaid public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double A.I. funding.
As China continues to be more involved in brainstorming, the United States should double the amount of money it spends on research in the field there, said AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after various U.S. government units made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. generally lacks the official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China launched its program last year: and it aims to be number 1 in the AI's innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI budget will be a good start, given the situation that all other countries are far behind than the United States and we are looking for new innovations in the AI," Lee said.
Increasing the double bonus could double the chance that the next AI's biggest success will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon <0x56>alley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director of Innovation <0x56>entures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face <0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he developed an AI system that surpassed the U.S.-class Othello player and later became active in Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China branch.
Lee agreed that the original U.S. government technology competition as of the Robotics Association in the Defense Deep Research Programs and asked to know when the next competition would be, to help identify the next experts.
Researchers in the United States often have to do extra work to get government aid," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes professional leaders, it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired stars from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said the change in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in AI.
"I think green cards should be issued directly to PhD students at AI," he said.
The Chinese State Committee released its Development Plan in Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Dedication of Natural Sciences donates money to people in educational institutions similar to how the Dedication of Natural Science and other government agencies donate money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Center for Cooperation in Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage partners from the sector with academics and the White House announced the creation of a Study Committee in Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
For NSF, it currently funds over <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law that wanted to create the National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence has not been in action for several months now.
Macedonian referendum on the name change of country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday about the change of its name to "the Republic of North Macedonia," a move that could resolve a multi-year conflict with Greece that hinders its request for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a region called Macedonia, has maintained that the name of neighbouring countries in the north represents a claim for its province and has opposed the country's request for membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June according to the proposed new name, but national opponents say the change will bolster the ethnic recognition of the majority of the Slavic people in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a campaign of neglect to vote has caused doubt as to whether the voter turnout will reach the 50<0x25> threshold required for the referendum to be correct.
The question in the referendum reads: "Do you support NATO and EU membership and agree to an agreement with Greece."
Followers of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a proper bond to be paid to be admitted into organizations such as the European Union and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries created as a result of the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU because the move there means a safe life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally recognized, enough members of parliament have said they will support the results of the vote to make it more serious.
The name change will require the support of two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The country's electoral commission has said that there have been no reports of violations by seven o'clock in the afternoon.
However, the voter turnout was only 16<0x25>, compared to 34<0x25> in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016 while 66<0x25> of registered voters voted.
""I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski , 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in Macedonia to change the name of the country a move that will open the way for NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of Skopje's parliament, 54-year-old <0x56>ladimir Kavardarkov was organizing a small platform and organizing seats in front of tents created by those who would oppose the referendum.
"We are joining NATO and the European Union, but we want to join voluntarily, not through the back door under pressure" said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to recruit us like Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian cooperation."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of 20<0x25>.
"I believe a large number will support because 80<0x25> of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that the "yes" result would be "evidence of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said between 30<0x25> and 43<0x25> of voters will participate in the referendum - less than necessary .
Another study, conducted by Macedonian Telma T<0x56> , found that 57<0x25> of participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70<0x25> said they would vote yes.
In order for a referendum to roll out the number of electors it should be 50<0x25> and one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will represent the first major blow to a government-backed Western policy since it took over in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City surrounds Brighton Castle and closes their
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling humiliated the Brighton defenders in a match which Manchester City won 2–0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem so easy when he tied the score in the 65th minute.
Argentina's attacker got an iron in the middle of the field and started the series.
He passed among Brighton's three beers, before penetrating the open area.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players.
He pushed one bet and then faster than the others at the corner of the Brighton gate box.
He then ironed in his left side, and found Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the box and returned the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot around Brighton gate keeper Mathew Ryan and a concussion into the right side of the net.
"Aguero faces some problems in his legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55 minutes, 60.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored them at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the team Sky Blues first-team control in the Premier League match.
The score was tied in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a ball into the Brighton area in the attack.
He ironed a good referee through the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched a few times before handing Sterling the other side of the gate.
The Sky Blues attacker touched the ball into the net before starting to celebrate.
City face Hoffenheim in a group match of the Champions League at 12:55pm Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a destroyer vs. the Rockies
With the Nationals already eliminated from the playoffs, he had no other reasons to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scherzer hopes to be a block on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a significant impact in the draft for the Rockies, who are proud to have one game they haven't played against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies won the qualifying play-off by winning 5–2 against National on Friday night, but are still looking for the first crown in the rankings.
"Although we don't play to get anything, at least we can play a tough game in terms of what the situation is going to be in Denver and the crowd and the other team there will be playing at the highest level at every level I'm going to face this year .
Why should I not want to compete at that level?"
Nationals have yet to announce players who will start the game on Sunday, but say they have liked to let Scherzer drop the ball in the situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting his 34th game, trained to launch on Thursday and will be launching on his rest day on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player is 18–7 with a 2.53 run average and 300 points to be eliminated by striking out 220 2<0x2F>3 runs this season.
Trump holds West <0x56>irginia summit
The President indirectly referred to the situation facing his elector Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the sons of Republicans to appear in a plurality in the election of representatives.
"All the results we found were in jeopardy in November.
Five weeks from the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the biggest, biggest choices -- I don't run for but from another perspective I really run for and that's why I'm going around to beat the debe good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this awful, very intimidating group of Democrats, you see what they're doing right now.
And they've decided to take power by any means possible, you can see the boredom, the depravity.
They don't care about the people who hurt them, who mistake him for power and control, what they want is power and control, we can't give them."
He said, the Democrats intend to "oppose and prevent."
"And you can see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "an angry and awkward and perverse and lying people."
He named a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who is Dianne Feinstein by name, which caused the audience to yell at him.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you expose a document in the wrong way?
Uh, uh, it's what.
No, not, I waited for one - that was a very weak body language - the worst language I've ever witnessed."
The Football Association is no longer the church in general.
It does not tolerate free thought
When Momentum activists at my local party voted to remove me, it wasn't very surprising.
After all, I'm one in the line of the Legislators to be told that we're not going to be wanted - all by saying our thoughts.
His colleague in parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because he stood by his rebellion against the discrimination of the Jews.
In my case, the proposal to remove me shocked me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of appropriate economic policy, on national security, on the issue of Europe, the allegation is that the issues are similar to those in which Jeremy differs from previous leaders.
A statement to the Leba meeting in East Nottingham on Friday explained that "we want the meetings to be communal and productive."
For more than eight years as a regional Leba MP, Friday night GC meetings have been fully inclusive of this.
Unfortunately today, it didn't look like many meetings and the promise of "gentle, generous" politics had long been forgotten if, in fact, it had begun.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not accepted in the Leba party and all views are considered good if only accepted by the party leadership.
it started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as my partner who I was thinking we share the same political outlook began to expect me to change my mind completely and take positions that I would never agree with - whether it's about national security or a single market in the EU.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I'm saying - what follows is an insult on social media and an effort to want me not to be elected, to reject middle-class politics, and to tell me that I shouldn't be in the Leba party.
And it's not the situation I've gone through on my own.
Sure, I know I'm more lucky than my other colleagues because the views directed at me are political.
I respect the skill and expression of my colleagues who are faced with everyday sexual insult or color but never give up.
One of the drawbacks of contemporary politics is how abuse rates are considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Leba party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a communal church and for each debate the wra "lacks faith" or changes in the principles of selection, the party becomes narrower in integration.
I've received a lot of advice over the last two years being urged to calm down, not to talk too much and that "I'll be fine."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Leba party 32 years ago as a school student, due to an incentive to be ignored by the Thatcher government that left my full school class on the brink of collapse, I have strived to fight for better public service for those who need it most - whether it be a regional councillor or a government minister.
I haven't hidden the kind of politics from them, including in the previous election.
No one in East Nottingham was able to be confused about the attitude in policy and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who brought forward the debate on Friday, all I'll say is that as the country is about to leave the European Union popular Brexit, a move that will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Leba party.
But in fact one of my messages is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to the public in my area, whether members of the Leba party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no amount of intimidation or political correctness will stop me from considering what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's unbeaten team takes first place on the table
Two tries in the final may have somewhat altered the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this highly anticipated Premier League match.
They are now leading the tables, the only team that has not failed.
Ultimately, it was their best defense , as well as the use of their positions, which helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie was entitled to satisfaction.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we haven't failed yet, so I must be happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "Thanks to Ayr, they took their best chances at being insulted."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, scored by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish team player Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having many players and Jason Baggot got to score a try that was not tied.
Climo added Ayr's lead to the penultimate, just before the break, scored and then completed a solo try and made the score 17–5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's try, tied with Baggot, reduced the lead by five points.
The game was then stopped for a while after a fatal injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was removed as the game was rescheduled, Ayr increased his lead with Stafford McDowall's try, scored by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again, Melrose took the opportunity to have one more player and scored a try by Bruce Colvine , at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home team took control again, however, when Struan Hutchinson was awarded a yellow card for playing poorly for Climo without the ball and from the penultimate line out, MacPherson scored due to a strong attack from Ayr.
Climo scored, the way he was doing after the game started again, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's fumble and fumbled Gregor Henry and scored the fifth try for the home team.
The Star of the Still Game takes a new job in the restaurant industry
The star of the show Still Game Ford Kieran appears to enter the housing sector after it is discovered that he has been appointed as a director of a certified restaurant company.
The 56-year-old starring Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show, for which he is the author and co-star of his long-time collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the show and seem to Kiernan has another deal in life after Craiglang .
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun newspaper claimed Kiernan was expecting to be involved in a "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"'The ocean is ours': Bolivia that has no port hopes that the court will open access to the Pacific
The crew patrols at sea headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have lit a blue flag like the sea.
Sea stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are recorded as saying: "The sea is our right.
To restore it is a duty."
All in Bolivia without a port, the memory of the coastal strip that it lost to Chile in the 19th century resource crisis is still open--just like the desire to travel again in the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps the prospect is now at its highest for many years, with Bolivia awaiting an international court of justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has a pace, a spirit of solidarity and stability and indeed has the prospect of a positive attitude towards the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat.
The majority of Bolivians will look at the ICJ's decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will issue a decision that accepts Bolivia's demands - after several decades of appropriate talks - Chile will be forced to discuss a move to give Bolivia access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's natural president - who faces bitter confrontation in next year's re-election - also has much to do with Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he swore in late August.
But some critics believe that there is a small possibility that the court will issue a decision that is appropriate for Bolivia - and that there will be very little change even if it so decides.
The Netherlands-based agency does not have the authority to redistribute Chile to other countries, and has said that it cannot determine the outcome of the talks expected to take place.
The ICJ's decision will be given only six months after the final debate points out that the case is "not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate , a Chilean expert in international law.
And besides keeping Bolivia's hope alive, the last four years may have brought it back.
"The issue of sea access is being exploited by the current Bolivian regime," said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate .
Morales' political statements have ended Chile's remaining goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will continue the talks, but it will be very difficult to do the negotiations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged diplomats since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez <0x56>eltz<0xC3><0xA9> , Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were too quick.
Monday will give Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of diversity for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales—still one of the most popular presidents in the United States of America—was using the issue of the sea as a political channel.
"Bolivia will never give up on its right to reach the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we need to go forward."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be possible unless it has confidence in the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation will never remove its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises it made during a meeting in Singapore between opposition leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to re-establish a nuclear diplomacy that had been unsuccessful over three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean president Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "little dream" that developing sanctions and U.S. opposition to a report ending the Korean War will ever make the North weak.
Washington is afraid to accept information without Pyongyang first making the necessary disarmament measures.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump both want a second meeting.
But there is great doubt that Pyongyang is considering a decommissioning measure that the country considers as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to host the second Kim-Trump summit.
The fashion show in Paris features modern headers heading to the Royal Stores near you
If you want to add a collection of your hats or completely block the sun then you have thrown a solution.
Experts <0x56>alentino and Thom Browne unveiled massive headphones in their collection SS19 in a stage show that surprised creatively at Fashion Week in Paris.
The hats that are hard to create have attracted many in Instagram this summer and these designers have presented these beautiful hats to be used in the fashion platform.
<0x56>alentino's most impressive design was of a tan hat set on broad feather-like edges that covered the heads of the models.
Other large items include examples of a shaker, a witch's hat and even a pineapple – but they are not designed to heat your head.
Thom Browne also revealed the strange cobblers – by the time Halloween is about to come.
Many colored scarves had stitches and look more like Hannibal Lecter than fashion skills
One design resembled a skyuba-style bunker with a bubbler and glasses, while the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you're going to go on a great fashion report - you're lucky.
Fashion viewers predict that big hoods can be on their way to luxury stores near you.
<0x56>ery large hats offer a design in 'La Bomba', a straw hat with edges of two-figure wide and leading everyone to wear it from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Lebo supporters developed this complex hat which was offered on social media made another high-end design used in the fashion platform - a small size bag that uses a swimwear model
An orange raffia bag, placed on the edge with a leather handle, was the main attraction at the conventions of Jacquemus' La Riviera of SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.
Popular fashion expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I look forward to seeing big hats and sneakers coming to stores next summer - because the architect has brought a huge impact that will be difficult to ignore the demand for big equipment.'
John Edward: Language skills are important to the international community
Scotland's independent schools continue to maintain a record of academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another set of best test results, which are reinforced by personal and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
Despite an increase of over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Council of Independent Schools in Scotland (popular SCIS), are working towards providing a better standard of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to provide their students with more education and higher education, their choice of professions and their position as international citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a specialized school curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be popular and a preferred subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his native language it goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't just rely on English when we want to build relationships with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exam, we can see that the languages lead the league table with high scores in independent schools.
A total of 68<0x25> of foreign language learners received the upper A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72<0x25> of students received the upper A in Mandarin and 72<0x25> for those learning German, 69<0x25> for those learning French and 63<0x25> for those learning Spanish as well.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will need in their future.
Languages now, as an elective subject, are considered to the same extent as STEM classes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school courses and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Commission on Employment and Skills found that one of the reasons employers said they find when they have a challenge to fill jobs, 17<0x25> was associated with a lack of language skills .
So more and more, knowledge of language becomes necessary to provide young people with their future professions.
While many job opportunities are required for language, this knowledge is essential in the world of globalization.
Regardless of the profession one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a more realistic chance in the future of having a life experience like this.
Having the ability to communicate directly with foreign people will put the person who speaks different languages in front of the competition.
According to YouGov's survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75<0x25> were unable to speak a foreign language well to promote conversations in French which is the only language spoken by a percentage of twoi, 15<0x25>.
This is why investing in language training is now important for current children.
Having multiple languages, especially those in developing countries, will give children a good chance of meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will have a different language that is teaching.
Several schools will consider more advanced languages, where some will teach languages that are considered the most important for Britain in the future until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, as well as instructional professionals in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will provide children with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of their future professions.
It cannot be disputed that at this time, in the state of international trade, that languages continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as "international knowledge of communication."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and quality to Scots youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Council of Independent Schools in Scotland
LeBron played his first game with the Sunday Lakers in San Diego
The waiting time is nearly over for fans eager to see LeBron James play their first match as a Los Angeles Lakers player.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a pre-season game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet clear how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than a minute and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers writer Mike Trudell explained in a tweet that James could play a few minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in the Lakers' schedule of "six pre-season games.
"I don't need any pre-season games at this point in my game to be ready," he said.
Trump's Political Forum in West <0x56>irginia, YouTube Channel
Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West <0x56>irginia.
It will be the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including standings in which he has many supporters including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to prove still standing about who appointed him to fill the seat of the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to create electoral support as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
How many hours will Trump's rally in West <0x56>irginia be and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West <0x56>irginia is scheduled at 1 p.m. Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West <0x56>irginia rally online through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week's case about Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh, which has brought a lot of concerns about allegations of sexual abuse that led to a temporary suspension of Senate confirmation vote for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the goal of this round of meetings is to beat the debe candidates for the Republicans in the November election to gain more popularity.
Accordingly, President Trump's campaign committee said these five meetings over the next week are aimed at empowering volunteers and supporters with the Republican party trying to secure and expand the plurality of seats in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Senate's control is vital to its agenda so the president will travel in as many states as possible as we approach a more active campaign season," a Trump campaign committee spokesman who refused to be identified told Reuters.
Scheduled to be held at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, tonight's rally may bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh's press coverage," according to the West <0x56>irginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West <0x56>irginia, a state that he won with over 40<0x25> of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help <0x56>irginia's West <0x56>irginia Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who stands behind in the poll.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must arrive to try to improve his position in the election," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West <0x56>irginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: American team shows off to fight and maintain hope heading to a one-man game on Sunday
After three one-sided periods, a two-to-two Saturday afternoon game can be a thrill that the Ryder Cup needs
The course of the stables' swaying is a completely invented concept of games but in which players really believe and even more in tournaments such as
So they'll say where's the speed going now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we take that as a bit faster I think," said Jordan Spieth after the day's conclusion.
Europe have better chances, of course, they are ahead with four points, remaining twelve of the knockouts.
The Americans, as Spieth puts it, feel that they have extra powers and have a lot to encourage them, also taking into account the Spieth and Justin Thomas game that they played all day together and everyone is proud of three out of four scores.
Spieth has been dangerous from the beginning of the game to the game hole and leads by being a role model.
The high scoring noise increased as his turn continued, scoring the ball after hitting the ball towards the pit and balancing while he and Thomas were down by two points after two turns.
His ball-to-hole beat earned them a 15-hole match and got a lot of noise to celebrate, which shows him believing that the U.S. team is not yet heartbroken.
"You really have to work hard and consider your own match," Spieth said.
Now that's all these players have left to do now.
Eighteen holes are waiting for them to show this.
The only players with more marks than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the ambiguous story of the Ryder Cup.
The remarkable pair from Europe has a score of four out of four and have so far made no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to hit the ball the most on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided hitting the ball the most on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and in the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
That quality, and how their strength seems to increase between them and the crowd shows that those players are the ones that will give the highest competition on Sunday and probably no other top players can win for Europe when the day ends in the Le Golf National if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
Good if all will do so at the same time in different holes.
It is very early to discuss victory for Europe, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson faced each other in a duel with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in a game of two against two, when he formed a pair with Alex Noren.
An extra kick and two more balls in the first nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swiss in a situation that was difficult to get out.
Sunday, however, no one can get you out of the situation you're going to get into.
The game of two versus two is very exciting to watch closely because of the interaction between the pair, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategy can change on the spot.
Europe has done its best as a team to date and taken a big lead towards the final day but this pair versus pair show also that the US team has a fighting spirit that some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe lead 10–6 in the Ryder Cup on final day
Europe will have a good chance on the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning in a pair match with four balls to 10–6 against the United States.
A pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game with two victories over Tiger Woods who seemed overwhelmed and bringing their total score to date at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to rest with the Cup that they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, led the United States seemingly overwhelmed in a four-ball morning game, winning the series 3–1.
The United States drew more opposition in the pairs matches against the pair and won two matches, but were unable to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 games to stay with the Cup.
Fleetwood is the first new player in Europe to win four consecutive points when he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a thrilling weekend became only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball match they teamed up well and defeated Wood and American Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who was back in both matches on Saturday, showed good play periods but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in a four-ball match with seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who rested for a four-ball match in the morning, returned to teaming with Henrik Stenson in a pair match and was defeated 2 and 1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - they were listed in the first and third places in the world.
Europe didn't get everything though the day was good, with a beautiful wind in southwest Paris.
The three-time major cup winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a pattern for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They scored 2 and 1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a 4-ball match and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in a pair game after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team managed to come from behind with four points to go in a one-man game, although the Furyk team only needs to get out of uniform to remain with the Cup.
Having been in second place for two days, however, the winning fight on Sunday seems to be going away with them.
North Korea says 'impossible' will disarm without the belief that others will do what they should.
North Korea's Foreign Affairs Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was undermining further distrust of the United States and there is no way the country could remove its nuclear weapons without others doing what they should under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken "good measures of goodwill" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking the nuclear test center and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence from the United States there will be no confidence in our national security in such a situation and there is no way we will remove our weapons first without others doing what they should."
While Ri again stressed North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to the "action" approach by removing nuclear weapons in which North Korea would get a reward if it took a small step, his statement seemed important as it did not refuse a nuclear disarmament on the condition that Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the current President of the United States and North Korean leader Singapore on June 12, while Kim promised to work to "removal of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has been looking for a formal solution to the Korean war of 1950–53, but the United States says Pyongyang must remove its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected calls to end international sanctions against North Korea.
The "U.S. insists" first on nuclear disarmament" and increases the level of pressure by using sanctions to reach their goal through coercion and even opposition to the "end declaration of war," Ri said.
"The view that sanctions may not weaken is an impossible dream from people who ignore us.
But the problem is that ongoing barriers promote mistrust.
"Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader alluded to in the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead illuminated three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If an ally on this issue of removing nuclear silos would be South Korea and not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula would not be in this dire situation."
However, Ri's speech was somewhat different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland and North Korean rockets would be inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump referred to Kim as a "rocket man" with the goal of carrying out the assassination.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said major work should still be done and sanctions should remain until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia say that the United Nations Security Council should relieve Pyongyang of its actions.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue in detail and without fail until we find a complete, final and predictable elimination of nuclear weapons."
Together, the Security Council has increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to withdraw funds for Pyongyang nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri after the UN General Assembly later said that he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his final tour went poorly.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress has been made, but only within hours North Korea accused him of offering "the same terms as a criminal."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy both the missile base and nuclear weapons facility if the United States takes "related actions."
He said Kim had told him that the "related measures" he was wanting were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and headed towards strengthening relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught a lesson in getting enough breaks.
A new lesson at Harvard University this year requires all undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to combat the culture of pretending to be gentlemen and to read for ‘all night' with coffee assistance.
‘A specialist discovered students at university number one in the world are not knowledgeable about the basic issue of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created the subject, which he believes to be the first American type.
.He was encouraged to create a lesson after giving a lecture about how inadequate sleep affects instruction.
'At the end of the speech, a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I just being told these things now, in my last year?"
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The lesson, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how a good sleep style helps with academic and sports activities and also improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to start the subject after discovering that students had been severely insomnia during the week.
The hourly lesson involves a series of shared activities.
In one place there is a picture of the bedroom, where students click for coffee, curtains, shoes and books and are described about the effects of coffee and light and how sports activities are affected by insomnia and the importance of the sleep schedule.
In other places, participants are told how chronic insomnia can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, malnutrition and cancer.
A college map and accomplice, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know the lesson will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as much as you have the right to know the harm to health when you smoke,' Professor Czeisler added.
Proud culture in 'wake up' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means insomnia was an ongoing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep, with good quality, you should be a student's 'secret weapon' to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said — even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the mind in a state of dissatisfaction and makes you hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create a subject, having participated in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the lesson opened his eyes and gave him a taste for creating an entire college class.
The next step, hopefully, is to ask all graduate students to take a corresponding course before joining a highly competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should consider installing both the bedtime bell and the wake time bell and be aware of the effects of the 'blue light' given by electric screens and LED lights, which can damage the brain clock and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga barges young Gerrard
The Rangers lost again in another home game when Dolly Menga's scrapper crippled Steven Gerrard's seemingly overwhelmed team by a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team had been aiming to secure their first victory at home since a 4–1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard to lose for the second time in 18 games as manager and left the team to eight points behind Ladbrokes League leaders, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and Rangers never looked like it would equalise.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and are only behind Hibernian by a go-goal difference.
And there could be more problems for Rangers after flag bearer Calum Spence needed treatment after a head injury to something thrown from Rangers' supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that tied Ayr in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used all 11 players who gained uniforms against Hearts last week and will be pleased with how well-prepared his team faced their opponents all the time.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball but Livingston took advantage of their chances when they got the ball.
They had to score just the second minute when the first ball of Menga gave Scott Pittman a pass to Allan McGregor but the midfielder threw the ball out.
A draw from Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his partner in defence Alan Lithgow was only able to hit it out of goal.
The Rangers took control but their game seemed only faith-based but not confidence as they approached the closing scene.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he would have to score a brace in the 15th minute after being knocked out by Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson said the game would continue after the Colombian claim.
Rangers managed to hit two touchdowns in the goal during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly would not get much trouble with the head ball from Lassana Coulibaly and a weak interception from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's goal in the 34th minute was not due to a normal game, no one can deny that they deserve the win.
Again the Rangers failed to cope with a catapult ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher bowled the ball to Scott Robinson, who was strong and hitting the ball towards the Manga who touched and scored.
Gerrard made the decision during the break and substituted Coulibaly and Ryan Kent and the move was about to get the result when the midfielder passed the ball to Morelos but Kelly ran away from the part and blocked the ball.
But Livingston continued to upset the visitors and get them to play as they wanted, with Lithgow and Halkett hitting a long ball after.
Holt's team could score more goals in the final minutes but McGregor was steady and prevented Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball out with a header.
Rangers reserve player Glenn Middleton had another claim for the penultimate moments when they faced Jacobs but referee Thomson again ignored a request away.
Player of the Year: Geiger Counter device inventor
And now a page from our annual saga of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and on TODAY ... the day future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed the method of detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger Counter.
Based on science since then, Geiger Counter's device became popular in pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bell of Coronado," which included scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man: "What's that in this world?"
Rogers: "It's Counter Geiger's device, it's used to detect minerals, such as uranium.
When you install these headsets, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the fluorescence inside the mineral."
Evans: "Say, it's starting to sound now!"
Hans "Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.

New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells and kill them
<0x56>accination teaches the immune system to identify bad cells as part of treatment
The technique involves cooling the immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the laboratory
They can then 'see' a protein that is prominent in most cancers and then refolded.
Test vaccines show positive results in patients with various cancers.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize severe cells, was able to receive treatment for her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
This method involves cooling immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the lab so that they can "see" the normal protein for most cancers called HER2, and then refolding them.
. Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Saratani Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very credible vaccine."
HER2 "induces the development of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and gut and purpurea, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching them" how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West Has Started a Long, Bittersweet Trump, Wearing a MAGA Shot, After Appearance on the SNL Show.
It didn't go well.
Kanye Kanye West was cast in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a high-profile show in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he could hold office for them in 2020.
After a performance of his third song for the night, Ghost Town where he was wearing a hat written Make America Great, he began reprimanding the Democrats and promised support for Trump.
"Many times when I talk to a white man he always says: "How can you love Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism I would leave America a very long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a briefing that included Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the event was not broadcast, West's content was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock attempted to discredit West for the publication.
West had also complained to the audience that he had had a hard time before entering the stage regarding his hat.
"They treated me badly behind the stage.
They said, 'don't go there with that hat.'
They abused me!
And then they said that I'm in a state where I've sunk," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see a sinking place?" saying that he'll put on my brave knight hat, because this means you can't tell me what I'm good at doing. What do you want the world to go ahead?
Try love."
His comments were troubling to have been dismissed at least twice from the apparently ashamed SNL audience and staff, the <0x56>ariety Center reported, with one person there reporting the publication: "The entire studio went completely quiet."
West had been brought in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West surprised many when he sang the song I Love It, dressed as a Bottle of Perrier Waters.
West was joined by conservative TPUSA leader, Candace Turner who published her tweet: "To one of the bravest people: ASEAN FOR COMMUNITY AND UMMA."
But talk show host Karen Hunter published a tweet that West was just "showing off his attitude and that's a pretty good thing."
"But I choose someone else (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe agrees to spread an ideology that is dangerous to my community.
He has freedom.
Even we as well," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has changed to Snoop Lion and of course the late bassist Prince, changed his name to Sign and then an artist previously known as Prince.

The Star of Game of Thrones episode Kit Harington rebukes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington starred as Jon Snow in the HBO reality series Game of Thrones.
But the actress, 31, has reprimanded those with opium of a lot of masculinity, saying the roles on the screen mean young boys often feel like they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'there's something wrong with the place' and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow Rose Leslie, also a 31-year-old, admitted he feels 'many' in handling this issue.
'I feel personally, absolutely strongly, at the moment - where have we been wrong in the matter of masculinity?', He said.
'We've been teaching men what they're growing up, according to the issue of the problem we're seeing now?'
'Kit believes that television could be a role played by an increase in toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
He continued: 'What is authentic and what is taught?
Is that what's taught on T<0x56>, and in the streets, that makes little boys feel like they should be this kind of man?
I think that's one of the big questions at the moment that we live in - how are we going to change that?
Because things are definitely going beyond our youth.
In an interview he also admitted that he would no longer be involved in the pre and follow-up episodes of Game of Thrones when the series ends next season, saying he is satisfied with the battlefield and the horse.
From November Kit will be featured in a film from Sam Shepard's book True West which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a thief.
The character recently revealed that the stage encounter with his wife Rose was best due to her involvement in Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife at this point, in the same way I got my future family, and my life from there,' he said.
Rose starred as Ygritt , a love interest of the character Jon Snow who starred as Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The lovers married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie Scotland's family.
HI<0x56><0x2F>AIDS: China reports an increase of 14<0x25> for new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of citizens living with HI<0x56> and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health leaders say.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Many of the new events were caused by sex, and signaled changes from the old.
HI<0x56> naturally spread rapidly in other areas of China due to blood exchange.
But the number of people infected with HI<0x56> in this way had decreased to zero, Chinese health leaders said at a rally in Yunnan province.
. However, year after year, the number of those living with HI<0x56> and Aids in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted HI<0x56> infections are a serious issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality in China was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be very high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70–90<0x25> of men in same-sex love eventually marry women.
Most of the disease's pathogens come from the lack of sexual immunity in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged access to all HI<0x56> drugs as part of efforts to address this issue.
Maxine Waters denies that her staffer exposed the data of GOP senators, reprimanded the 'dangerous lies' and the 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied claims that her staffer published a personal profile of three Republican senators on the members' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic congressman from Los Angeles said that allegations were being spread by analysts and websites of "right-wing extremists".
"False, false, and more meaningless lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The comments made allegedly include home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Comments appeared online Thursday, published by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on charges of sexual abuse charges against Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosures came within a few moments after the senators accused Kavanaugh.
Conservative areas such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that an IP address that recognizes the source of publications was linked to the Waters office and commented Waters employee, Hill reported.
"These underlying claims are totally false and totally misleading," Waters continued.
"My employee — whose identity, personal details, and safety have been affected by these allegations of fraud and perjury — never had anything to do with exposing these details.
Such unfounded claims are completely false and totally misleading."
Waters' report was quickly hacked online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the right emotional control to be a Parliamentary Delegate.
When a man is exploited for something he did not act, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't worry.
He should not interview the complainant's motives.
He should be calm and calm.
"Fleischer was seen as comparing Waters' response to criticism of the Democrats against Justice Kavanaugh, who was criticized by critics for appearing angry at a hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate through the Republican Party who is seeking to remove Waters from the House of Representatives elections, also published his thoughts on Twitter.
"The big thing if it's true," he said on tweet.
In a statement, Waters said his office had notified "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false claims.
"We will ensure that those who have acted on this matter are exposed, "continued," and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to all of my people and staff."
Johnny English movie review Strikes Again - a joke in Rowan Atkinson's poor detective
It is common to look at the effects of Brexit in any new film that leans towards Britain but that doesn't apply to the warmth of another comedy-war film with a comedy of Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the humor of the personal joke on the topic of how we're reckless be a new opportunity abroad?
At any rate, Johnny English's eye-catching, moving face is licensed to make mistakes again in a re-launched manner for a second time—the name further reflecting his sign that he is designed with wider humor for non-English speakers.
He is in fact a chicane detective who despite strange claims to interesting attractions reflects the qualities of Clouseau, the qualities of Mr Bean and the person responsible for one of the music of the Chariots of Fire scene at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in London 2012.
He was initially involved as a traveller and an international figure Atkinson was once involved in Barclaycard's now-forgotten T<0x56> broadcasts, leaving many if uninterested.
There's one or two things in this latest JE movie.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a jadi suit of armor and flats changing over his hat for a while.
Atkinson's talent in physical comedy was evident here, but the humor seems to be low-budget and unnecessary, huasan because "great" films such as 007 and Mission Impressionism include humor as part of it.
The comic appears to be aimed at children and not at adults and toasted at me Johnny English's unique adventures are not stunts and don't target how the comics of Atkinson's silent films as a Bean character.
The annual notion is now that Britain is in great trouble.
The web raider has managed to get into a secret British web site and expose the identity of all British spies out on the job and surprising the lobbyist at work - sadly it was a very simple task for Kevin Eldon.
In his final time as a magnificent prince he is faced with many oppositions and is already quite affected in political prominence: Emma Thompson does very well for her character comparable to Teresa May but the story doesn't help him portray these qualities.
His security advisers inform him that because each spy's identity has been disclosed, he must use a retired person.
And that means using Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a school teacher in a fancy school, but teaches informal lessons on how to be a secret detective: some good humor there, while English teaches detectives similar to the film School of Rock.
English is recaptured by Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, associated with the commander of the fleet, an exciting space where <0x56>icki Pepperdine is not involved should.
Thus the characters corresponding to Batman and Robin but destructively in the Secret Kingdom Service return to work and reconcile with Olga Kurylenko who plays as Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister seems to be more involved in the spying of his traveling master who claims to be able to solve all of Britain's technology problems: Jason <0x56>olta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their most enjoyable journey : they pretend to be hotel waiters, start a fire in a French fancy restaurant; they start a riot and enter without permission in a fancy boat <0x56>olta; and English causes a dash as she tries to use the tools of the Improved Reality to learn the details of the <0x56>olta.
All breaks are definitely removed for the final sequence, but regardless of the inspiration and turmoil that is being revived, there are so many characteristics of children's sessions in the film there.
<0x56>ery well-rounded.
And just as with other Johnny English films I had to think again: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
The Football Association denies that it has a plan for the British to work four days but be paid for five days.
The Football Association led by Jeremy Corbyn will consider a strict scheme in which the British will work four days in a row - but be paid five days.
The union allegedly wants corporate leaders to pay money saved through artificial intelligence (AI) to employees by giving them an extra day.
It will mean workers will grow up with three days of rest - but they will still go home with the same income.
Sources said that the idea "will fit" the party's economic agenda and plans to strengthen the country for workers.
Working four days a week has been supported by the Workers' Union Centre as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior source for the Football Association told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not be done immediately but the four working days are relative to the party's attitude in balancing the economy for workers and also the party's overall strategy for the sector.'
'The Football Party will not be the first to propose such an idea, the Green Party promised four working days a week during its 2017 campaign for the general election.
Ari hio is currently unsupported by all in the Football Association, however.
A spokesperson for the Football Association said: 'Four working days a week is not a party policy and has not been taken into account by the party.'
Chansela alternative John McDonnell used last week's Leba meeting to describe his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he had a determination to remove the authority from 'invisible executives' and 'self-employed' companies.
The Chansela alternative plan also means that current shareholders in water companies will not be able to refund all of their money because the Leba Government can make a 'substantial cut' on the grounds of recognized liability.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create Ownership Finances to provide 10<0x25> of the private firm's funds to employees, who will have a chance of getting an annual turnover of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy tells jogg of "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI investigation into the prosecution against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote regarding his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question as to whether the FBI's findings could change the thoughts of Republican senators to support them.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Senators. of Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI can find anything that could cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said towards the case, I said, I've spoken to Justice Kavanaugh.
"I called him after this happened, when the allegations came up, I said, 'Did you do it?'
He was stable, accurate."
However, Graham's vote seems to be irreversible.
"I've decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it will take very serious charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly declined," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford."
"And everyone involved couldn't prove it.
It's 36 years now.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, a music event that includes an impressive list of the stars singing as well as an equally interesting message; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizen's Festival will lead tens of thousands to go to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness for the event's true goal of ending poverty inherited by the year 20.
The World Citizens Festival, which stated in 2012 that it is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people facing directly against it.
In order to get a free event ticket (except if you would like to pay a <0x56>IP ticket), festival followers had to complete a series of activities, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending emails to a global leader, calling or any other effort to help increase awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how has the World Citizens' Festival been successful with the remaining 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concert tickets a real way to persuade people to push for action, or just another case of what is known as "only online activism" - people feel like they make a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, the World Citizens Festival says that it has leased over 19 million "inactions" from its supporters to different goals.
It says that these actions have pushed world leaders to announce promises and policies equivalent to <0x24>37 billion that will change lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group revealed 390 promises and announcements based on their actions, at least <0x24>10 billion already in circulation or donations.
The group estimates the funds available to date have directly impacted around 649 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and donors in the United Kingdom aiming to "help children reach their full potential," promising to donate 35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the help from the British government, donors, national governments, and Citizens of the World like you, we can make the social bullying of malnutrition just history," Commissioner of Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were completed in asking the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and better nutrition.
In response to a question in the <0x51>uestions and Answers section on his website asking "what makes you think we can end poverty that affected you?"
Citizens for the World Citizens' Festival responded: It will be a long and hard way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, it was with human rights activists and anti-racist groups in front of us, we're going to succeed, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the stars who will sing at the event in New York City, which hosts Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use Navy to "block" Russia's energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington may "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from being sold, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has said, as described by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's involvement in Syria—in particular, where it works at the invitation of a legitimate government—is an excuse to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason for them being the Middle East is to look for energy markets the way they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and strategies to deal with that.
"The United Nations has that capability, along with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are opened, and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure that their energy is not reaching the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the participants who attended the event organized by the League of Users Energy, a non-profit group which states that it represents the "voice of users of energy" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, and said that the countries are similar.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, in proportion, to consumption and oil exchange," he said, referring to Russia as "with little experience" and an economy based on coal oil.
The information comes at a time when the Trump administration has been on a mission to increase its natural gas sales to Europe and to replace Russia, which has been a very affordable option for European users.
Accordingly, Trump administration leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "proper" pipeline project of "Nord Stream 2," which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "slave" for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion, which aims to double the current capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is simply an economic project.
The Kremlin says that much of Washington's opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy is not appropriate as a tool to make pressure and that users should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has been condemned by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German agency in the sector, the German Industrial Union (BDI), has called on the United States to abstain from EU energy policy and bilateral treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem as the third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President <0x56>ladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "Will Look Deep" to Run for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she could "look deeper" if she ran for president after the election of representatives.
During a meeting at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and rehabilitate our corrupt government and which includes a woman in power," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I'll look into detail whether I'm going to run for president."
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city hall, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned within me about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been very vocal about his opposition to Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet he published on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
"A poll released on Thursday, however, showed with a large number of voters in the Warren area not feeling that he should run in 2020.
59<0x25> of voters "able" to vote in Massachusetts said the senator should not run for, according to the Suffolk University<0x2F>Boston Globe Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported a similar runoff.
The poll showed further support for former Governor Deval Patrick's nomination, with 38<0x25> supporting and 48<0x25> rejecting.
Other notable names of Democrats considered eligible to run include former <0x56>ice President Joe Biden and <0x56>ermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide before January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites traumatic trauma to Track Palin at Donald Trump meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being registered in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic abuse incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he comes back, I can understand other families that are going through the traumatic traumatic traumatic and some of the impact our soldiers are coming back to," he told an audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin cited the arresting action as "a matter of complication being avoided" and said that his son and other war veterans, "returns separately, comes back with a hard-fought ideology, returns wondering if there's any respect that they have for the astronauts and every other military partner, for his commitment to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic abuse of a woman and influencing the report of domestic abuse and possession of weapons while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, DC endorses new immigration policy
Eighteen states as well as the District of Columbia support legal opposition to a new U.S. policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing crime or domestic abuse.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a small friend-of-the-court report Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers in protest of policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace v. Sessions which was filed by the United States Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his lover "and his sons the gang members," persecuted him but U.S. officials refused his asylum application on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Lawyers for countries supporting Grace described the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which offer a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations facing problems of domestic crime and abuse groups.
A new asylum policy in the United States reversed the 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board which allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic abuse to be granted asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, state and international law."
"The state law requires that all asylum claims be determined according to the facts and specific circumstances of the claim, and the refusal violates that principle," said a friend-of-the-court statement.
More lawyers said in a report that policy prohibiting immigrants from entering negatively impacts the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide essential services."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer offer asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and criminal groups in June.
"A refuge is available to those who flee their country because of bullying or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular group of communities or political views," Sessions said in a June 11 announcement on the policy.
The asylum act was not meant to solve all the problems - even all the major problems - that people are faced with every day around the world.
Most rescue efforts in Palu as the number of disasters doubles in the race for survivors,
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It looks awful," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her influenza child at a rescue facility in the city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance brings the bodies.
Fresh water is rare."
"Dozens were seen returning to their damaged homes, taking wet equipment, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured while hospitals, damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, failed to control the number of patients.
Several of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had fractured his back and shoulder, when they left him outside Palu Army Hospital , where patients were being treated outside due to persistent lateral tremors.
Tears filled his eyes as he recited how a violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where they were with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I was squeezed in the rubble of the walls, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'discrimination' through 'propaganda'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in the U.S. magazine that illuminated the combined benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. Journalists to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's addition of a Chinese scholarship to the Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in the State of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 U.S. delegation's election, a claim that China has opposed.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections shows what U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's fast-paced campaign to push for China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to post ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently facing each other in a trade war that has led to an increase in the rate of tribute of individual goods.
China's resurgence early in business was designed to affect exporters from states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to UChina and former governor of Iowa, the leading exporter of agricultural products to UChina, said Beijing negatively impacted U.S. workers, farmers and traders.
In China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "it now reduces the bullying by posting propaganda ads on the free press."
"In distributing his propaganda, the Chinese government is using a method that has been promoted by the United States of free speech and free information by placing paid advertisements on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In comparison, in parts of newspapers on the streets in Beijing, you'll find very few voices offer opposition and you won't be able to see the realities and differing opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding the troubled economic goals of China, considering that the media are closely controlled by the Communist Party of China. "
He added that "one of China's most famous newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republican Separation Women <0x56>oters Towards a House of Representatives <0x56>ote Through the Kavanaugh Crisis, analyst Warn
With a majority of supporters defending Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual abuse, critics have warned that they will get negative results, particularly from women, during the election of representatives.
The sentiment surrounding this has been very high and many Republicans openly indicated that they wanted to continue with the vote.
Such things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he is concerned that last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to cool voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday — they won't forget it tomorrow and all of November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the MoveOn development group said on Friday, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they marched along the Senate highway while Republicans who control the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The influence and motivation of the Democrats has exceeded expectations", "Stu Rothenberg, an independent political commentator, told the news website.
"People say it's already reached a high point; that's true.
But it can be higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who when they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony that described sexual abuse against a Supreme Court appointee, critics said the negative results could follow if the Republicans continued to confirm.
"This has been a slush game for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about a committee vote or a final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be nominated, it's also about the way Republicans have dealt with this and how they treated him ," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, has said on the media.
However, Americans seem to have some division as to who to be trusted after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with many leaning towards Kavanaugh.
A new study from YouGov shows that 41<0x25> of participants were likely or perhaps believed in Ford's testimony, while 35<0x25> said they were or perhaps believed in Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38<0x25> said they thought Kavanaugh bluntly or perhaps lied during his testimony, while only 30<0x25> have said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford along with another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh persecuted him at the age of 17.
Ramirez says the Supreme Court's Selector revealed his secrets while they attended a ceremony while they were at school at Yale in the 1980s.
The Founder of the World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Web to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of World Wide Web, is launching a new business that will offer competition against Facebook, Amazon and Google
The technologist's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that is developed through the Berners-Lee Software platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and people who are allowed access permissions for comments.
In a special interview with Fast, Berners-Lee claimed that Inrupt's motive is to "rule the world."
"We should do it now," he said regarding the business.
"It's a historic moment."
Programs use Solid technology to allow people to create "personal data storage online" or POD.
It can include a contact list, a list of things to do, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Store, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on the same browser and at the same time.
And unique about personal data storage online is that only the user can access what kind of comments.
The company refers to this as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to company Managing Director John Bruce, is for the company to bring in the right resources, process and knowledge to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently includes Bruce of Berners-Lee, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the contractors assigned to create this project and a voluntary community of code developers.
From this week, technology artists around the world are able to create their own one-part programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team have not spoken to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to initiate a complete change in which all their business models will be integrated in one night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
"At a publication in the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial and environmental energy to help protect the integrity and quality of a new network created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee switched network when he founded the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has contributed more to the discussion of having a free website.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain a Member and Director of the World Wide Web, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Foundation.
"I have a wonderful hope in regards to this web show," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard <0x56>ann: Priest Who Won the <0x56>ictoria Cross Award during WW1
The only Church of England clergyman to win the <0x56>ictoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter has been celebrated in his town 100 years later.
Colonel Lutena the Reverend Bernard <0x56>ann won the award on 29 September 1918 at the Siege of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a target raid four days later and never realised that he had won the highest British military award.
The memorial stone has been revealed by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael <0x56>ann, stated that it is "a remarkable example" that the stone is especially revealed 100 years from his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Lutena <0x56>ann led his regiment along the Canal de Saint-<0x51>uentin "through thick fog and intense firing from the field and guns."
He later ran into the firing line and with "greater courage" he led the line forward before using a field gun alone and aiming three weapons.
Colonel Lieutenant <0x56>ann was killed by a German target raid on 4 October 1918 - more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael <0x56>ann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "acts that I know I can't reach but it's very interesting."
He and his brother Dr. James <0x56>ann also set the flower crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael <0x56>ann said he "was feeling very honored to participate in the parade" and added "the courage of the real hero is shown with support from a lot of people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but found Peppa Pig instead,
Consider this, you've waited all night to watch Bellator 206 only to be denied watching the main event.
Bili from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and was aired live all night in the United Kingdom via Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to get to know each other, viewers in the UK were left open mouths as the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Others were disappointed after staying awake to the early hours especially for fighting.
One fan on Twitter described changing and keeping children's cartoons as "some kind of terrible joke."
"It's a federal principle where when it came to 6 a.m. the content was inappropriate so it had to change programming to be for children," said Dave Schwartz, <0x56>ice president of Bellator's markets and communications, when asked about the drift."
""Peppa the Pig, "Yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said that they will go to work on their schedule to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the frequency, I think we can probably consider this," Coker said.
"But now it's 6 a.m. Sunday there and we can't take this into account until Sunday at our time, Monday at their time.
But we pay attention to it.
Believe me, when it changed there was a lot of messages being sent and it didn't grow good.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that in the future such a thing won't happen.
We'll put it in five fights instead of six - as usual - and we tried to make an effort for the fans but failed.
It's an unexpected situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'weak' because of his sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt miserable because of his sex throughout his growing up - but that gave him a life-long commitment to success.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize it until he joined high school then "I realized that not everyone is like me."
Speaking on a Radio 4 show at Desert Island Discs produced by Lauren Laverne, he says that he talked about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope."
He says that the move to parenthood made him more irresponsible for winning at the Olympics.
The producer of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has been out for a period due to illness.
Participating as an outcast in Laverne's first episode, Daley says that she felt "some bit less" than everyone her age because it "wasn't acceptable to love girls and boys."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of self-esteem and certain limitations, and feelings of alienation are things that have given me strength and ability to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally discovered his gender.
The double bronze medal contender for the Olympics has been a prominent member in LGBT support campaigns and was used for the opportunity to participate in Commonwealth Games in Australia in order to appeal to more countries not to consider same-sex sexuality a crime.
He said he showed up because he felt lucky to be able to live without effect and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said to fall in love with another man - an American filmmaker - Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "found unexpectedly."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years old to him, last year but said that the age gap has never been a major issue.
"When you go through a lot at a very young age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had gone through similar things.
The couple became parents in June, with one son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole attitude" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I just thought 'I need to win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things bigger than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
"His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not agree that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they still got their Olympic tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you can't go near the hio daddy row'," he said.
"I was holding her hand when she stopped breathing and had to stop breathing completely and die was what I believed she had failed," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had been lurking for the rest of my life - diving in front of a crowd of our people at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also encouraged his choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had given him a boost during the preparation of the Olympics and brought him into the spotlight.
Desert Island Discs episode aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 5:15 BST
Mickelson who has not been playing well is benched in the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his game so he won't reach the point unbeaten.
Mickelson, playing in the doubles event of the year and setting a record for 12th-inning play, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball game and a pair game.
Rather than being in the depth of the event, how often he was for the United States, this grand slam winner five times divided his day between being a fan and practicing a game in hopes of fixing his problem.
Never a leader even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old player is not a suitable choice for a game at Le Golf National, in which bad ball is repeatedly punished.
And if the field is not reason enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces British champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed with new player Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches this week.
If Americans, who are four points behind as they start a one-man 12 match, have a strong opposition, Mickelson's match can prove to be crucial.
Furyk showed courage in his man, not that he could say more.
"He fully understood the role he played today, he would shake hands and hug me and assure me he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's very brave in his ability.
He is a celebrity and has made significant contributions to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him play two matches.
I expected him to play more, but that's what happened and that's the way we thought we should focus on.
He wants to be out there playing, just like anybody else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most matches in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could be his last in playing the Ryder Cup which has never matched his personal record quality.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven uniforms, although Furyk said his presence brought some benefits to the team.
"He's funny, courageous, he likes to make fun of people and he's a good person to have him on the team," he explained.
"I think that the bud players were also happy to fight him also this week, which was interesting to see.
He has more contribution than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows leadership scores may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that great leadership entering the Ryder Cup final could turn into a tense journey.
Mden played his first match in 1997 at <0x56>alderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros took the lead with five points against the Americans but they finished with the game high, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead at <0x56>alderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at <0x56>alderrama, where we won, but very close," said Bjorn, having been filmed, after watching the 2018 Class win 5–3 on Friday and yesterday and leading 10–6 at Le Golf National.
So history implies to me and everyone on the team that the game is not over yet.
You're going to be more aggressive there tomorrow.
Go there and make sure you have done things the way they should.
This game isn't over until you get the score.
We have a goal and it's trying to win this tournament and there that's what we're aiming for.
I've said this all the time, I consider the 12 players who are on our team, but we know the quality of the opposing team - the best players in the world.
"Impressed with the way his players did on a hard field, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't be more optimistic about this.
Tomorrow is a very different day.
Tomorrow is a personal activity that you will decide and that is something different.
It's best to be out there with a partner when things are interesting, but when you're out there on your own, then you've been perfectly tested for your abilities as a golfer.
That's the message you need to tell players, it's acting on your best quality tomorrow.
Now, you let your partner go and act better independently, too.
"In contrast to Bjorn, opposing team captain Jim Furyk will hope his players will act better personally compared to when playing as teammates, with the exception of Jordan and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was involved in the famous games on the final day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before finishing in defeat as Europe gained "The Miracle of Medina."
"I remember every word," he said when he was told about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, brought his players together towards the final day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get a good start as it was at Brookline, as you saw at Medina.
When the pace runs in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those mid-range matches.
We organized our players efficiently and put people in a way that we felt favored, you know, we're trying to make a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in a high-profile match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the rest of the European team in the top half of the list.
"I went with this team in this order because I think it illuminates the whole journey," said Bjorn for his choice of players in a personal game.
A new German warship is being refitted
The newest German Navy ship was planned to be launched in 2014 to replace veteran ships serving in the Cold War, but will not be until at least next year due to poor systems and increased costs, media reported.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg type, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine quoted a military spokesman.
This ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but later delivery issues affected the fate of this major project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg type that the Navy commissioned in 2007 are coming in order to replace the Bremen class battleships.
It is known that they will include power-ups, reconnaissance and air-to-air and ship-to-ship decorating missiles as well as hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and arctic signals.
Other key components include organizations over time - it is possible to send the new ships for two years away from home.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the high-speed warships - which are said to allow Germany to target abroad - will already be obsolete when they go into service, explained Die Zeit.
The F125 became popular last year, when the German Navy refused to launch the ship and put it back at the Blohm <0x26> <0x56>oss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had restored the ship to shipbuilders after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for recycling, but the German press referred to a number of reasons for "significant software flaws and hulls" that made the ship less important should it be sent to war.
The shortage in programming was an important factor because the Baden-Wuerttemberg would be powered by 120 crew - only half of the crew on the old ships of Bremen.
It also emerged that the ship has extra weight which amablo reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to improve it in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship of 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar ships used by the Germans in the Second Great War.
Aside from faulty frames, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - is also a major issue.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion euros (<0x24>3.6 billion) - from the initial cost of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems facing new ships are becoming especially important due to the warning that the capability of German shipping has dropped.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy is in fact "going to miss ships capable of being sent to war."
The official said that the issue had long been ignored, because the old ships were removed but no alternative ships were issued.
He complained that none of the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg type would be used by the Navy.
The Nationa Trust maintains the secret life of bats
A new regional study in the Scottish Highlands aims to explain how bats use the environment in their food hunting.
You expect these results will provide a new explanation for the behaviour of these unique jumping animals and help guide future conservation practices.
A study of scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will follow the pipistrelles and soprano bat as well as the eared bat and Daubenton bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed in key locations around the area to monitor the bat's activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct telephone surveys using hand sanitizers.
Sound analysis for the expertise of all records will confirm the frequency of bat sounds and the species doing so.
Environmental map and reports will be presented to create a detailed-image environment for their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant at NTS, expects the results to show which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each bat species.
This explanation will help determine the benefits of environmental management work such as the creation of pasture and the best ways to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of batsmen in Scotland and England has declined sharply over the past century.
They come under threat from building work and development that affects nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lights can also cause hazards, as well as insecticides and some chemical products of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats aren't exactly blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more important than their eyes if they arrive are a point of catching prey.
They use a complex local sonar technique to target insects and obstacles in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks 76,000 hectares of land across the country, considers bats very carefully.
It has provided training to ten trained professionals, who occasionally perform surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescue bats.
The organisation has even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the property of Threadave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson has said the property is the best location for the batsmen.
"Here in Threadhave we have a large area for batsmen," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the beautiful surroundings.
But there's a lot about bats yet unknown, so the work we do here and in other resources will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.
"He stresses the importance of looking at the presence of bats before making organizations inside the property because it is possible for unconscious destruction you can kill up to 400 young bats and bats, and possibly destroy the entire population of bats in the area.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer at the Populist Conservation Association, has urged the public to intervene and help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats because many of our species we don't know how many numbers remain."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while lawyers plan to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has said the rape allegations against him are "false news," saying that people "want to advertise themselves" under his name.
His lawyers have planned to want the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been charged with raping an American woman , named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las <0x56>egas in 2009.
He is alleged to have later paid him <0x24>375,000 to be silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on Instagram's Live <0x56>ideo for 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, lies, "five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or says on camera."
"They want to promote themselves by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for mentioning my name, but it's part of the work.
I'm happy and I'm okay," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they said are "unacceptable reports of accusations in the private area," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in accordance with the seriousness of the violations, which may be one of the greatest violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a chimney at the Hotel and Kasino's Palms in Las <0x56>egas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the background, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that by "99<0x25>" he is a "good" man dropped by "one percent."
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex, but it was voluntary.
Mayorga also says that she went to report to the police and was photographed of her injuries at the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court compensation because she felt "fear of revenge" and was worried about "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now ready to pay compensation because she is continuing to be mentally disturbed by the incident.
Ronaldo was due to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the allegations, and this season moved to Italian champions Juve when he was bought for <0xC2><0xA3>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' for losing automakers
Britain 'will regret forever' for losing its position as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was inciting "anxiety" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a contract it could suspend production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr Clark
Japanese automaker said the impact of the border delays if no contract after Brexit will lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Auris Toyota and Avensis - produced around 150,000 cars last year where 90<0x25> were exported to the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU in March we will see a halt to production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have expressed fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on how the border industry will operate, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main issues relate to what manufacturers say are the risks of distribution in the event that there is no agreement after Brexit.
Toyota production is carried out on a "time-efficient" basis, with equipment arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU on prescribed vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the border that the sector says can cause delays and shortages of materials.
It is impossible for Toyota to wait more one day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus production will be suspended.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plan for Checkers' future relations with the EU is "prepared correctly to avoid the investigation at the border."
"We need to have a plan.We want to have a better deal that will allow not only the success at the moment but also to take the opportunity that exists," he told BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue to get a distribution that has been successful in the past."
Toyota could not say how long the production stopped, but for a long time, warned that additional costs would reduce factory competition and ultimately job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite Union at the plant, said his associates are becoming increasingly concerned: "In my experience as soon as these jobs leave they never return.
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place an accurate and credible plan of our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, White House says
The high-profile meeting of Donald Trump and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "stopped for another week" with a fight involving high court appointee Brett Kavanaugh continuing, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser David Mueller, who investigates electoral interference with Russia, the relationship between Trump's aides and Russia and the possibility of obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump seeks a job as deputy attorney general and thus jeopardizes Mueller's independence, it has spurred months of Washington speculation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, while it was said he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at a United Nations conference in New York, was announced to take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "liked" not to dismiss Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with a case in the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, causing delays in the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "A date for that has not been set, it could be this week, I can see it being pushed back for another week considering what it is like in the supreme court.
But we will see what it will be and inform the media.
"Other journalists could object to the remark: Sanders has not hosted a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Local Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of information is not due to the impartiality of T<0x56> journalists to "appear attention," although he said: "I don't want to disagree with the fact that they attract attention."
He then said that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president makes more <0x51>uestions and Answers sessions than any previous president," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We have looked at the figures."
"The press release will continue, Sanders said, but "if the media has a chance to ask him direct questions to the president of the United States, that's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it many times and you've seen us do it a lot more in the past few weeks and that this will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
"Trump responds repeatedly to being asked questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or meetings with foreign leaders.
Meetings with the media on its own are rare.
In New York this week the president probably pointed out why, by giving a random speech and sometimes showing up in front of gathered journalists.
Health minister writes to EU workers at the Scottish Health Organisation about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to European Union workers working for Health Scotland expressing gratitude for the country and expecting they will remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter while remaining six months to the UK to withdraw from the EU.
The Scottish Government is committed to reaching the cost of the application for a residential status for EU citizens working on its public services.
In his letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer, talks between the UK and the EU about withdrawal have continued, towards the decisions expected this autumn.
But the British Government is also improving its provisions for the impossible state of solution.
I know this is a very unhappy time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to mention how much I appreciate the contribution of every worker, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues from all over the European Union and beyond, bring valuable experience and knowledge that strengthens and improves the health care work, and helps patients and the community we serve.
Scotland is your home completely and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes Emergency Surgery After Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers guard Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a game they lost 31–27 on Saturday against the <0x56>anderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that an injury had occurred shortly before the break.
"He just came to the edge and he just grabbed it," Reed said.
Staff and medical doctors gave Abercrombie oxygen in the banks before placing her on the stretcher for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSM<0x56> in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been completed for surgery at <0x56>anderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no explanation as to the type<0x2F> extent of pain yet" and the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first grade student, resides in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which increased the total tackles in the season to 18.
Outside buyers will be reimbursed for the top stamp duty if they buy in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be reimbursed for top stamp duty purchases property in the UK with additional funds being used to help the homeless under the new Tory scheme
The move aims to balance the success of Corbyn's move to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tribute will be paid to those who do not pay their tribute in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to get up to <0x24>120 million annually - to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be reimbursed for the top stamp duty if they buy property in the UK - and additional funds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to balance the gains Jeremy Corbyn has made to attract young voters with a promise to provide affordable housing and target those with higher incomes.
An increase in stamp tribute will be charged to individuals and businesses that do not pay their tribute in the UK, with additional funds being used to improve the government's plan to combat the status of housing for the homeless.
The additional fees - which include current stamp duty, including high rates set two years ago on second-hand housing and rental housing - could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the move will give it up to <0x24>120 million annually.
An estimated 13<0x25> of new buildings in London are bought by non-UK residents, leading to an increase in prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to buy their first home.
Many wealthy parts of the country - especially in the capital - have become "demonstrating towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending more time abroad.
The new policy comes a week after Boris Johnson asked for a discount in the stamp tribute to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of setting property prices high by buying real estate and failing to build it and asked Mrs. May to withdraw from renting to repair the "disgrace in the housing sector" of the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of interesting developments in settlement reform, including tax control would threaten the state of eviction "without error".
He also wants to give councilors more power to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I wanted to volunteer to revive the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means changing our broken residential sector.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a new life.
However, it can't be fair that it's easy for people who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes at the same price as UK hard-working residents.
For so many people the dream of housing ownership has been so far removed and there is so much chance of homelessness."
Jack Ross: 'At least my determination is to be the boss of Scots'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "final" is to be Scotland's manager at some point.'
The Scotsman, aged 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-Eastern club, now in third place in the First League, three points from above.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this season after helping St Mirren return to the Scottish League the previous season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I managed to get a country game for Team B and it got to that point," Ross told BBC Sport Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and always admired that thing.
However, the opportunity will only come, if I succeed in the management of the club."
"Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he had no fear of following such famous names in such a big club, after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment will be measured by 'how can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and equipment at this club, it should definitely be in the English Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy job to return, but I'd just like to see myself as successful here if I could get the club back up there."
"Ross has only three years since he started managerial career, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as an apprentice at the Hearts club.
He then helped Alloa from relegation to third place and changed St Mirren from relegation to winning the League cup the following season.
And Ross says he feels so much better than he was when playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably the real way," he recalled, of taking over Alloa's management.
"I certainly believed management was better suited to me, more than playing.
It seems strange because I did it right, I got the income from playing and enjoying the conditions of the highest level.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you should do every week.
I'm still going through that in terms of stress and work pressure but I feel the management is right.
I always wanted to be an administrator and now I'm doing it, I feel much better inside me in my whole adult life."

The best time for getting alcohol is 11.30 p.m. Saturday, a study has found
Summer temperatures have increased drinking in struggling British bars but have added more pressure to restaurants.
The bar had an increase of 2.7<0x25> in July - but drinking in restaurants decreased to 4.8<0x25>, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's business consultant, which included the figures, said: "The sun's continued and Britain's more temporary participation in the World Cup means July followed the same pattern as the previous month of June, while the bars experienced a 2.8<0x25> increase, except that restaurants had an even greater impact.
A 1.8<0x25> drop in the restaurant business in June fell even further in July.
Drinking beers did better with restaurants having discounts.
Food bars were affected by the summer, though not as restaurant operators.
Apparently people just want to go out and get a drink.
Controlled bars had a sales increase of 6.6<0x25> for the month with food items falling by three percent."
"Paul Newman, a critic of entertainment and hospitality at the RSM said: "These results continue in the direction we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of large-scale social events or games remain the biggest factors affecting sales in the domestic export market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8<0x25> per year will be very painful considering the ongoing cost pressures.
The long summer has come at the worst time for food service providers and we'll have to wait if the average temperature we got August will change things for the better."
"The overall growth of sales in bars and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7<0x25> in July, compared to a decline in brand products.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they often hide from their parents
One in five children - some even 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, research exposes
A study for 20,000 high school students has shown growth in the pages "InstaSign"
The statement has led to fears that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they own a "super" account to show parents
One in five children - some even 11 years old - create fake social media accounts that they keep secrets from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown rapid growth in the account "Insta fake" - a reference to a website to share Instagram image.
The story has raised fears that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they create a "super" account to show parents, while they also own other private ones.
One mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's website found a young man urging others to "be married."
The Digital Awareness UK study and the British Association of Head Teachers of Independent Schools (HMC), found 40<0x25> of 11- to 18-year-olds had two accounts and half of them agreed to keep an account privately.
HMC chief executive Mike Buchanan said: "It concerns that many young people are being tested in creating online areas that parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics as an inactive director at the general meeting of the federal board's annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly regarded in the community of Scotland, England and the world athletics community and we are confident athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from participating on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm willing to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
An American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter dash at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta out of a total of his four Olympic golds and is now an analyst at the BBC, failed to walk after suffering a lack of blood flow.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago today I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said it will only be known in time if I can recover and to what extent.
It's been a difficult task to fully recover, to learn again how to walk and today to make a comeback!
Thanks for the comforting message!"
Announcement of breast pump Comparison of mother and cow results Different views online
The breast pump company has split comments online using an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milk cows.
To mark the launch of what is known as "the quietest breast pump in the world," the tech company Elvie released a funny music video advertisement to showcase the freedom that the new pump offers to breastfeeding mothers.
The four real mothers play denizens in a barn filled with cow's food with a song that includes lyrics such as: "Well, I struggle, but you don't see the tail" and "If you haven't realized these aren't crystals are my breasts."
The song continues: "Fuck it out, fuck it out, I feed the kids, fuck it out, fuck it out, I fuck my women."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 times of viewing and hundreds of views, the video has received mixed reviews from viewers and many say it reflects the "fear" of the milk sector.
"A very bad decision by using a cow to advertise this product.
If we need to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless their children are removed immediately after birth," one wrote.
Elvie's breast pump goes very well into the breastfeeding syringe (Elvie<0x2F>Mother)
Another said: "It haunts the mother and the child consciously.
But yes why don't you use them to advertise the breast pump to mothers who are left with their babies?"
Another person added: "An unrealistic declaration."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she felt the song was "hilarious."
I think this is a very strong idea.
I'd get one if I was still breastfeeding.
Gravity made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is silly but I understand it.
This is a highly creative product," one wrote.
Another person said: "This is a fun ad that focuses on a mother who milks her (often in a work place or in a toilet) and feels like a "milk."
"This is not an announcement praising or condemning the dairy sector."
At the end of the video a group of women show that they have all been playing with pumps on their siren.
The campaign concept comes from the knowledge that many women who use pumps say they feel like cows.
Elvie's pump however, is completely silent, has no wire or tube and fits perfectly into the lactating syringe and gives women freedom by moving, holding their babies and even going out while milking them.
Ana Balarin, associate and ECD teacher at Mother said: "Elvie's album is a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and inspiring launch.
Given the ambiguity between describing women and dairy we wanted to put the act of pumping the breasts and all its challenges into supervision, while expressing in a fun and interesting way the sense of freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time an Elvie pump has hit the headlines.
During Fashion Week in London, a mother of two walked the stage to the architect Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Immigrants smuggled to Tent Camp in Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased even though the number of passes has not changed, because the politics and strict policies offered by the Trump administration have made it difficult to keep children for donors.
Traditionally, many donors have been unregistered immigrants and are afraid to risk their ability to remain in the country by continuing to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that possible donors and other household adults would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Mathew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested several people who had asked to fund children alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70<0x25> of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"Nearly 80<0x25> of the people who are donors or family members are here illegally and most of them are criminal aliens.
. So we keep track of those people," Mr. Albence said.
In the process of cutting children more quickly, leaders introduced new laws that would require some to be presented to the court within a month of the arrest, rather than 60 days, which was customary previously, according to housing workers.
Most will be submitted via conference call via video, instead of a person present, to appeal their case to the legal status of the immigration judge.
Those who will be considered unfit for aid will be quickly returned to their country.
The longer the child remains in detention the more likely it is to be panic and anxiety or frustration, which can cause a sense of trauma or escape attempts, according to resident staff and reports that have emerged from the system several months ago.
Lawyers said these issues are escalating in major centres such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's poor condition are ignored, due to its large size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to provide them with emotional support or last-minute interaction with friends could increase whether or not many are already going through it.
Syria tells U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, though it has now reached eight years of war in the country.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops are in Syria illegally, under the pretext of counter-terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They should leave immediately and unconditionally," he told the meeting.
Moualem asserted that the "war on terror was nearly complete" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy war until we save all areas of Syria" from all terrorist groups and "any foreign presence."
"The UN has nearly 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a multi-ethnic country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were favorable for them to return and blamed the "western states" for "spreading false fear" which has caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and human organizations to facilitate the return process," he said.
"They're putting politics on the human issue."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no building support for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has foiled attacks by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region, where three million people live.
Moualem however insisted that the agreement had a "clear time" and expressed hope that the military action would help the militias including fighters from the Nusra Front affiliated with Al-<0x51>aeda, who would be "finished."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to organize the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Moualem stipulated the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the function of the panel should be controlled to "examine the current constitutional clauses," and warned against intervention.
The Reasons Trump Won't Re-Elect for the Second Term
in that logic, Mr. Trump will again win the 2020 election unless viewers love development and change many hope that the removal of power-sharing and scandals will end his presidency early.
And being of course "the greatest end of the presidency ever!"
Currently, there are no signs of observer fatigue.
Since 2014, primetime ratings have doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly three to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen and MSNBC station show "The Rachel Maddow Show" leads in cable television ratings to 3.5 million viewers on primetime news.
"These are things that draw people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC drama series "Designated Survivor," about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol's president's main arsenal.
Nell Scovell, a former humorist and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Flaw Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalls a taxi trip in Boston prior to the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? He asked.
"He said," because he always makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is an entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, a story from Washington may later decide the case of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited with the health of the world economy.
Appearance is just a luxury for viewers who have plenty of opportunities that they can afford.
However, the issue goes beyond a conscious citizen as you find yourself in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "the long one" in the sources of his book "Fear," a <0x24>15,000 jacket of designer's skin by Paul Manafort ("a thick, puffy outfit, "Washington Post said to the results"
I, never, never will ever see Super Mario in the same way again.
"A part of what he does and makes it look like a fantasy show is that he's giving you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and architect of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump show changing characters and scenes every day (starting a confrontation in the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

When I approached Mr. Fleiss this week, there was an 80 degree sun outside his house on the north side of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't leave there, not if Brett Kavanaugh was about to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's fate unknown.
"I remember when we were doing all these amazing shows in the past and people were saying,"This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside funds overflow into the closest election of Parliamentary representatives
It is not surprising that 17 Pennsylvania districts have experienced financial flooding, due to a resurgence of congressional districts finding two current leaders fighting for the same seat.
Pittsburg's newly-formed district has Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won a seat in another district in the final special election of the spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, the current leader representing Pennsylvania's former 12th congressional district, which is popularized by 17 new.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that former districts had been drawn to suit the Republicans.
Candidate in 17 new ridings has established financial competition in the philanthropic circles of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was a popular name in Pennsylvania after a small victory in a special election that was widely followed in March's 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States Imagined Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Stopped
Diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and little pressure to do so from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a good meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos <0x56>arela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until allies slotted the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials in the State Department decided to remove the main U.S. diplomatic message from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama regarding "the latest cases of not recognising Taiwan again," the department's spokesman, Heather Nauert, said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which made <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial aid and restrictions on visa applications, would have a profound effect on the country's Central American population and unemployment and high rates of murder.
As domestic conferences continue, North American and Central American leaders proposed a high level conference on security and economic well-being and followed a similar conference last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent immigrants from moving towards the United States.
But in mid-September, the top administration leaders made it clear that they wanted the meeting to go ahead and effectively end any disciplinary consideration for El Salvador.
<0x56>ice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the summit, scheduled for mid-October, with a sign of the importance the administration has placed on the convention, diplomats said.
And three U.S. diplomats returned anonymously in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a sharp new message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman Mr. Bolton refused to provide information about the details of the debate given by three U.S. leaders, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions without revealing an identity.
Their views were confirmed by an external critic close to the regime and he also discussed without revealing identity.
A Study of History
The next thing to fall may be Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, where there is now substantial evidence in the public eye.
Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in attacking our elections.
If Congress changes control, Mr. Trump will find himself facing cases of accountability in the legislature, just as he prepares to go again and invoke votes to voters and perhaps ultimately judges of his co-chairs.
That's a lot of things that are now just saying they're just possible and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's removal from power is inevitable -- nor for leaders like him in Europe.
There are options that must be made by each side of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight is going on.
In 1938, German officials were willing to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the Western powers refused to support and support the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to escape the years of the murder that followed.
The focus of history revolves around such changes and the stability of the course of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a number of changes at present.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who is in control of the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad mood since the newspaper reported that last year, he suggested recording the president in secret and said he is not worthy of being in the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' recall is incorrect.
"What will we be able to answer if the new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is not complete and fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, we'll be able to vote in the election of representatives of Congress who won't be able to make Mr. Trump consider righteousness?
If we fail these measurements, democracy will face the risk of long-term decline.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi government that was at one point using my diplomatic house.
He survived, moved to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika symbol.
With that as my heritage, how can I lose a positive outlook on our future life?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans has high hopes ahead of match against Rapid <0x56>ienna
Rangers host Rapid <0x56>ienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after a good uniform in Spain against <0x56>illarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good chance of qualifying from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury kept Graham Dorrans from playing his first match this season to a 2–2 draw against <0x56>illarreal but he believes Rangers could use the result to set up a lot of points.
"It was a good mark for us because <0x56>illarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We got into the game believing we could get something and we came back with one score.
Maybe we could get more at the end but, in general, uniforms were probably the same result.
They were probably best in the first half and we went in the second half better.
Thursday's entry, is another great night in Europe.
Hopefully, we can score all three points but it'll be a tough game because they got good results in their last game but, with our fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and get good results.
Last year was very hard, between everything that happened to my injury and the change in the club but there's a good feeling about this place now.
The squad is the same and the players are very happy; your training is the same.
We expect, we can push now, forget the previous season and succeed."
Women lack sleep due to fear of savings for retirement
Although it was true that the study participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, a few people were talking to their families about this.
About half of people in a nationwide survey said they were talking to their loved ones about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10<0x25> said they talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to care about them, but they don't take steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's insurance business.
This is how one starts.
Talking to your boyfriend and children: you can't provide your family with services if you don't make your wishes known well ahead of time.
Consult with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive services, because those choices can be an important factor in determining cost.
Share your financial advisor: your counselor can also help you find a way to pay the bills.
Your philanthropic options for long-term care may include a long-term insurance policy, a life insurance policy for a securities value chain to address these costs or independent of your wealth - the best you have money.
Use your legal documents: Block your legal cases in advance.
Get a medical service representative document so that you can select the person you believe to be in charge of your medical service and make sure that professionals comply with your requirements if you are unable to communicate.
Also, they would include a lawyer's contribution to your money.
You should choose the person you believe to make financial decisions for you and guarantee your expenses are paid on time.
Don't forget the details: think your old parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
You have the ability to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Put the details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only are the money involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is therapy?
Who's going to handle the dog?
Set the plan accordingly."

Indonesia Earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed by a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia's Palu on Friday, leaders said and the number of disasters expected to rise.
With communication interrupted, aid officials have not been able to obtain any information from the Donggala administration, a region north of Palu which is close to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake disaster.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, it is at the end of a narrow strip on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was marking the 40th anniversary of the tsunami.
Donggala is an administrative region located on the coast of over 300 km (180 mi) northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Temporary government, the administrative area under the province, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the economic base of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, coastal and Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the course of 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is home to the Pacific Ring of Fire and is repeatedly hit by an earthquake.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of the dead came from Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island , off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, the island of majority of the population in Indonesia causing a tsunami that broke off the southern coast, killing around 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters which destroyed several villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regime in Aceh and caused damage and panic as people recalled the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused at this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: A massive earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded for a time.
Sarah Palin's Chief Son Arrested on Domestic Abuse Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic abuse, preventing a report of domestic abuse and refusing to be arrested, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a girlfriend attempted to call the police to report the alleged crime, she picked up her phone.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su Pre Trial Center and on a <0x24>500 non-security bond, reported KTUU.
He arrived at the Court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, of course" when asked for his pleas, the network reported.

He has also been charged with Class B offenses, penalties are to be closed all day with a fine of <0xC2><0xA3>2,000.
It is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of persecuting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report on the attacks.
The case is now before the Alaska War veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, obstructing a report of domestic crime and possessing weapons while drunk in connection with the incident.
Her boyfriend had said that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups in 2016 after linking her child's violent behavior to the traumatic traumatic event PTSD based on her ministry in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake Tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake occurred on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks broke down and the death toll is expected to rise in the future.

Hundreds of people had gathered at a coastal festival in the town of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
State prosecutors seek rare death penalty for alleged terrorist attacks in New York City
State prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipanov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare penalty that has not been imposed in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipanov, 30, is alleged to have used a Home Depot rental car to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking pedestrians and cyclists down his path in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saibiov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to a statement of intent to seek the death penalty, issued in the Southern District of New York.
All of these offenses carry the possibility of a death sentence, according to a court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a panel of state judges gave a verdict of 22 charges to Saipanov which included eight murder charges in aid of fraud, usually used by state prosecutors in cases of organized crime and traffic-related violence and destruction charges.
The attacks needed to be "prepared and well prepared," the prosecutors said, describing Saibiov's action as "disgusting, cruel and misleading."
"Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipanov caused injury, damage, and loss to Diego's family and friends Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnu's report
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York implemented capital punishment charges.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was implemented in the New York state trial was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were punished with death after being convicted of conspiring to perform a fantasies for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by death by being placed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saikov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed a lack of remorse days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saikov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attacks after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to accusations.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has denied 22 criminal charges.
David Patton, one of the country's public defenders representing Saipanov, said that they are "broken" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting guilty pleas for life in prison without the possibility of release will only increase it due to incidents like this for all involved," Patton said.
Saikov's representative team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARGE should be put in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to 'encourage the people's army' today during a protest at a Tory rally.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should 'feel warm' from anti-EU citizens - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be in charge of talks with the EU.
Conservative party MP Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain 'should have been out' by now if Mr Farage became Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Ms. May faces is the challenge of bringing together her heavily divided side which became apparent when the Tory supporters of the Remain joined the separate anti-Brexit protests in the town.
The prime minister is working towards implementing his plan of negotiations with Checkers amid criticism from supporters of Brexit, supporters of the Left and the European Union.
His allies insisted that he would continue with the move to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite objections – and forced anti-EU and the Leba party to choose between its plan and the 'confusion'.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted 'to give up the Chequers plan'.
He suggested that Mr Farage was to be made a partner and given the task of dialogue with Brussels.
‘If he had control, we'd be ready out now,' he said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: 'I will support Brexit but we need to forget the Checkers deal.'
Expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: 'We didn't fight in the world war to sleep under others.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone denied the proposals that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain totally untrue.'
'Tory MP who supports Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in protest and told reporters: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The plan for Checkers is not very popular with the general public, the Opposition cannot vote for it, it is not liked by our party and our activists who actually go to the streets and help us be elected.
Please stop the Checkers program and start listening to people.'
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: 'The Prime Ministers retain their positions as they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told a meeting that politicians should be made 'feeling warm' if they are about to betray a decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'This is about the matter of loyalty between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we can't let him do that.'
In a message to the excited crowd he added: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, feel warm.
'We are encouraging an army of the people of this country which will give us victory in Brexit and which will never rest until we are free, on our own, to be a magnificent Britain.'
Meanwhile, Supporters to Remain continued the march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Many activists showed signs written in Tories against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Leba MP Mr Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they encountered in the party program when the meeting was opened.
'These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technologies of the UK and the European Union to respect the laws of another, for a problem-free border, for free trade without borders in Ayaland,' he added.
'Cause it's just a lie.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'look into detail' intent to run for president,
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she plans to "look deeper into the intentions of running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about his fate during a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against GOP Representative Geoff Diehl, who was chairman of the 2016 Trump Campaigns Coalition in Massachusetts.
He has been in the midst of rumors that he can face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters using the town hall design since Trump's election.
The attendee asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that involves a woman in the upper seat."
Man arrested in connection with Sims shooting murder of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, 5 a.m. ET at a press conference.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the person who appeared on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to protect the nephew when he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted to being at the scene of the incident, possession of the weapon and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in the parish Police Department of Baton Rouge East.
A 6-foot by 6-foot player raised in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games and started in 10 games in the previous season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nearly wins the World Cup after team instructions give him victory over Sebastian <0x56>ettel
It was clear from when <0x56>altteri Bottas retired before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the Mercedes team instructions will make a major contribution to the race.
From the start, Bottas got a good start and almost completely abandoned Hamilton as he defended his place in the first two rounds and invited <0x56>ettel to attack his partner.
<0x56>ettel took the lead first and let Hamilton follow the trajectory on the tail of the team, something that was to contribute greatly.
Mercedes made one round and were behind <0x56>ettel, but Hamilton stepped past the front after a tight race which caused the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free from the closing effect after doing so twice in the third round.
Max <0x56>erstappen started in the starting lineup and was in seventh place for the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead for most of the race and held on and then passed Kimi Raikkonen to fourth.
He finally reached his relegation zone in the 14th round and failed to accelerate in the remaining eight rounds with Raikkonen taking fourth place.
It was a hard day because <0x56>altteri did a wonderful job all week long and showed a maturity allowing me to pass.
The team has done a unique job taking first and second place," Hamilton said.
That was a <0x56>ery Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in a meeting Saturday regarding his insistence that she did not disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West <0x56>irginia, the president did not directly discuss the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead saying that what is going on in the Senate showed that people were "soft, ugly and false."
"One thing that can happen with a good thing that has been going on a few days ago in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bored and ugly and lying," he said.
"When you look at the offerings and expose them then they say" oh, I didn't. I didn't.
I didn't."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you expose it?
You remember his answer ... did you expose the script - "oh, oh, what?
Oh no!
I didn't expose it.
"Well, wait a minute.
Is it we exposed ... No, we didn't expose," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was used a letter describing the charges against Kavanaugh and Ford in July and was exposed in early September - but Feinstein denied that it came from his office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Dr Ford. I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported
"He asked me to keep it in secret and I kept it in secrecy as he asked."
But his nominations did not seem to have been well received by the president, who commented during a Saturday night meeting: "I'll tell you this, that was a terrible body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's elector, who has been charged with sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations to their benefit.
"They have decided to take power in any way.
You see boredom, evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they've affected for power and control," Mediaite reported the President saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5–3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two touchdowns for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars redeemed a losing match against Belfast Giants on Friday in the Elite League by winning the match 5–3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early lead through two touchdowns from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised the hosts before Dwyer gave the Giants the lead again.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two-goals gave them the win.
It was the third losing match of the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time they had met in a season between the teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 9:35 after getting the ball from Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford gave Beauvillier the ball to score the second goal four minutes later.
In the first inning, Sullivan put the hosts up by 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave the score to Cownie 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead before the first intermission when he scored his second goal late in the first period.
The locals lined up again and Bouchard again equalised them in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran played together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second period and ensure the victory by a fifth goal in the final.
The Giants, who have now lost the previous four matches, will be the hosts of Millton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies while ensuring Hundreds of Travellers in the Airplane can avoid Earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he lost his life while ensuring that the plane carrying hundreds of people left safely.
More than 800 people have died and more have been missing after a major earthquake occurred on the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Later tremors continue to occur in the area and many are trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his comrades escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to escape from his position in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He was left to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the road at the time, was able to fly safely.
He then flew the control tower of the traversal when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision was able to save hundreds of people, ABC News of Australia reported.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are breaking to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, the leadership fears that the death toll could reach thousands and the country's disaster reduction agency has said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is minimal.
"The number is believed to be still increasing as many bodies were still trapped under the falls while challenging to reach many," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Six-meter high waves have destroyed Palu which will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide support and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings up bodies.
Fresh water is rare.
Small markets are broken everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is working to help the victims but we don't know how things are.
This is already a disaster, but the situation may be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all activities related to the deportation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was struck earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Airplane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one person has been missing after a plane crash into a lagoon.
The airline that owns a crashed plane in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia has now said that one person is not available, having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely rescued when the plane sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that by Saturday afternoon, he could not find out when he was a man.
The agency said it is cooperating with regional leadership, hospitals and investigators in an attempt to find him.
The agency did not immediately respond to requests for further details regarding passengers, such as their age or nationality.
Area boats helped rescue passengers and other crew after the plane crashed into water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The leaders said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The agency said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and both were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the series of events remain unknown.
The agency and the U.S. Navy both said the aircraft landed in the lagoon just before reaching the route.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane had hit water on the road.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to walk through the water reaching the waist through the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He said the flight attendants were scared and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to improve the docks closely also assisted them in rescuing them with a breathboat to transport people to land before the aircraft sank in approximately 30 metres (100 ft)
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows 111 people have died in crashes registered by PNG in the last two decades but none were involved with Air Niugini.
The critic shows a record of events on the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution unit finished describing her case on Saturday in a repeat trial in which a man accused of stabbing a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He showed a panel of judges how he used cell phone records to bring together the activities of the 29-year-old defendant, <0x51>uinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the disaster.
Rowlett said he received area data from several mobile phones which indicated Tellis had Chambers on the evening of his death, contrary to his earlier claims, Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed his cell phone was with Chambers' when he said he had a friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford took a stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said they were in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my car was Nashville."
"Another inconsistent statement is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for just two weeks before his death.
Mobile phone records indicate that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted text messages and comments of Chambers' communications from his phone.
"He totally wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be referred to a panel of judges later that day.

Someone else in black?!
New York home minister accuses couple of being fired after message "racist"
A housekeeper from New York accuses the couple of firing him on grounds of discrimination after he received a message that did not belong to him from a mother who was complaining that he was "just another black man."
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the allegations to "disgusting."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed concern after discovering that the child's new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was a black man upon the arrival of her first day of work in 2016.
"HAPANAAAA WOMAN," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After discovering his mistake, Plasco—Flaxman with "anxiety" fired Ms. Maurice, saying that their outgoing minister, of African-American descent, had done a bad job and that instead he was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day of work and then returned to Uber's home.
Now, Maurice charges the couple with compensation in connection with the dismissal and wants a compensation of <0x24>350 a day for the sixth month, for work to live and work, though without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not fit to do the same actions," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have denied claims that they are racist, saying that it was Maurice's job to stop the work that grew the right move, fearing they could no longer trust him after he had wronged her.
"'My wife had sent her a message that she didn't intend'.
He's not racist.
We're not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But can you put your children in the hands of someone you have wronged, even if it's wrong?
Your baby?
Tell the truth."
Comparing the accusations to "a fraud," Plasco said it was only two months after his wife had a child and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to sue someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do," the banker said.
Although the legal case is still in progress, a public opinion court has accused the couple on social media, and attacked their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not be biased regarding the talking bear, a new letter indicates
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born in bone time after this book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone reading for the first time before publication.
It's very exciting to know about Paddington's great achievements."
Saying his father, who worked as a camera attendant at the BBC before getting the urge to write a children's book from a little bear toy, would have no negative feelings for his work being rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "happy and sad" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, who he describes as "the most important member of our family," added that his father greatly enjoyed his success.
"He was a man with few words and he wasn't proud," he said.
"But because Paddington was so important to him, it's like having a successful child: you're proud even though it's not your actions.
I think he saw Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his architecture and his ideas, he was always praising Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to move on the phone.
After discovering that her daughter had been rushed to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad used to call from time to time and say that the situation was terrible and he wasn't expected to live," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad to tell me he was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tash , I love you so much, my son.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given him in order for his spirit to continue to beat were slowly ending in power in his system.
He had died a while before and this point was just his system to stop working.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to give myself up.
"Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - without them knowing what she was going through.
"No one knew, he said.
"I was tilting my head and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to describe, but it's time I was on the plane when I felt very sorry for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved him."
Women mourn card holders to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who lost loved ones by suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on the Welsh bridge with powerful messages and phone numbers that people can call.
His son Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from hypertension and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel how I feel every day," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her child was a very promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him with his smile.
Everyone said his smile pleased everyone."
However, he quit his job before he died, because he was "a dark place."
In 2014, the brother of Tyler, who was 11 years old, was the first to find his brother after his suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm always worried that this will affect others."
Mrs. Davis created a card, "to let people know that there are people out there who can go and talk to them, even if they're a friend.
Don't be silent - you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old lover, not long after her mother's death.
He didn't say that he feels bad or is suffering from thoughts," he said.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at the bottom of Christmas Day — when the kids were opening their gifts he didn't want to look at them with eyes or communicate."
He said his death led to them finding it to be, but they should have struggled to keep going: "It puts a hole in the family.
It depresses us.
But we must all go forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's conviction staggers as FBI begins investigation
"I thought, if we could get something like what he asked for - a study with a duration, a climax of magnitude - maybe we could bring a little unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling" due to the complexity of the mutiny.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to time.
The election of representatives takes place only five weeks from now, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans are overwhelmingly defeated, then they will be very weak in their efforts to keep the person they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling the Senators, persuading them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr.Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was secretary to Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI issues its report?
There will be voting in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats work.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the uniform and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee population 'downs' under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's coalition ministry, said that there were 1,127 refugees last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the highest control on the border between North Korea and China and the high levels of fines imposed on smuggling businesses were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
Many of the refugees from the North are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many flee through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Multi-Military Zone (popular DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China considers refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often reintegrates them.
Relations between the North and the South - literally still in the war - have changed dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on nuclear disarmament talks that had stopped.
The incident came after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, agreed on broad terms to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under that condition, there is no way we will remove nuclear weapons as the first," Mr Ri said in an address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi refers to Brett Kavanaugh as "uncontrollable," and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh is an "uncontrollable" person and said he has so much emotion it is inappropriate to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I thought that if it was a woman who ever did that way, they would say 'you can't control yourself,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh flatly denied the allegations that he abused Dak Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
At the time of his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and dying of breath talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also publicly denounced the Democrats on the committee, citing the charges against him as "disgusting and scheduled to damage his reputation" organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he discriminated against the Democrats.
"I think he's withdrawing for those words and how he condemned the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi did not refuse when asked if he would attempt to remove Kavanaugh from office if he is confirmed and if the Democrats will be majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this - if he does not tell the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he is not only fit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Priceless Service Act or Roe's case against Wade, because he is said to be a conservative judge.
In his prosecution of evidence, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether he could reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for an angry, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Not that's wonderful,'" said Pelosi.
And Women Should Use It.
It's a good eulogy of bitters, months and years of more rage and he can't remove it without crying.
"We're crying when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's normal, do you?"
She continued,"I was very helped by a woman who was active somewhere, who said she was also crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she could tell someone who talked to her,"You might think I'm sad because I cried.
I'm upset."
Then he went on to explain me.
And I thought that was a good idea."
"The tears are allowed as a way to get rid of rage because they are fundamentally incomprehensible.
One of my most memorable memories from my early career, is an office full of men, where I immediately found myself crying in a tactless rage, was caught in the back of the neck by a big lady - a boss who was always a little scared of me - who pulled me up to the stairs.
"Don't let them see that you're crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy because they're with you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found with an extramarital affair on board a boat known as Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Ms. Schroeder, she became disillusioned and saw no reason not to bid for the presidency.
"It wasn't a decision that worked well," he told me while laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed is one more.
Somebody referred to this as the classic "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign time grew so far gone, he was back in fundraiser and thus vowed that he would not enter the race unless he raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a war he was losing.
He found that some of his followers who contributed <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 to men would only give him <0xC2><0xA3>250.
"Do they think that pigeons I get a discount?" he wondered.
When he made his speech announcing that he could not launch an official campaign, he was filled with gratitude to the people who helped him, confusion with the system that made it very difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates and anger from discrimination of sex - until he ran out of breath.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the media reacted to the incident.
"You'd think the Kleenex company were my commercial sponsors.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my grave?
"Did he cry?")
How the trade war between the United States and China can benefit Beijing
The initial sounds in the trade war between the United States and China were very disturbing and although the war will not end soon, the distinction between countries may be beneficial to Beijing for a long time, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year for charging important Chinese sales including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most impactful diversity began this week with a new tribute affecting 200 billion (150 billion pounds) worth of goods, charging half of all US imports from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, recently imposed a five to ten percent tax on <0x24>60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to feed the U.S. moves, and the second-largest country of the economy does not seem to give up anytime soon.
Making Washington change the move means you have to accept terms, but publicly accepting US pressure would be a great embarrassment for <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game well, the hardships of the trade war against the United States can help China over time by reducing the mutual support between the two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create an environment that can begin a shift in the economy in any of its countries and is far more dangerous than others have previously thought," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who is focusing on Asia at the new U.S. Security Advisory Center.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria has said that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by a long-term war of over seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al- Moualem said conditions in the country are stabilizing.
"Today the situation is more stable and safer due to the progress made in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to repair terrorist-damaged areas to restore normality.
All conditions now exist for the voluntary return of refugees to the country in which they had to flee due to terrorism and economic measures that affected their daily lives and careers.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian nationals have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government will welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he insisted that they do not want assistance on the terms or assistance from countries that funded the terrorism.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again as Danish team captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had a difficult time throughout the tournament, hit his first ball in the water on the 16th hole of the 3rd hole, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian player Molinari played well in all his turns and became 1 player in 4 for 5–0–0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest listed player in the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world number one listed player, Dustin Johnson, was defeated 2 and 1 by England's Ian Poulter who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
A player in the eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player in the tournament with 25.5 points in his games.
"It's not normal for me to cry but today I'm overwhelmed.
It's been a challenging year.
Thanks to Thomas for appointing and trusting me.
I'm very happy, I'm glad to win the cup again.
The important thing is the team and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia who was full of emotion after the European victory.
He transfers roles to fellow countryman John Ram who defeated American star Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a one-man game on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud, to defeat Tiger Woods, I was watching him as a junior," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13–2–3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising figure from one of the highest scorers ever, having won 14 titles and only the second to do so after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was overwhelmed all weekend to keep the ball part of the grass except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a very high-scoring game in all competitions.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after the low game of his squad, "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
There were times this morning when we put a lot of challenges to the European team.
We fought.
Many honours for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, work with our PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going forward.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to give a compliment.
They controlled us."
