>>cmn_Hant<< I don't know if you realize that most of the goods imported into this country from Central America are duty-free.
However, 80% of our merchandise is subject to tariffs in Central American countries and we treat you.
I don't think that's fair; it's obviously unfair.
How we treat you, how you treat us.

Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in by the New Interim Electoral Commission (CEP) consisting of 9 members.
This is the fifth time in four years that Martelly has been elected to the Haitian Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP).
Last month, the President’s Committee recommended the resignation of the previous CEP, which was part of a move to push the country toward new electoral measures.
The committee was Martelly’s response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protests have been sparked by the failure of some elections to take place on time, sometimes escalating into violence.

There is no additional transportation available, and there are no stops on the train at Wembley, and no parking or transfer facilities on the ground.
>>cmn_Hant<< Fearing a lack of transportation, the game may be forced to be played behind closed doors without a supporter of the team.
>>cmn_Hant<< On Thursday, a study published in the journal Science stated that a new species of bird formed in the Galapagos Archipelago, Ecuador.
>>cmn_Hant<< Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species only evolved for two generations due to the breeding between the brave and exotic cactus-billed grouse in the endemic Darwin finches, although it was thought that the process would take longer.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. Can be curled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into filaments for winding and knitting. It can also be punched or crushed into flakes.
>>cmn_Hant<< It can be made very thin and glued to other metals, and because it reaches so thin, it can sometimes be used to decorate hand-drawn drawings in books known as "painted manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can use red kale juice to make an indicator.
>>cmn_Hant<< The color of cabbage juice will vary according to the acid-base nature of the chemical.
The pH value is expressed as the number of hydrogen (H) ions in the chemical being measured.
>>cmn_Hant<< Hydrogen ions are protons that lose electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
>>cmn_Hant<< Stir the two dry powders to mix them and then knead them into a ball with a clean wet hand.
>>cmn_Hant<< The moisture in your hands reacts with the outer layer, which creates a shell-like layer that feels very interesting.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have flush toilets in almost every household connected to sophisticated sewage treatment systems.
>>cmn_Hant<< Remains of sewage system were found in houses in the cities of Crete and Santorini Minos, Greece.
In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of a mixed public bathroom.
You'll use satellites when you call someone miles away.
>>cmn_Hant<< When the satellite in space received the call, it almost immediately reflected back.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts certain light and vision.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet high is needed.
Wheels have changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest contribution to us is making our transportation easier.
>>cmn_Hant<< With it, we had trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
>>cmn_Hant<< Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits, antelopes to deer.
>>cmn_Hant<< Eventually, there are many small cats (including scattered pet cats) that feed on a much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
>>cmn_Hant<< The secret of their success is the niche concept, where each cat is responsible for a special task that prevents them from competing with other cats.
>>cmn_Hant<< The lion is the most obvious cat in the grouping property and lives in a large group called the lion population.
>>cmn_Hant<< The lion population consists of one to three only related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
>>cmn_Hant<< As sisters and daughters in large families, females are usually closely related to each other.
Lions behave very similar to wolves or dogs. These animals behave surprisingly similar to lions (but unlike other large cats), and these behaviors are very deadly for their prey.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tigers are all-around athletes, and it climbs (although not very strong), swims, jumps far, and pulls up to five times the strength of a human Hercules.
Tigers and lions, leopards and jaguars belong to the same species.
>>cmn_Hant<< The roar of a tiger is not as deep as the roar of a lion, but more like an angry roaring word.
Leopard cats like to eat small animals. If conditions allow, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds.
>>cmn_Hant<< Scientists believe that puma cats track and look for animals to prey on the ground by smelling and sniffing prey tracks.
They have strong night vision, can see clearly in the dark, and the action is secret.
>>cmn_Hant<< When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from their primary populations (such as when they cross mountains and rivers, or when they reach a new island so easily that they cannot return), they usually find themselves in a different environment than before.
>>cmn_Hant<< This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so new populations will need different features or adaptability to become a strong competitor, not those they needed before.
>>cmn_Hant<< The original populations have not changed at all, they still need to be adapted to the environment as before.
>>cmn_Hant<< Over time, new populations began to adapt to new environments, and they began to become less and less similar to other populations.
>>cmn_Hant<< After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will eventually look very different, so that the two cannot be called the same species.
>>cmn_Hant<< We call this process "species formation", i.e. the formation of new species. Species formation is an inevitable result of evolution and an extremely important part of evolution.
>>cmn_Hant<< Plants can make oxygen from human inhalation and absorb carbon dioxide from human exhalation.
Plants extract nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make houses from plants, we make clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals can't survive.
>>cmn_Hant<< Cang Long was the top predator of that era, and feared nothing but his kind.
Its long jaw is covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and there is a row on the upper jaw. This means that anything that meets it has no escape.
Its tongue may be bifurcated and we’re not sure. Its food includes turtles, large fish, other cicadas, and even cannibals.
>>cmn_Hant<< It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex are not its rivals.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although most of the Roman food is common to us, they do have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails and a rodent called hazel-sleeping rats.
>>cmn_Hant<< Another difference is that the poor and women eat in chairs, while the rich like to gather for banquets and lie down to eat.
>>cmn_Hant<< Food introduced into Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later could not have appeared in the ancient Roman diet.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes and cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever eaten turkey.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities and treated it as the residence of the deity.
Priests meet God’s needs through rituals and festivals.
>>cmn_Hant<< Each temple has a courtyard open to the outside, and an inner temple accessible only by priests.
>>cmn_Hant<< Some of the special towers, in the shape of pyramids, are known as the gold-shaped shrines and were built as part of the temple.
>>cmn_Hant<< The top of the tower is God's special holy place.
>>cmn_Hant<< In the warmer climate of the Middle East, houses are not much more important.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cook in the yard; the store is actually an open counter facing the street.

>>cmn_Hant<< If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the back of the Declaration of Independence would draw a treasure map.
Although the back of this document wrote something but is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" are written on the back of the document and are inverted.
While no one can determine who the author is, this large parchment document (which measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) is said to be rolled up and stored when it was first written.
So it's probably just added as a label.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Normandy landings and subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These French made a peace deal with the Germans in 1940, not against the aggressors, but with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the attack became known as Operation Dragoon.
>>cmn_Hant<< In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
>>cmn_Hant<< Civilization is a single culture shared by people (society) who live together and work cooperatively.
>>cmn_Hant<< The term "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis" (meaning "citizen"), which is related to the Latin "civis" (meaning "citizen") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "city-state"), which also defines the scale of society in some way.
Civilizational culture means knowledge passed down through generations, cultural footprints lingering, and culture can spread fairly.
>>cmn_Hant<< Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and are not treated as decent civilizations.
>>cmn_Hant<< During the War of Independence, thirteen states originally formed a weak central government under the "Federal Regulations" (Congress was its only component).
>>cmn_Hant<< Congress has no power to tax, and since there is no state executive or judicial branch, Congress can only rely on the state government to enforce all bills, which in turn are often inconsistent.
>>cmn_Hant<< It also has no power to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
>>cmn_Hant<< These provisions must be amended with the unanimous consent of all states, who treat the central government so lightly that their state representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, having won the Football World Cup in 2006.
>>cmn_Hant<< Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
>>cmn_Hant<< Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, where Italians will compete in international competitions and Olympic games.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu Island), Japan is the seventh largest island nation in the world.
Japan is often referred to geologically as "the Islands".
The West’s knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
>>cmn_Hant<< In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan region, began to change the way indigenous peoples produce food and hired Chinese workers to work on their rice and sucrose plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) controlled western and northern coastal Taiwan, and in 1885, the Qing Empire declared a province of Taiwan.
In 1895, after the defeat of the Sino-Japanese War (1894â€“1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Maguan, ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the House of Three Windows.
>>cmn_Hant<< To give visitors a better understanding of the original appearance of the complex, most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was repaired and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is the 35mm format, which was the dominant movie size at the end of the film era.
>>cmn_Hant<< Production still exists today, but more importantly its aspect ratio is applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual dimensions of the 35mm format are 36mm wide and 24mm high, so the format is actually a bit confusing.
Thus, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are the same or quite close to this aspect ratio.
>>cmn_Hant<< The often misused and ridiculed triad is a simple method of guidance when creating dynamic, and also keeps the image in order.
>>cmn_Hant<< It states that the most effective position for the subject is the intersection of lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
>>cmn_Hant<< During this period in European history, the already wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was closely supervised.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although languages and customs vary across Europe, for over a thousand years Christianity has linked them together.
From king to civilian, its power affects everyone.
>>cmn_Hant<< One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's IMF was created specifically for that purpose.
>>cmn_Hant<< The centralism of the church existed in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to begin to question whether they had complied with this creed.
>>cmn_Hant<< Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to impose a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy has proven effective, although such a blockade violates international law that has been generally accepted under several international agreements over the past two centuries.
>>cmn_Hant<< The United Kingdom mined in international waters to prevent any ship from entering the entire sea, even to neutral country vessels.
>>cmn_Hant<< Due to limited response to this strategy, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitude of most citizens was pacifist and separatist.
>>cmn_Hant<< After witnessing the brutality of the First World War, all nations aspired to avoid repeating themselves.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job at the Edison Company in New York City.

>>cmn_Hant<< Different periods of Chinese antiquity were characterized; every period or family in China in charge was a distinct dynasty.
Similarly, the period of change is a period of instability in small states, the most famous of which is the period of 60 years, between two generations of change in the Han dynasty.
>>cmn_Hant<< During these periods of unrest, there was a fierce war between the rulers for the throne.
Thousands of people died fighting for the highest power in Xi'an's luxurious palaces.
>>cmn_Hant<< There are many social and political influences, such as the use of measurement units, the transition from despotism to republicanism, nationalism, the belief that the state does not belong to the sole ruler but to the people.
>>cmn_Hant<< In addition, after the Revolution, the office was open to all men for application, which made the most ambitious and most successful people the opportunity to fly Huang Tengda.
>>cmn_Hant<< The same is true of the army, because the rank is no longer based on rank, but on talent.
>>cmn_Hant<< The French Revolution also inspired many other countries' oppressed working class to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was very interested in earthly life. He used to meditate in a cave called Hira on Mount Noor.
>>cmn_Hant<< The cave itself not only survived the time test but also brought an extremely vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave sits on a hilltop in the north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even knowing it's there.
In the caves, you can hardly see or hear outside sights and sounds.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only building in the Seven Wonders that still stands.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Great Pyramid was a masterpiece of the Egyptians in the third century BC, and it was one of the many large pyramids that paid homage to the late Pharaoh.
>>cmn_Hant<< The plateau of Giza in the Valley of Death in Egypt (i.e. the "Giza Pyramids") includes several pyramids (where the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small graves, several temples and large sphinxes.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh of Khufu and several smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The "bow" symbol is like the letter V, and the "bow" symbol is like a nail or missing a square at the bottom.
>>cmn_Hant<< Up refers to pushing the bow from the top and down refers to pulling the bow from the root of the bow (i.e. where the hand holds the bow).
>>cmn_Hant<< The upper bow usually makes a softer sound, while the lower bow makes a stronger, more firm sound.
>>cmn_Hant<< Feel free to mark your own with a pencil, but remember that printed notes are musically meaningful, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two children (11-year-old Marie Theresa and 4-year-old Louis Charles), as well as the king's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were driven back from Versailles by a group of market women.
>>cmn_Hant<< They returned to Paris in a carriage, and a crowd surrounded them, shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen.
>>cmn_Hant<< In the presence of the frightened Queen, a mob once waved the head of a royal guard, who was killed at the Palace of Versailles.
>>cmn_Hant<< American imperialism's war expenditure during the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
>>cmn_Hant<< They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime for most expenses, and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
>>cmn_Hant<< Of course, long-term exploitation of the high profits of the Filipino people became a basic gain of American imperialism.
>>cmn_Hant<< To understand the Templars, one must understand the background that led to the establishment of the Templars.
The era of events is often referred to as the medieval period of European history, i.e. the 11, 12 and 13th centuries (A.D. 1000-1300).
The medieval period was preceded by the early Middle Ages and followed by the late Middle Ages, which are customarily thought to end around the end of the late Middle Ages around 1500.
>>cmn_Hant<< Technological determinism is a term that covers many kinds of ideas in practice, including the theory of technological propulsion, the theory of technological necessity, and a strict definition—that human destiny is driven by the logic behind it and its performance in technology associated with the laws of science.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most interpretations of technological determinism include both general ideas: first, that the development of technology itself largely outweighs cultural or political influences, and second, that technology in turn will have an intrinsic "effect" on society that is not subject to social conditions.
For example, one might say, cars necessarily promote road.
>>cmn_Hant<< However, a national road network was set up for only a few cars, which was not economically feasible, so a new mode of production came into being in order to reduce the cost of ownership of the car.
>>cmn_Hant<< Higher Volkswagen holdings also lead to higher rates of road traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of new medical technologies used to repair injuries and injuries.
Romanticism has a strong cultural determinism. It comes from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
>>cmn_Hant<< In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time, geography-related customs and cultures emerge, which, because of their harmony with the places in society, are much better than arbitraryly imposed laws.
>>cmn_Hant<< Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of the European feudal era.
Its reputation as a luxury center began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
>>cmn_Hant<< Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the gifts brought upon the return of the Crusaders, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine market.
>>cmn_Hant<< It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style peaked in the 10th - 11th centuries to the 14th century.
>>cmn_Hant<< Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slow cultural exchange, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
>>cmn_Hant<< As the Middle Ages advanced towards the end, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their style.One of the greatest advances of the time was the crusaders, when people began tethering their clothes with buttons.
>>cmn_Hant<< Subsistence farming is the agricultural activity that is carried out to produce food that can only meet the needs of agriculturalists and their families.
>>cmn_Hant<< Subsistence farming is a simple and usually organic system that maximizes yields by utilizing locally preserved seeds within the ecoregion, combined with crop rotations or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in self-sufficient agricultural production, which is still true in many developing countries.
>>cmn_Hant<< Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel they are ignored by social standards, and subcultures develop a sense of identity between them.
>>cmn_Hant<< Given the age, race, class, location and/or gender differences of members, subcultures may be distinctive.
>>cmn_Hant<< The traits that make subcultures different may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography or a variety of factors.
>>cmn_Hant<< Members of sub-cultural groups often symbolically use unique styles of behavior to indicate their membership, including fashion clothing, manners and slang.
>>cmn_Hant<< To illustrate the importance of socialization, one of the most common methods is to exploit the cases of a few unlucky children who, due to neglect, encounter misfortune or are intentionally abused, have not socialized with the help of adults in the growing up process.
>>cmn_Hant<< Such a child is called a "wild child", meaning a wild child.Some wild children are forbidden by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to parents' refusal to accept that the child has an intellectual or physical serious defect.
>>cmn_Hant<< Wild children may experience severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or left home.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is said that others were raised by animals; some live alone in the wild.
>>cmn_Hant<< If a wolf child is raised entirely by a non-human animal, its behavior (to the extent permitted by physical conditions) will be very similar to that animal, such as showing fear or indifference to humans.
>>cmn_Hant<< While project learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding learning goes a step further.
>>cmn_Hant<< Stent-based teaching is not a learning method, but a means of assisting people who have just learned to use new computer programs or start new projects.
Stent-based teaching can be done online or offline, in other words, a form of stent-based teaching, like the paper clip assistant in Microsoft Office.

>>cmn_Hant<< Children are fostered for various reasons, for neglected, abused, and even blackmailed.
>>cmn_Hant<< No child should grow up in an environment where there is no upbringing, no care, no education, but things go against.
We think foster care is safe for them.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
>>cmn_Hant<< The foster care system should provide all the necessities that its native family lacks.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
>>cmn_Hant<< The distinctive features of the Internet add extra dimensions to its use and satisfaction.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, "learning" and "communication" are considered important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In studying audience reactions to websites, Amy and McDermott (1998) also cited "individual engagement" and "continuous relationships" as new motivational factors.
>>cmn_Hant<< The use of video brought significant discoveries for elucidating microexpressions (face movements lasting several milliseconds).
>>cmn_Hant<< Specifically, it is said that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his paper, "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out that those who are unable to understand language due to brain damage are still able to accurately judge whether or not a speaker is sincere.
>>cmn_Hant<< He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior may be a common skill among animals such as domestic dogs.
>>cmn_Hant<< Research in the twentieth century showed that there were two libraries of genetic variation: explicit and implicit.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mutations add new gene variants, while selection removes them from the pool of expressed gene variants.
>>cmn_Hant<< Due to separation and reorganization, the variation changes back and forth between two libraries in each generation.
>>cmn_Hant<< On the savanna, primates have a human-like digestive system, and it is difficult for existing plant resources to meet the needs of primates for amino acids.
>>cmn_Hant<< In addition, failure to do this can have serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
>>cmn_Hant<< The most readily available plant-based resources should be proteins in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have a hard time digesting this protein unless it is cooked.
>>cmn_Hant<< In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
>>cmn_Hant<< In summary, we should not be surprised if our ancestors' approach to solving the "protein problem" is no different than the one used in today's chimpanzees on the savanna.
>>cmn_Hant<< Sleep disruption refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
>>cmn_Hant<< This is easy to do, using a relatively quiet alarm clock that lets you wake up without being fully awakened.
>>cmn_Hant<< If you find yourself resetting the alarm during sleep, you can place the alarm on the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
>>cmn_Hant<< Other biorhythmic-based options include drinking large amounts of liquids (especially water or tea—known to be beneficial for urine effects) before bedtime, forcing yourself to piss.
>>cmn_Hant<< The level of inner calm in a person is the opposite of the level of physical and mental tension.
The less stress, the more positive the vitality. Everyone has the potential to find absolute calm and satisfaction.
>>cmn_Hant<< The only hindrance to achieving it is our own tension and negativity.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes methods of Kundalini yoga, meditation and universal love.
>>cmn_Hant<< In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (initiation energy) is awakened through yoga posture, breathing exercises, reading and visual image.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is day yoga. By visualizing different deities, purifying energy channels, activating chanculos, reaching the epiphany.
As the war ended, institutional, procedural, and cultural conflicts divided the two countries.
>>cmn_Hant<< Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
The war continued for 40 years, with proxy troops fighting in real combat on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish line had been breached and the only hope left was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and reorganize the army.
However, these plans were abandoned almost overnight, after the invasion of eastern Poland by more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops and establishing positions in Belarus and Ukraine, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
>>cmn_Hant<< To date, shipping is the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
>>cmn_Hant<< Traditionally, the Navy's mission was to ensure that the state maintained the ability to transport personnel and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport their personnel and goods.
A most notable modern example is the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II.
Meanwhile, the German navy, which is dominated by U-boats, tried to intercept the shipment.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have conquered Britain.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time in Iran's Zagros Mountains about 1 million years ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, eating and using their milk, meat, fur and skin.
>>cmn_Hant<< Domestic goats are usually grazed in groups in the mountains or other pastures, they are usually cared for by herders (mostly children or teenagers), who are similar to the more widely known herders.These grazing methods are still in use today.
Britain built a freight lane as early as the 16th century.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although the Mara railcars were only assembled from parallel planks, at the time, they were slightly bumpy roads, which allowed the pulling horse to run faster and pull more.
However, people gradually realize that if the rails are put on the rails, the rails will be more stable and effective.
>>cmn_Hant<< This became common practice, but iron flakes would worsen the wear of wooden horse wheels.
Eventually, the wooden wheel was replaced by an iron wheel. In 1767, the first all-iron track was introduced.
Two million years ago, with the advent of Homo Erectus, humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors had no habit of walking upright.
Bipedal specialization was found in the fossils of australopithecines between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus of Chad may have walked on both legs as early as 7 million years ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< We can start living greener, join environmental movements, and even become environmental activists to some extent reduce future disasters.
But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and eradicate it.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is clear that due to human scientific and technological progress, the world has changed considerably, while overpopulation and human extravagant lifestyles have made the problem worse.
>>cmn_Hant<< The handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary-General Charles Thomson, received approval from the Continental Congress on July 4, and was then sent to the John Dunlap Printing House a few blocks away for printing.
Between 150 and 200 copies were printed overnight, which is now known as the Dunlap broadsides.
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6 and Washington read out the letter to his troops in New York on July 9 and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The remaining 25 copies of the Dunlap broadsides are the earliest surviving versions of the document.
>>cmn_Hant<< Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and have survived to this day, what we call "birds".
Many think they're not dinosaurs because they're feathered.
But birds have many similarities to dinosaurs.
Their feet are scales and claws, spawning and walking like a T. rex.
>>cmn_Hant<< Today, almost all computers put into use are based on information that processes binary coding.
>>cmn_Hant<< Binary numbers can only take up one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary numbers, i.e. "bits" in computer terminology.
>>cmn_Hant<< In vivo poisoning may not appear immediately, and symptoms such as vomiting are common, so no immediate diagnosis can be made.
>>cmn_Hant<< The most powerful indicator of ingestion of poisons may be a container that is opened on the spot, containing drugs or household toxic chemicals.
Check poison labels for specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the term "bug" to formalize this type of insect.
>>cmn_Hant<< The term derives from familiarity with bedbugs, an insect that is very adapted to parasitic humans.
>>cmn_Hant<< Both the hunted and the bedbugs are nesting insects, adapted to live in a host's nest or housing.
In all regions of the United States, there are about 40 million cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that has become a major neurological disease for young people.
>>cmn_Hant<< Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve).
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
>>cmn_Hant<< A couple may decide not to give birth for their own benefit or for the benefit of their children.
These couples may make adoption plans for their children.
>>cmn_Hant<< During the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their rights as parents so that another couple can raise their children.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods.
Experiments are not the only way to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
>>cmn_Hant<< Naturalists and philosophers pay attention to classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
>>cmn_Hant<< Aristotle's views on issues in all scientific fields (including psychology) were accepted one by one.
>>cmn_Hant<< With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West separated itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
>>cmn_Hant<< Many of the physiological and behavioral rhythms observed by researchers are very often dependent on the endogenous cycle produced through the biological clock and its existence.
This rhythm is recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
>>cmn_Hant<< A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating device that lasts for a period of free-running, even without external cues.
Hershey and Chase’s experiment is one of the main indications that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, one with radiophosphorus-labeled phage DNA, and one with radiosulfur-labeled phage protein.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mutations produce a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are reproductive line cells.
>>cmn_Hant<< Only mutations in reproductive cells are inherited to children, while mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts tourists who are interested in nature.
Activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birding, visiting parks and research ecosystems.
For example, visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive away from small towns to work.
>>cmn_Hant<< In this dynamic traffic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supported by a private car-based transportation system.
Today, science shows that this massive carbon economy can no longer stabilize the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everybody's part of society, they use the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
>>cmn_Hant<< In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about similar levels of water quality or bridge collapse.
Why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers incompetent?
>>cmn_Hant<< Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interaction between them.
>>cmn_Hant<< Regrettably, it is difficult to study traffic because 100% definite predictions of the driver's behavior cannot be made.
>>cmn_Hant<< Fortunately, the driver's behavior tends to be within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic flow tends to have a certain reasonable consistency that can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship is established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help planning, designing and operating road facilities.
Flying abilities make them easier to avoid enemies and more effective in finding food and mates.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most insects have an advantage and can fold their wings backward along the body.
This gives them more room to evade predators.
>>cmn_Hant<< Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and ticks.
>>cmn_Hant<< Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus once said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
>>cmn_Hant<< Some people think he's right, but there are also many who disagree; they think the solar system is orbiting around Earth, and so is the Sun (even other stars).
That’s because the earth doesn’t feel moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world, and its water volume is more than 8 times that of the second largest.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections up to six miles wide.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of all rivers in the world.
The Amazon River mainline is 6387 km (3980 mi) long. The river comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the grand scale and high construction techniques of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
>>cmn_Hant<< The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period marveled at the monuments of their predecessors that were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in legal and official communications.
>>cmn_Hant<< Italian is also the language used daily by most people working in the country, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
>>cmn_Hant<< All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
>>cmn_Hant<< Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, copper have been known to people since ancient times, as these elements can all be found in nature in their natural form and are easier to mine using primitive tools.
>>cmn_Hant<< Philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that anything is made up of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air and fire.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is more like the four states of matter (in order not to break up): solids, liquids, gases and plasmas, but he also proposed theories that think they will transform into new matter and make up what we see.
Alloys are basically made of two or more metals. Don’t forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
>>cmn_Hant<< Elements such as calcium, potassium belong to metals, silver and gold are of course also metals.
>>cmn_Hant<< There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements (e.g. carbon).
>>cmn_Hant<< Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
>>cmn_Hant<< Atoms are so tiny that the full stop at the end of the sentence can hold trillions of atoms.
Thus, a pencil becomes the heart of many.
>>cmn_Hant<< Regrettably, with the emergence of new writing styles, pencils became less and less used.
People now write on computer screens.
One can only guess how the keyboard ends.
>>cmn_Hant<< The fission atomic bomb works as follows: it takes energy to bring one atomic nucleus together with many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a clunky little cart up a mountain.
>>cmn_Hant<< Some atoms contain unstable atomic nuclei, which means that they are likely to split with little or no stimulation.
>>cmn_Hant<< The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust.The outer layer of the Moon is called the Earth's crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
>>cmn_Hant<< The crust below the dark surface is thinner and the crust thicker under the high ground.
>>cmn_Hant<< Because the Earth's crust is thinner, there may be more shade on the near side, and lava may rise more easily to the surface.
>>cmn_Hant<< At the heart of motivational content theory is the search for identified or interested factors.
>>cmn_Hant<< These theories suggest that certain needs and/or desires are internalized when people mature to a certain extent into adulthood.
>>cmn_Hant<< These theories study why some people want to do what they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
>>cmn_Hant<< Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start leading past colleagues, there are two behaviors: in one case, they try to maintain “intimacy” with team members.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is difficult for managers of this type to make unpopular decisions, and there are difficulties in executing disciplinary measures, performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and holding them accountable.
>>cmn_Hant<< In another extreme case, the person becomes an individual that is very different from before, feeling that he/she must change everything the team does and take the results as their own.
After all, leaders are ultimately responsible for team success.
This behavior often causes disagreements between leaders and others.
>>cmn_Hant<< Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as contact points.
>>cmn_Hant<< They tend to have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may meet for different time zone arrangements, which local management may not understand.
The existence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique part of the virtual team.
"Invisible Team" means the management team to which each member reports. It sets standards for all members.
Why does an organization take so long to build?
>>cmn_Hant<< Creativity and ingenuity occur when all available resources are effectively utilized between functional departments of an organization.
>>cmn_Hant<< As a result, an organization in the process of working together to overcome obstacles often brings new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
>>cmn_Hant<< Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and conduct organized learning.
"Angel" (2006) explains the continuum scheme as a way to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical methods of cognitive research.
>>cmn_Hant<< Correlation between brain pathology and behavior can support the research of scientists.
>>cmn_Hant<< We have long known that different types of brain injury, trauma, lesions and tumors can affect human behavior and lead to certain changes in mental function.
>>cmn_Hant<< The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study the structure and working processes of the brain, which have never been seen before.
>>cmn_Hant<< This provides us with a lot of information and materials for building simulation models that help us understand the process of brain functioning.
>>cmn_Hant<< Artificial intelligence has a very strong science fiction color, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, studying machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, and handwriting recognition.
All these become independent disciplines, focusing on real-life problems.
>>cmn_Hant<< AI systems are now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, and some home computers and video game software applications already have built-in AI systems.
Field trips are an important part of any teaching activity. Typically, teachers will gladly take students to places where buses cannot reach.
Virtual field trips are high-tech solutions. Students can watch museum artifacts in class, visit aquariums, or enjoy fine art.
>>cmn_Hant<< Virtually sharing field trips is also a good way to review the itinerary and share experiences with later classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their state capital trip.Â The site is redesigned every year, but older versions are saved online and used as scrapbooks.
Although students start blogging, grammar and spelling are often sloppy, and readers usually change that.
>>cmn_Hant<< Students are often the most fussy readers, so bloggers start working to improve their writing levels and avoid being criticized.
In addition, blogging "forces students to be more insightful about the world around them."
>>cmn_Hant<< Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond traditional school instruction.
>>cmn_Hant<< "Adequate use of blogs, "can make students better at analyzing and contemplating; by responding positively to web material, students can find their position in the context of other people's articles and be able to present their views on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002). "
Ottawa is Canada’s capital, attractive and bilingual, highlighting a series of galleries and museums.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and further north is the untapped natural beauty of the Muskoka and across the river.
Ontario has become what outsiders think of Canada.
>>cmn_Hant<< Further north, the vast area is sparsely populated, and in some places is an uninhabited wilderness.
>>cmn_Hant<< A surprising comparison of population data: African Americans living in the United States are more numerous than Canadian citizens.
>>cmn_Hant<< East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island.
>>cmn_Hant<< The smaller islands are mostly independent countries, or belonging to France, and they are known for their luxury beach resorts.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, a doctrine prevalent in the Comoros and Mayotte countries.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Town route from Europe to India.
>>cmn_Hant<< The north is bordered by the Sahel region; the south and west face the Atlantic Ocean.
>>cmn_Hant<< Female: It is recommended that regardless of actual marital status, all female tourists should say they are married.
Don’t wear rings that look too expensive.
>>cmn_Hant<< Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment; and it is not uncommon to be followed, scratched, etc.
>>cmn_Hant<< Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stick to your position (reject decisively regardless of culture differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Mariners (Merenids), who used to be called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, and named it Casa Branca until the earthquake of 1755, when they abandoned it.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, where Spanish traders established a trading base and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of Morocco's most boring shopping destinations.
>>cmn_Hant<< Near the old town of Medina, shops selling traditional Moroccan goods and various gadgets such as taji pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs are found everywhere, but these stores are aimed at tourists.
>>cmn_Hant<< Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the easternmost side of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's streets, especially its center.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although Goma is still considered safe, any travel outside Goma should be investigated in advance to understand whether the ongoing fighting in North Kivu has been moderated.
>>cmn_Hant<< The city is also home to climbing Nyiragongo and Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla tracking project.
You can take the boda-boda (motorbike rental) to visit Goma. The normal (local) price for a short drive is 500 Congolese francs.
>>cmn_Hant<< Also, because of its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" was used to compare distant exotic lands.
>>cmn_Hant<< Today, although Timbuktu's reputation makes it a tourist destination and there is an airport, it is a poor town.
In 1990, it was listed on the World Heritage List as endangered because of the threat of deserts.
This is an important stop for Henry Louis Gates on PBS's "Wonders of the World in Africa" special.
>>cmn_Hant<< The city contrasts with the rest of the country, as it is more of an Arab style than an African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the main attraction of the South African National Park System (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, it charges daily.
With this card, you can access some of South Africa’s parks or all of the national parks.
>>cmn_Hant<< Hong Kong Island is synonymous with the Hong Kong region and is the focus of many visitors' minds.
The many buildings that make up Hong Kong’s skyline are like a gleaming bar chart.
Hong Kong from the best possible angle.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclamation land on the north coast.
This is where the British colonists occupied it.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, 80 kilometres (50 miles) long, stretching from the coast to Bangladesh and inland India.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This part of the forest within India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
These forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps, but also the remains of huge jungles.
The area of Sundburns is 3850 km2, of which about a third is water/swamp area.
Since 1966 Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that currently the district lives with 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 3 million plum deer.
There are buses all day departing from the inter-city bus station (cross river) but most bus trips, especially to the east and to Jacar/Bumtang, are between 06:30 and 07:30.
We recommend buying tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are comfortable to ride in a sturdy Japanese Coaster minibus.
To get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punaka (Nu 200), sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Oyapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge across the Oyapoque River connecting Oyapoque, Brazil with St. George's, French Guiana.
The two bridge towers are 83 meters high, the length of the bridge is 378 meters and there are two 3.50 meters wide lanes.
The bridge under the vertical clearance 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011 but did not start until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoint is expected to be completed as well.
The Guaraní are the most important indigenous groups living in what is now the East Paraguay region, where they live a semi-nomadic safari life and are also self-sufficient in agricultural activities.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as Guaycuru and Payagua who make their living by hunting, gathering and fishing.
>>cmn_Hant<< Paraguay in the 16th century, once known as the "Great Indian Province", was the product of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a three-century colonial period.
Since the construction of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain many of the city's native features and characteristics.
>>cmn_Hant<< Argentina is known for having the world's top horse teams and players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the horse court in Las Cañitas.
>>cmn_Hant<< On other days of the year, smaller tournaments and tournaments can also be seen here.
For tournament news and how to buy polo tickets,
>>cmn_Hant<< The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound, which is equivalent to the British Pound.
Currency can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
>>cmn_Hant<< Pounds are generally common everywhere on the island, and Stanley territory tends to pay with credit cards and dollars.
>>cmn_Hant<< In the outer islands, credit cards may not be available, but British and American currency can be used; please contact the homeowner in advance to confirm an acceptable payment method.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency off the island, so it is necessary to exchange before leaving the island.
>>cmn_Hant<< Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when the northern hemisphere winters, it is summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures often exceed 30°C during the summer months.
>>cmn_Hant<< Winters may appear colder than they seem: temperatures are rarely below zero, but when wind and humidity are combined, it can feel colder than the temperature displayed by the thermometer.
>>cmn_Hant<< There is no specific "rainy season" and "dry season" here: rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although many animals in the park are used to humans, wildlife is, after all, wildlife and we should not feed or disturb them.
The park’s administrators said they had to maintain a distance of at least 100 yards per metre with bears and wolves, and 25 yards per metre with all other wildlife.
>>cmn_Hant<< No matter how docile it may seem, almost all large animals, such as bison, elk, moose, bear, are likely to attack humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured by failing to maintain proper distance.
>>cmn_Hant<< In addition, note that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odor-producing foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 4 million.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay had a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the bay.
All but one of the British cruise ships sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In a struggle organized by the Maoist Movement for independence, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the death of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the Great Chief.
Auckland spans two ports so the area has many beaches. The most popular beaches are spread over three areas.
North Shore Beach (in the Northport area) is on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Swimming is safe, and most places have New Zealand Christmas tree shade.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes full of vacation homes and the coast is lined with various shops.
The main local beer is "No. 1" beer. Its taste is not complicated, but it is very good to drink and it is refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
>>cmn_Hant<< Many French wines can be purchased here, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more affordable for long-distance transport.
>>cmn_Hant<< Local tap water can be completely safe to drink, but if you're still worried, bottled water can be easily bought.
A small cup of black coffee is "Espresso", cappuccino cream (not foam) stacked very high, and tea is not matched with milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Juice is expensive but of good quality.
>>cmn_Hant<< There are many people touring the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and there are few injuries that occur as a result of participating in any of the above activities on the Great Barrier Reef.
Follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish will appear every October through April of the following year in 1770 near the town’s beaches and estuary. Occasionally they can be found at other points in time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The primary habitat for saltwater crocodiles is not the ocean, but the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Book in advance to reassure travelers.
Although travel agencies may help you book camping and other forms of accommodation, they usually work with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers, or even flight and hotel packages.
