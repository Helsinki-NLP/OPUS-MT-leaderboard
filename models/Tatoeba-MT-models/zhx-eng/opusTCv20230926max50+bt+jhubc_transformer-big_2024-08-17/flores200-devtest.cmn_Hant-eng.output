>>cmn_Hant<< In a keynote speech at the Tokyo Game Show on Thursday, Nintendo President Tatsuya Iwata announced the company's new Nintendo Revolution game console.
>>cmn_Hant<< The controller is similar to a television remote, using two sensors placed next to the user's TV to measure its position in stereo space by triangulation.
>>cmn_Hant<< This will allow the player to control the movement and movement in a video game by waving the device in the air.
>>cmn_Hant<< Shankaro Fisichella was unable to control the car, bringing the race to an end shortly after the start.
>>cmn_Hant<< His teammate Fernando Alonso took the lead for most of the race, but once he left the maintenance station, his race also ended, presumably because the right front wheel was not fitted.
>>cmn_Hant<< Shortly after Alonso's departure, Michael Schumacher also ended the race due to several races against his opponent during the match, causing a suspension system damage.
>>cmn_Hant<< According to the transcript of the press conference, he said, "She's cute and can sing."
"Every time we went through the rehearsal, I was really impressed."
After about 3 minutes of launch, the cabin camera showed a lot of insulated foam debris coming off the tank.
>>cmn_Hant<< But it is generally believed that it did no damage to the shuttle.
>>cmn_Hant<< N. Wayne Hale, Jr., head of NASA's shuttle program, said the foam fell "after the time we were worried about."
The performance started in five minutes with a sudden windstorm, and about a minute later the wind speed was up to 70 km/h... Then the rain came, the rain was fast and heavy, hit the skin like a needle, the hail fell from the sky, people were screaming, running and stepping on each other.
I lost my sister and her friends, and while I was on the run, there were two handicapped people in wheelchairs, and people jumped right over them and pushed them." - Armand Versace

The official death toll in some reports is eight, while official reports confirm that up to 30 people were injured; the actual number is still unknown.
>>cmn_Hant<< Pets who died after eating contaminated pet food have found melamine and melamine in their urine samples.
>>cmn_Hant<< According to researchers at the University of Guelph, the two compounds will react with each other to produce a crystallization of obstructive kidney function.
>>cmn_Hant<< Researchers add melamine and melamine to cat urine and observe the crystals formed in them.
>>cmn_Hant<< When compared through infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it is shown that the composition of these crystals corresponds to the crystals found in the urine of the victim's pet.
>>cmn_Hant<< I don't know if you're denying the knowledge, but much of Central America's merchandise comes into this country with tax-free treatment.
But 80% of our merchandise is taxed by Central American countries, and we treat you.
>>cmn_Hant<< It doesn't seem reasonable to me; it's certainly not fair.
>>cmn_Hant<< I tell people just how we treat you, and you treat us.
>>cmn_Hant<< California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill banning the sale of violent electric games to minors.
The bill requires violent video games sold in California to be labeled with the number "18" and stipulates that sales to minors are punishable by a $1,000 fine at a time.

>>cmn_Hant<< Uka misses his gun when aiming at the head of a fifth person.Schneider's injury causes long-lasting pain, blindness in one eye, loss of cranial bone, and reconstruction of the face in titanium.
>>cmn_Hant<< Schneider testified on video at a U.S. Air Force base in his hometown.
>>cmn_Hant<< In addition to Wednesday's match, Carpanedo also competed in two individual events in the tournament.
>>cmn_Hant<< Her first match was a minor round-robin and the first round ended in an unfinished round, with 36 of the 116 contestants in the competition achieving the same result.
Her other race was the Grand Tour, where she placed 10th in the women's group with a combined time of 4 minutes 41 seconds 30, 2 minutes 11 seconds 60 slower than Austrian Claudia Loesch in first place, and 1 second slower than Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani in ninth place.

>>cmn_Hant<< Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptops and mobile phones.
>>cmn_Hant<< Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five suspects who raped that Swiss woman and retrieved her cell phone and laptop computers."
>>cmn_Hant<< The names of the defendants are Baba Congal, Busa Congal, Lamplo Congal, Garza Congal and Visnu Congal.
>>cmn_Hant<< Constable Chandra Shehar Solanki said the defendants were masked to appear in court.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although three people were inside the house when the vehicle hit the house, no one was injured.
>>cmn_Hant<< However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
>>cmn_Hant<< The section of the road in which the accident was temporarily sealed when emergency rescue personnel rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
>>cmn_Hant<< Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.
>>cmn_Hant<< Adekoya (Adekoya) was subsequently charged with the murder of her son in Edinburgh County Court.
>>cmn_Hant<< She is in custody awaiting prosecution and trial, but due to her images having been widely distributed, any witness' testimony could be contaminated.
>>cmn_Hant<< This was a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the way Scottish justice works was different, and the court held that posting photographs would create potential bias.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University said, "If you post pictures of suspects, journalists are really in danger."
>>cmn_Hant<< The Royal Scottish Procuratorate, which is responsible for the overall prosecution, told reporters that no further comments will be made, at least before the prosecution.
According to leaked documents, the document will refer to a border dispute that Palestine wanted to build on before the 1967 Middle East war.
>>cmn_Hant<< Other topics in the purported document included the future course of Jerusalem, the common holy city of the two countries, and the Jordan Valley problem.
>>cmn_Hant<< Israel demanded that if the treaty were signed, it would continue to be stationed in the Jordan Valley for ten years, while the Palestinian Self-Government agreed to keep the garrison for only five years.
>>cmn_Hant<< Hunters participating in a hazardous animal control reinforcing test will be closely monitored by the National Park Manager as the relevant units will need to monitor and evaluate the performance of the test.
The NSW National Park Service (NPWS) has partnered with the Australian Shooting Sports Association (NSW) to recruit eligible volunteers under the Shooting Sports Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service's Park Conservation and Heritage Unit, four shooters selected for the first shooting have been given thorough safety and training guidance.
>>cmn_Hant<< Madrigal was sworn in yesterday in the Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP), made up of nine commissioners.
>>cmn_Hant<< It was the fifth provisional selection committee for Madhry in four years.
>>cmn_Hant<< As part of a package of measures to push the country towards a new election, the Presidential Commission last month recommended that the previous Provisional Electoral Commission resign.
>>cmn_Hant<< The committee was set up by Madhry's response to the mass anti-regime protests that began in October.
These sometimes use violent protests, due to the inability to hold elections, and some elections were held as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of iPod overheating were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 incidents related to the device.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Industry announced that Apple had informed them of another 34 overheating incidents, which the company declared were “not serious.”
>>cmn_Hant<< The government department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "regrettable".
>>cmn_Hant<< The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 09:19 p.m. GMT).

>>cmn_Hant<< The two photographers later traded with an elderly woman in need of a toilet; eventually Mandosa was shot dead.
>>cmn_Hant<< Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He was trained as an obstetrician and commenced practice at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
During his tenure at the hospital, Sir Liggins used his time after work to study the phenomenon of premature birth.
>>cmn_Hant<< His research suggests that if a certain hormone is administered, it will accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
>>cmn_Hant<< Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
>>cmn_Hant<< The wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tommy Dromen once said, "Luna was the first extreme queen...my first manager...Luna died on the night of the bimonthly, very special, like herself...a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels, a well-known wrestler, commented: "Luna is as weird as I am...maybe even weirder than I am...I love her and will miss her...I hope she goes to a better place."
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, there were 8% more people against Australia becoming a republic than there were in 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Girard declared during her campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believes Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II leaves office.
34% of people in the polls agree with this view, hoping Queen Elizabeth II will be the last monarch of Australia.
>>cmn_Hant<< Of the two extreme results of the poll, 29% of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle events at the British Games, and three swimming relays, but his symptoms cast doubt on his physical condition.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was unable to take drugs to suppress pain because the Olympics banned the use of those drugs.
Professor Curtis Cooper, a mathematician at the University of Central Missouri and a professor of computer science, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
>>cmn_Hant<< By early February, several people had verified the discovery with different hardware and software, and it was officially announced on Tuesday.
>>cmn_Hant<< Water on Earth may be brought by comets, and organic matter in water can form proteins and supply life.
>>cmn_Hant<< Scientists want to understand the process of planet formation, especially Earth, because comets have collided with Earth a long time ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< Gumo, 53, who was governor earlier this year, signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
>>cmn_Hant<< He called the rumours "the scribbles and ignorance of politics."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
>>cmn_Hant<< NextGen is a system that the FAA claims to allow aircraft to shorten flight paths, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and cut carbon emissions drastically.
>>cmn_Hant<< It uses satellite-based technology, while older technology based on ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
>>cmn_Hant<< No other mode of transport is provided, and the overground rail will not stop at Wembley, and there is no parking and parking transfer plan available at the scene.
>>cmn_Hant<< Due to concerns about traffic inconveniences, the game may be forced to open up when teams' supporters are unable to get to the scene for refueling.
>>cmn_Hant<< A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported that Ecuador's Galapagos islands were forming new species of birds.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although in the past it has been thought that the evolution of new species took longer, researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Switzerland have found that this new species evolved in just two generations, a mixture of the local endemic Darwin sparrow (Geospiza fortes) and the exotic cactus sparrow (Geospiza fortes).
Gold can be shaped into shapes. It can be shaped into tiny shapes.
The gold can be extended into thin filaments, then wrapped and woven.
>>cmn_Hant<< It can be made very thin and glued to other metals.Since it can be made very thin, it is sometimes also used in a book called the Mud Decoration Codex to decorate the hand-painted pictures in it.
It's called chemical pH. You can use kale juice as an indicator.
>>cmn_Hant<< The kale juice will change color according to the acidity of the chemical.
The acid-base value (pH) is based on the content of hydrogen ions in the chemical substance (pH = hydrogen).
>>cmn_Hant<< Hydrogen ions are protons after electron loss (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix these two dry powders together, then squeeze them into a ball with the clean hands that are soaked in water.
>>cmn_Hant<< The moisture in your hand reacts with the outer layer, thus producing an odd sense of touch and forming a shell.
>>cmn_Hant<< Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro has a flush toilet and is connected to a sophisticated sewage treatment system.
>>cmn_Hant<< In the towns of Minos in Crete and Santorini, Greece, people found the remains of a sewer system under the house.
>>cmn_Hant<< In ancient Egypt, there were toilets in Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths for men and women.
>>cmn_Hant<< When calling a friend who is far away in the sky, it is achieved through an artificial satellite.
>>cmn_Hant<< Artificial satellites in space receive signals and reflect them back to Earth in an instant.
>>cmn_Hant<< Artificial satellites are sent into space with rockets.Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere sometimes distorts our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet to put a satellite or telescope into space.
>>cmn_Hant<< Wheels changed the world in amazing ways...The greatest contribution of wheels to humanity is to provide us with a simpler, faster means of transportation.
>>cmn_Hant<< It has brought us trains, cars and other transport devices.
>>cmn_Hant<< Below them lies a larger variety of medium-sized cats, feeding mainly on medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelopes and deer.
>>cmn_Hant<< Eventually many small cats (occasionally domestic cats) will also prey on numerous small prey, including insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
>>cmn_Hant<< The secret of success lies in the idea of niches, that is, each cat's job to be unique, so that they don't compete with each other.
>>cmn_Hant<< Lions are the most herded cats and live in a large group known as the Lions.
>>cmn_Hant<< The lion population consists of one to three adult male lions, plus up to thirty female and young lions.
>>cmn_Hant<< The female lions are usually close to each other and are sisters and daughters in the same large family.
>>cmn_Hant<< Lions behave very much like wolves or dogs, and these two animals are accidentally similar to lions (but not to other large cats) and are also very aggressive towards their prey.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tigers are all-around athletes who are able to climb (albeit less specialized), swim, jump over distance and have more than five times the pull of a strong human.
Tigers and lions, leopards and leopards belong in the same category. Only these four cats have the ability to roar.
>>cmn_Hant<< The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion's voice altogether, but more like a word of confusion, shouting.
Puma likes small animals, they hunt monkeys, snakes and rodents, and they hunt birds if they can.
>>cmn_Hant<< Scientists believe that puma cats track and look for prey by smell and find sites where the prey is lost by smell.
They have good night vision and can move quietly at night.
>>cmn_Hant<< When a small group of organisms (a small community) is separated from the major groups they come from (e.g., crossing mountains or rivers, or moving to new islands, so that they cannot easily return), they usually find themselves in a different environment than before.
>>cmn_Hant<< This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different traits or changes to be able to compete more strongly than in the past.
>>cmn_Hant<< The original population has not changed at all, so it still needs the same adaptability as before.
>>cmn_Hant<< As time passed, the newborn population began to adapt to new environments, and their appearance became more and more different from others.
>>cmn_Hant<< Eventually, after thousands of years, or even millions of years, these two groups will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
>>cmn_Hant<< This process is called germination, which means that new species are produced.The germination is an inevitable consequence of the evolutionary process and is an important part.
>>cmn_Hant<< Plants make oxygen inhaled by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans.
>>cmn_Hant<< Plants gain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. plants can also provide shade at the same time.
>>cmn_Hant<< We build houses with plants, make clothes, and most of the food we eat is also plants; without them, animals would not be able to survive.
>>cmn_Hant<< The clastids were the top predators of that period, so they were not afraid of any creature except the other clastids.
Its long jaw is filled with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set of teeth on its upper jaw, which means no living creature can escape before it.
It eats turtles, large fish, other cacti, dinosaurs, and maybe even its own kind.
>>cmn_Hant<< It will also attack anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like the Tyrannosaurus is not its opponent.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although Roman food is mostly unfamiliar to us, they do eat strange or rare foods such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a species of hyena known as sleeping rats.
>>cmn_Hant<< Another difference is that when poor people and women sit in chairs and eat their food, rich men like to go to parties together and enjoy their large meals side-by-side in the seats.
>>cmn_Hant<< Dining in ancient Rome did not contain food imported into Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and the ancient Romans had never eaten turkey.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Babylonians built a major temple for each god, and those temples were considered the house of God.
>>cmn_Hant<< People will prepare offerings to God, and the priests will work to meet the needs of God through rituals and festivals.
>>cmn_Hant<< Each temple has an open temple atrium followed by an inner temple accessible only by priests.
>>cmn_Hant<< Some of the temples also housed pyramid-type special towers known as towers.
>>cmn_Hant<< The top of the tower is a special temple of God.
>>cmn_Hant<< In the warmer climate of the Middle East, houses are less important.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women would cook in the yard; the store was just a counter against the street.
>>cmn_Hant<< There are no large forests on Canaan's land, so timber is particularly expensive.
>>cmn_Hant<< Greenland is sparsely populated.In the Northern European epic, red-haired Eric is expelled from Iceland for murder, and as he heads further west, discovers Greenland and takes the name for it.
>>cmn_Hant<< But whatever his findings, the Eskimo tribe were already living there at that time.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, the king, customs and history.
>>cmn_Hant<< If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there's a treasure map painted on the back of the American Declaration of Independence.
>>cmn_Hant<< However, that is not true. Although there is some handwritten content on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The text on the back of the U.S. Declaration of Independence is the original July 4, 1776 Declaration of Independence.
Although no one knows who wrote this text, it is certain that this huge parchment file (length is about 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was earlier rolled up for the collection.
>>cmn_Hant<< Therefore, it is very likely that the phrase will be added just to mark it.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles restored freedom to the north of France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the French Vichy, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the aggressors rather than against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, known as Operation Dragon Cavalry.
>>cmn_Hant<< In just two weeks, the U.S. and Free French forces liberated Southern France and turned to Germany.
>>cmn_Hant<< Civilization is a unique culture shared by a group of people who are significant in number and live and work in a collaborative way (i.e., society).
>>cmn_Hant<< The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", which means "civic". It is related to the Latin words "civis" and "civitas", meaning the distinction between "civic" and "city or city-state", which in some ways also defines the scale of society.
>>cmn_Hant<< City-states are the precursors of the state, and civilizational culture means to pass on knowledge for generations, and to perpetuate cultural footprints and universal diffusion.
>>cmn_Hant<< Smaller cultures tend to disappear without historical traces and cannot be identified as orthodox civilizations.
>>cmn_Hant<< During the War of Independence, these thirteen states first established a vulnerable central government under the Articles of Confederation (which Congress was its sole agency).
>>cmn_Hant<< Congress has no power to tax, and because there is no state executive or judicial branch, it must rely on the agencies of state authority that tend to be disjointed to enforce the law.
>>cmn_Hant<< It also has no power to repeal the state-to-state tax laws and customs duties.
>>cmn_Hant<< These regulations require unanimous consent from all states in order to make changes, and the states' attitudes toward central government are very hasty, and their representatives are often absent.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Italy national football team and the Germany national football team are both the second most successful teams in the world, and they were also the champions of the 2006 International Football Federation World Cup.
>>cmn_Hant<< Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, straight-wheel hockey and F1 racing.
>>cmn_Hant<< Winter sports programs are most popular in the Northern Territory, where Italians will also participate in relevant international and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Since Japan has a group of islands, from a geographical point of view, Japan is often classified as an "island"
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed through and recorded the island's name as Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
>>cmn_Hant<< In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, opening the transformation of native grain production methods and hiring Chinese laborers to work in the company's rice and sugarcane fields.
In 1683, the Qing government (1644-1912) took control of western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan by force and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Maguan, ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan.
>>cmn_Hant<< Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, divided into embolic sunstones, solar temples and three window temples.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most of the buildings on the edge of the relics have been reconstructed so that visitors can better understand the original look.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been repaired and work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common static image format is 35 cm, which is also the main negative size at the end of the analog film era.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is still in production today, but more importantly, the digital camera's sensor component specification follows its length aspect ratio.
In fact, the 35mm format is somewhat confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
>>cmn_Hant<< The aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
>>cmn_Hant<< Many common formats (such as the APS Advanced Photography System format) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
>>cmn_Hant<< The trio, which are often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline and keeps the picture in order while creating vitality.
>>cmn_Hant<< It points out that after the three-grade points of vertical and horizontal graphics, the intersection of the lines is the most effective position for the taking of the main body (see example).
>>cmn_Hant<< During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was heavily scrutinized.
>>cmn_Hant<< For more than a thousand years, despite the differences in language and customs, Christianity has kept European nations closely connected.
>>cmn_Hant<< Its omnipresent ability affects all, up to the king and down to the civilians.
>>cmn_Hant<< Christianity has a major creed that wealth must be used to help those who suffer and are poor, and that the funds of the church are specifically set up for such reasons.
>>cmn_Hant<< For more than a thousand years, the core of the Church's power was in Rome, a concentration of power and money that led many to question whether the Church did indeed follow this creed.
>>cmn_Hant<< Shortly after the outbreak of war, Britain began to launch a sea blockade on Germany.
>>cmn_Hant<< This strategy of cutting off the necessary supply of military and civilian biological resources did work, although this type of containment has violated international laws established and generally accepted by the respective countries through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
>>cmn_Hant<< The United Kingdom placed mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire sea and even endangering neutral ships.
>>cmn_Hant<< Since the countries did not react much to the tactic, Germany therefore thought that their unrestricted submarine warfare would not incur a strong backlash.
In the 1920s, the general attitudes of most citizens and countries were pacifism and isolationism.
>>cmn_Hant<< After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, each nation wished to avoid this situation happening again in the future.
>>cmn_Hant<< In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job at Edison's in New York City.
>>cmn_Hant<< He came to the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry and Charles Bacheler (the manager of his previous job) for a letter of recommendation he had written to Thomas Edison.
>>cmn_Hant<< Ancient China used a unique way to denote different periods; China's various stages or families in power belonged to distinct dynasties.
It was also a period of turmoil in all parts of the country, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms era between the Han and the Jin Dynasties in the 60 years.
>>cmn_Hant<< During these periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles to fight for the throne.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, and thousands of people lost their lives to compete for the throne in the Grand Palace of Xi'an.
>>cmn_Hant<< The revolution produced many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metrics of the public system, the conversion of authoritarianism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the state belonged to the people rather than to the sovereign alone.
>>cmn_Hant<< And after the Revolution, various positions were opened to all men who actively sought employment, allowing the most intentional wishes and achievers to take over.
>>cmn_Hant<< The same thing happens in the military, because they no longer use the hierarchy to divide the ranks, but instead base it on talent.
>>cmn_Hant<< The French Revolution also inspired many other countries to revolutionize the forced working class.
>>cmn_Hant<< Muhammad was deeply interested in transcending the things of this secular world.He used to go to a cave meditation called Hira on Mount Noor (light).
>>cmn_Hant<< The cave itself has changed over time, presenting the spiritual orientation of birth-moving Muhammad.
>>cmn_Hant<< This cave is located on a hilltop north of Mecca and is completely cut off from the outside world.
>>cmn_Hant<< In fact, even when one is aware of its existence it is not easy to find, and once inside a cave, it is completely isolated from the world.
>>cmn_Hant<< Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains; the inside of the cave can only see or hear a small part of the world.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only seven wonders of the world that still stand today.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, and it is one of the many large pyramid buildings built to commemorate the late Pharaoh.
>>cmn_Hant<< Located in the Giza Plateau or "Giza Pyramids Group" in the Valley of the Dead of Egypt, it contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest in the world), several small mausoleums, several temples and giant sphinxes.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Gough Pharaoh, while many smaller pyramids, mausoleums and temples were built to honor Gough's consort and family members.
>>cmn_Hant<< The "up bow" marker looks like a V, and the "down bow" marker looks like a book pin, as well as a square at the bottom opening.
>>cmn_Hant<< The above indicates that you should start pushing the bow from the tip of the bow, and the next indicates that you should start pulling the bow from the bow root (where your hand holds the bow).
>>cmn_Hant<< The upper bow mark usually represents a softer sound, while the lower bow mark represents a stronger and more firmer sound.

The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antony and their two children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and the king's sister, Princess Elizabeth, were forced by a group of market women to relocate from the Palace of Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
>>cmn_Hant<< They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob along the way, and the people shouted and threatened against the king and queen.
>>cmn_Hant<< The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage.
>>cmn_Hant<< At some point, a mob member even waved the head of the royal guard in front of the terrified queen, who was killed at Versailles.
>>cmn_Hant<< American imperialism's campaign for war spending in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
>>cmn_Hant<< They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, paying most of their government spending, while interest on bonds floated through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
>>cmn_Hant<< Of course, the U.S. has long exploited the ultra-high profits that the Filipinos have acquired and become a basic gain for American imperialism.
>>cmn_Hant<< To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the veins that drive the creation of this organization.
>>cmn_Hant<< The times when these events took place are commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, i.e. the 11, 12 and 13th centuries in European history (1000–1300 AD).
>>cmn_Hant<< The Middle Ages preceded the Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, while traditionally it is thought that the Middle Ages ended around 1500.
>>cmn_Hant<< The term technological determinism condenses many concepts that have been practiced, from technological pushes or technological mastery changes, all the way to a more rigorous "the relevant logic behind the laws of science and the forms of science's performance in technology will drive human destiny".
>>cmn_Hant<< Most interpretations of technological determinism have two main ideas: that technology itself has a far more developmental path than cultural or political factors, and that technology in turn will "influence" the inherent patterns of society, rather than being socially constrained.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, it is said that cars will inevitably drive road development.
>>cmn_Hant<< However, for the sake of a small number of cars creating a nationwide road network is not economical, and people have thus developed new manufacturing methods to reduce the cost of ownership of the car.
>>cmn_Hant<< The number of people who own the car will also increase the chance of road accidents, and in turn enable humans to develop new medical techniques to repair injured limbs.
>>cmn_Hant<< Cultural determinism is one of the important constructs of Romanticism, drawing much of it from writers such as Goethe, Fechter and Schlegel.
>>cmn_Hant<< In the context of Romanticism, the geographic environment shapes the individual and over time produces customs and cultures related to that geographic environment.These customs and cultures are better than the laws imposed arbitrarily because they are in harmony with local society.
>>cmn_Hant<< Just as Paris was recognized as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was also recognized as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury center began around 400 years ago and continued all the way to around 1100 years ago.
Its status gradually declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders had returned with accompaniments such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what was sold in the Byzantine market.
>>cmn_Hant<< It was at this time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
>>cmn_Hant<< At first, the dress was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slowness of the communication pipeline, the Western style may fall behind 25 to 30 years.
>>cmn_Hant<< Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a unique style.A major development at the time was that members of the Crusaders began to fix their clothes with tamarinds.
>>cmn_Hant<< Self-sufficient agriculture is the type of agriculture in which crops are produced only enough to keep farmers and their families warm.
>>cmn_Hant<< Self-sufficiency farming is a simple agricultural system that usually adopts organic farming, retains and uses seeds of native crops from local ecoregions, adopts wheelwork or other relatively simple techniques to increase production.
>>cmn_Hant<< Historically, most farmers have been engaged in self-sufficient agriculture, and many developing countries have remained so.
>>cmn_Hant<< Subcultures make preferences similar, and equally feel that people who are neglected by the mainstream of society come together to develop a sense of identity.
>>cmn_Hant<< The subculture will be distinctive due to the age level, race, class, geographical location or gender of the members.
>>cmn_Hant<< The traits that enable subcultures to be established may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography or a variety of factors.
>>cmn_Hant<< Members of the subculture usually highlight their belongings to the group through special, symbolic forms, including dress, behavior and the use of the codex.
>>cmn_Hant<< One method commonly used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite the unfortunate cases in which several children suffer neglect, bad luck or deliberate abuse during their growth and thus do not receive the socialization process assigned to them by adults.
>>cmn_Hant<< Such children are known as "wild children". Some wild children have been incarcerated (the same time as parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because parents are not accepting their children's mental or physical disabilities.
>>cmn_Hant<< A homeless child may experience severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing home.
>>cmn_Hant<< Other children are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
>>cmn_Hant<< If the wild child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it will behave almost exactly the same behavior as the animal that takes care of him (with physical conditions permitting), such as showing fear or indifference to humans.
>>cmn_Hant<< A project-based approach to learning makes learning easier and more interesting, and eagle-framed learning goes one more level.
>>cmn_Hant<< Eagle-mounted teaching is not a learning method, but an aid that provides support to people who are experiencing new learning experiences (such as using new computer programs or starting new projects, etc.).
Eagle Rack is both virtual and physical, in other words, the teacher and Microsoft Office tapestries helper are a kind of eagle rack.
>>cmn_Hant<< The virtual eagle frame is built into the software and functions as a procedure for asking questions, prompting and illustrating what students may find difficult to handle on their own.
>>cmn_Hant<< There are many reasons why children are sent to foster care, including neglect of care, abuse, and even blackmail.
>>cmn_Hant<< No child should grow up in a situation where there is no upbringing, care and education, but this is not the case.
>>cmn_Hant<< We think the foster system is a haven for these children.
>>cmn_Hant<< Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
>>cmn_Hant<< Foster families should provide all the necessities they lacked in their previous families.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Internet combines the two elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
>>cmn_Hant<< From the use and satisfaction path, the distinctive features of the Internet open up new horizons.
For example, both "learning" and "socialization" are important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
>>cmn_Hant<< When investigating the response of the audience to the site in Eighmey and McCord (1998) papers, it was found that "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also new levels of motivation.
>>cmn_Hant<< The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries for interpreting microexpressions and maintaining facial movements for only a few milliseconds.
>>cmn_Hant<< In particular, it is thought that it is possible to detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
>>cmn_Hant<< In his article, "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks notes that people who cannot understand the contents of the speech because of brain damage can still accurately feel the sincerity of the speaker.
>>cmn_Hant<< He even argued that animals such as house dogs may have this ability to explain human behavior.
>>cmn_Hant<< Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: recessive and demonstrative.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mutations increase new genetic variability, while natural selection removes them from the phenotypic variability bank.
>>cmn_Hant<< For each generation, separation and recombination will cause the two sets of genes, both demonstrative and recessive, to continuously produce changes.
>>cmn_Hant<< The digestive system resembles human primates, and it is difficult to get enough amino acids from plants on the prairie.
>>cmn_Hant<< In addition, insufficient intake of amino acids can lead to serious consequences: malnutrition and malnutrition eventually lead to death.
>>cmn_Hant<< The most accessible plant resources should be proteins available in leaves and chickpeas, but unless cooked, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ant, termite, egg) are not only easy to digest, but also provide quality proteins that contain all the necessary amino acids.
>>cmn_Hant<< After considering all the factors, we don't need to be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a way similar to chimpanzees on the present reckless.
>>cmn_Hant<< Sleep interruptions are a process that deliberately wakes up during a general sleep and goes to sleep in a short period of time (10-60 minutes later).
>>cmn_Hant<< By using a relatively quiet alarm clock, making you conscious but not fully awake, you can easily do this.
>>cmn_Hant<< If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, you can place the alarm on the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed and turn it off.
>>cmn_Hant<< Other options based on physiological cycles include drinking large amounts of liquid (especially water or tea, a recognized diuretic) before bedtime, which causes people to have to get up and urinate.
>>cmn_Hant<< The level of calm within a person is inversely proportional to the level of physical and mental tension in a person.
The more relaxed you are, the more vital you are. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
>>cmn_Hant<< All can reach the realm of enlightenment...The only obstacle to the path of enlightenment is our own anxiety and negative energy.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but due to the path of love in Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga, Tibetan Buddhism was able to flourish.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, including kundalini yoga, meditation and embracing the practice of love for all living beings.
>>cmn_Hant<< While doing kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) will awaken through yoga movement, breathing exercise, mantero prayer and visualization.
>>cmn_Hant<< The core of meditation in Tibetan Buddhism is Ben-Joy Yoga.By looking at the divine Buddha, purifying all energy channels, activating the pulse wheel, creating an enlightenment consciousness.
>>cmn_Hant<< Germany was a common enemy of the Second World War, prompting the Soviet Union to cooperate with the United States...Conflicts on institutions, practices and culture as the war ended gave rise to a distaste for these countries.
>>cmn_Hant<< Only two years after the end of World War II, the original allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
>>cmn_Hant<< It continued for forty years in succession and was fought by acting troops on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
>>cmn_Hant<< By the time of September 17, 1939, the Polish line had been lost, with the only hope of retreating and recuperating next to the bridgehead in Romania.
More than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops violated the Riga Peace Accords, the Posu Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements to invade eastern Poland and then enter Belarus and Ukraine, forming the front between Belarus and Ukraine.
>>cmn_Hant<< The use of ships to deliver cargo is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and cargo across the sea.
>>cmn_Hant<< Traditionally, the Navy's mission was to ensure that the country could safely transfer people and goods, while interfering with the operations of enemy countries to transfer people and goods.
>>cmn_Hant<< One of the most recent examples of this concern is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies to the other side of the Atlantic to help Britain.
>>cmn_Hant<< At the same time, the German Navy attempted to disrupt transport (mainly using U-boats).
>>cmn_Hant<< If the Allies were defeated, Germany might conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
>>cmn_Hant<< The goat appears to have been tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in Iran's Zagros Mountains.
>>cmn_Hant<< Ancient cultures and tribes began to feed them in order to obtain milk, hair, meat and skin.
>>cmn_Hant<< Breeding goats generally raise hills or other grazing areas, which are usually taken care of by the herders of children or adolescents and are similar to the more well-known herders.These grazing methods are still used by people today.
>>cmn_Hant<< England built the Mara Track as early as the sixteenth century.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although the four-wheeled cargo track consisted of only parallel plank strips, it allowed horses to haul cargo on the track, which was faster and able to load more cargo than the slightly sturdy pavement at the time.
Early on, track pillows were used to secure the tracks, but gradually, people found the tracks more efficient if they were ironed.
>>cmn_Hant<< This became common practice, but iron causes more wear on the wagon's wooden wheels.
>>cmn_Hant<< Eventually, the iron wheel replaced the wooden wheel.In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
>>cmn_Hant<< The first known transport was walking, and with the emergence of Homo Erectus (i.e., the upright man), humans began to walk upright two million years ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< Their evolutionary ancestors, the Southern australopithecines, were not accustomed to walking upright.
>>cmn_Hant<< Features of bipedal locomotion have been found in the fossils of australopithecines from 420 to 3.9 million years ago, although Chad apes may have walked with bipedal locomotion as early as 7 million years ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< We can start living a more environmentally friendly life, we can devote ourselves to the environmental movement and even become activists to minimise future pain.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is like "headache doctors, footache doctors" in many situations, but if we want more than a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and solve them thoroughly.
>>cmn_Hant<< The world has changed because of advances in human science and technology, and because of overpopulation and human wasteful lifestyles, the problem has become aggravated, a point which is more obvious.
>>cmn_Hant<< After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the John Dunlap Printing House.
150 to 200 copies were printed throughout the night, now known as the "Leippe One-Sided Print".
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and George Washington read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 copies known to still exist when the single-sided printed version of Lep is the oldest surviving version of this document, and the original manuscripts have not been preserved.
>>cmn_Hant<< Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, which is what we call birds.
>>cmn_Hant<< Because they have feathers and are able to fly, many people don't consider them a species of dinosaur.
>>cmn_Hant<< But birds have many similarities with dinosaurs.
>>cmn_Hant<< They have scales and claws on their feet, will lay eggs and will walk with two hind feet like Tyrannosaurus.
>>cmn_Hant<< In fact, now all computers are based on messages that operate on binary encoding.
>>cmn_Hant<< Binary numbers can only have one or two values of 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits as computer terms call them.
Poisoning may not appear immediately. Vomiting symptoms are too common to be directly diagnosed.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is best to judge signs of intoxication in the body, and it may be found that there are containers of drugs or toxic household chemicals that have been opened.
>>cmn_Hant<< Review the first aid instructions on the specific poison label.
>>cmn_Hant<< The term "bug" is the official term for this type of insect by entomologists.
The name comes from ancient knowledge of bedbugs -- highly parasitic insects.
>>cmn_Hant<< Both the prey and the bedbug have characteristics that grow within the nest and are able to adapt to life in the nest or in the dwellings of their hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it a major neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
>>cmn_Hant<< Multiple sclerosis is a condition that affects the central nervous system such as the brain, spinal cord and the optic nerve.
>>cmn_Hant<< The study found that women were twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis than men.
>>cmn_Hant<< Couples may recognize that raising a baby is not in their or their child's best interests.
>>cmn_Hant<< These chaperones can choose to plan to adopt their children.
>>cmn_Hant<< Adoption is the termination of parental rights by the parent to allow another couple to raise their children.
>>cmn_Hant<< The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through a scientific method ... this method in fact leads to much scientific research as well.
>>cmn_Hant<< But experimental methods are not the only ones, and experiments are tests that eliminate one or more hypotheses, and asking questions and carrying out observations can also lead to scientific research.
>>cmn_Hant<< Naturalists and philosophers focus on classic texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
>>cmn_Hant<< All of Aristotle's views on scientific problems, including psychology, are accepted.
>>cmn_Hant<< With the fall of Greek learning, the Western world broke away its roots with Greek philosophy and science.
>>cmn_Hant<< The physiological and behavioral rhythms observed by many scholars are usually highly dependent on biological endogenous cycles and their substances produced with the physiological clock.
>>cmn_Hant<< Not only is it a weekly rhythm that responds to external weekly threads, it is observable in most organisms such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
>>cmn_Hant<< A physiological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continuously runs on its own cycle even when there is no external signal.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Hershey-Zais experiment was one of the main experiments that showed DNA as a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use a bacteriophage, or virus, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
>>cmn_Hant<< They conducted two experiments, one using radiophosphorus-labeled DNA in phages, and the other using radiosulfur-labeled proteins.
>>cmn_Hant<< Depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are reproductive lineal cells, the mutation can have a variety of different effects.
>>cmn_Hant<< Only mutations in reproductive cell line cells will be passed on to their children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
>>cmn_Hant<< A nature-themed trip will attract people of interest from nature to participate in order to enjoy natural scenery, including wildlife.
>>cmn_Hant<< Examples of live events include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and information about visiting parks and studying ecosystems.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, visit Borneo, photographing and understanding orangutans.
>>cmn_Hant<< Every morning, a group of people drive away from the small rural town to their job site and rub off with another group of people, whose departure was precisely the job destination of another group of people.
>>cmn_Hant<< In such a busy traffic journey, everyone has some degree of connection to this private car-based transportation system and supports its existence.
>>cmn_Hant<< Science now notes that such large-scale carbon-economic activity has freed the biosphere from its stable state of support for human evolution over the past two million years.
>>cmn_Hant<< All are involved in social activities, using transportation systems...almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
>>cmn_Hant<< In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar complaints about water quality and the collapse of bridges.
>>cmn_Hant<< Why does the transportation system bring in these complaints, and why does it cause problems every day, because of the lack of capacity of the transportation engineer, or for a more fundamental reason?
>>cmn_Hant<< Traffic flow is the study of individual driving and movement of vehicles between the two sites, and the interaction relationship between passers-by.
>>cmn_Hant<< The problem is that because driving habits cannot be predicted 100%, it is very difficult to study traffic flow.
>>cmn_Hant<< Fortunately, the driving behavior tends to be within a reasonable uniformity range, and as a result, there is also a reasonable uniformity of vehicle trends and can be expressed roughly mathematically.
>>cmn_Hant<< To better represent traffic flow, we define the relationship between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
>>cmn_Hant<< These relationships contribute to the planning, design and operation of transportation facilities.
>>cmn_Hant<< Insects are the first animals to fly in the air. their ability to fly allows them to evade natural enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings along the body.
>>cmn_Hant<< This gives them more small places to drill down to avoid predators.
>>cmn_Hant<< Nowadays, insects that can't hide their wings are only dragonflies and leeches.
>>cmn_Hant<< Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
>>cmn_Hant<< Some people think he's right, but many people think the opposite; they think the solar system (even other stars) that includes the Sun is moving around the Earth.
>>cmn_Hant<< That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel moving, does it?
>>cmn_Hant<< The Amazon is the second longest river on Earth and has the largest amount of water.It has eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching six miles wide.
About 20% of the water on Earth that flows into the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long, bringing together rivers from thousands of small rivers.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although the construction of the stone pyramid continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the construction scale and technical excellence of the Giza pyramid were unattainable.
>>cmn_Hant<< The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were greatly astonished at the historical remains left by their ancestors, which had been around for over a thousand years.
>>cmn_Hant<< With a population of around 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Vatican's laws and official texts are in Italian.
>>cmn_Hant<< Italian is also the language commonly used by most of the working population of the country, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
>>cmn_Hant<< All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
>>cmn_Hant<< People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they all exist in nature in their original form and use primitive tools to open them fairly simply.
>>cmn_Hant<< The philosopher Aristotelian thesis, all things are made up of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air and fire.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solids, liquids, gases and isotopes, though he also deduce that they become new matter to form what we see.
>>cmn_Hant<< Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
>>cmn_Hant<< There can also be alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements (e.g. carbon).
>>cmn_Hant<< All things in the universe are made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
>>cmn_Hant<< The atoms are so small that they are trillions of atoms small enough to stuff into the end of the sentence at the end of the period.
>>cmn_Hant<< As a result, pencils became many people's best friends when they first came to life.
>>cmn_Hant<< Unfortunately, as new writing styles arose, the status and use of pencils declined.
>>cmn_Hant<< Everyone is now writing messages on the computer screen and there's no longer any need to sharpen the pencil machine.
>>cmn_Hant<< We can only wonder where the keyboard will go when a new invention emerges.
>>cmn_Hant<< The principle of nuclear fission bomb operation is based on the need for a large amount of energy to fuse numerous protons and neutrons into one atomic nucleus.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy cart up a mountain.
>>cmn_Hant<< Some atoms have a unstable core, which means that they are also susceptible to splitting in the absence of or very small thrusts.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Moon's surface is made up of rock and dust.The outermost layer of the Moon is called the Earth's crust.
>>cmn_Hant<< The crust is about seventy kilometers thick at the proximal end and about one hundred kilometers thick at the far end.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is thinner under the lunar sea and thicker under the plateau.
There may be more moons at the proximal end due to the thinner crust.
>>cmn_Hant<< At the core of content theory, it is to find things that move people's hearts or attract them.
>>cmn_Hant<< These theories suggest that people have some needs or desires that are internalized in the process of growing adults.
>>cmn_Hant<< These theories explore what makes some people want something, and what makes them want to do or not do something in their environment.
>>cmn_Hant<< Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, supervisors may develop two behaviors when they begin to lead their peers.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is difficult for managers of this type to make unpopular decisions, perform disciplinary actions, perform performance evaluations, assign scope of responsibility and let subordinates do their duty.
>>cmn_Hant<< The other end of the spectrum, on the other hand, transforms into a very different person who thinks he or she must change all the practices of the team all the time and act in his own way.
>>cmn_Hant<< After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
>>cmn_Hant<< This behavior at times creates disagreements between leaders and other team members.
>>cmn_Hant<< Virtual teams must adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
>>cmn_Hant<< Virtual team members are usually the point of contact for the physical team that is directly engaged.
>>cmn_Hant<< They usually have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their team may be paired with different time zones for meetings, and their local management hierarchy may not be able to understand this.
>>cmn_Hant<< Having a veritable "invisible management team" (from Larson and LaFasto's 1989 book, p. 109) is also a unique element of constructing a virtual team.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Invisible Team is a management team where each member belongs directly to the team and from there the team sets the standard for each member.
>>cmn_Hant<< Why do organizations want to go through time-consuming processes to build learning institutions? One of the goals of putting the organization's learning concept into practice is innovation.
>>cmn_Hant<< Creativity and uniqueness can be achieved when each functional department within the organization is effectively using all available resources.
>>cmn_Hant<< As a result, the process of organizing a joint effort to overcome obstacles can drive the process of innovation to meet the needs of the customer.
>>cmn_Hant<< Before organizations have the ability to innovate, leaders should create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
>>cmn_Hant<< Angel (2006) illustrates a continuous pattern, which is a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
>>cmn_Hant<< Neurobiological data provide concrete evidence for the theoretical methods of cognitive research, so that the scope of research is narrowed and more precise.
>>cmn_Hant<< The association between brain pathology and behavior supports research by scientists.
>>cmn_Hant<< For a long time, people have always known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain psychological functions.
>>cmn_Hant<< The invention of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and operating processes never before seen.
>>cmn_Hant<< This provides us with much information and material for creating model models that help to understand the processes of our mind's functioning.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, artificial intelligence forms an extremely important branch of computer science, specializing in dealing with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptations.
>>cmn_Hant<< One of the contents of artificial intelligence research is the production of machines that automate the execution of tasks that need to be performed in intelligent behavior.
>>cmn_Hant<< Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and identifying handwritten words, sounds and human faces.
>>cmn_Hant<< These things develop into different disciplines, with a focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
>>cmn_Hant<< AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, and are also built into certain home computers and electric game software.
>>cmn_Hant<< Off-campus teaching is an important part of school education.Many times, teachers will want to take students to places where buses can't.
>>cmn_Hant<< Technology provides virtual off-campus teaching as a solution.Students can sit in the classroom and visit museum art, visit aquariums or admire beautiful art.
>>cmn_Hant<< Sharing off-campus teaching through virtual means is also a good way to look back at that trip and share experiences with future classes.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina, each year design a website for their North State Capital visit, which is revised every year, but the older version remains online as a scrapbook to make it.
>>cmn_Hant<< Blogs also help to improve students' writing ability.While students often start their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, it is generally possible to change this because of the presence of readers.
>>cmn_Hant<< Since students are usually the most fussy readers, blogger authors will begin to work to strengthen their writing to avoid criticism.
>>cmn_Hant<< Writing a blog also "forces students to learn more about the world around them." In order to satisfy the audience's interest, students become more intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
>>cmn_Hant<< Blogging is an inspired collaboration tool that can encourage students to extend their learning far beyond traditional school life.
>>cmn_Hant<< Proper use of blogs "can enhance students' ability to analyze and critique; students can clearly define what position they are in the context of articles written by others through positive feedback online textbooks, and they can draw their own perspectives on a particular topic (Olaves, 2002).
>>cmn_Hant<< Ottawa is the capital of Canada, with a beautiful and pleasant environment, in both English and French, with many galleries and museums displaying the past and present of Canada.
>>cmn_Hant<< Further south is Niagara Falls, while north is Muskoka and other areas, where the natural beauty remains undeveloped.
>>cmn_Hant<< All of these and other species above allow Ontario to be considered a typical Canadian look by outsiders.
>>cmn_Hant<< Larger areas further north are sparsely populated, some of them almost unsmoked wilderness.
>>cmn_Hant<< One population that surprised many compared: African Americans living in the United States, more than the citizens of Canada.
>>cmn_Hant<< The East African islands are located along the eastern coast of Africa on the Indian Ocean.
>>cmn_Hant<< Madagascar is the largest of these islands, rich in wildlife, making the island itself a continent.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or have a history with France and are known for their luxury beachfront resorts.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and Islam gained a great deal of development in the Comoros and Mayotte islands.

>>cmn_Hant<< Wearing a ring will also help (but don't wear it to look too expensive.)
>>cmn_Hant<< Female friends should also understand that cultural differences can lead to certain situations in which they see harassment, being followed, and situations such as being caught in the arm are not uncommon.
>>cmn_Hant<< Be firm when rejecting men, don't be afraid to stick to the stand (whether there is a cultural difference or not, it's all wrong!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. The Phoenicians, Romans and the Mariners used it as a strategic port called Anfa.

>>cmn_Hant<< Although Goma is still considered safe, to travel outside of Goma, it is necessary to do enough homework to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu.
>>cmn_Hant<< The city is also the base for climbing the Niragongo volcano, allowing for some of Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla tracking activities.
You can use the Boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) for a short trip to Goma, the average (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs.
>>cmn_Hant<< Because it was more difficult to enter by comparison, "Timbuktu" gradually became a symbol of a distant country.
>>cmn_Hant<< Today Timbuktu is a poor town, but the passing fame makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List because of the threat of desert dust.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is one of the main stops of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "The Wonders of the African World".
>>cmn_Hant<< The city has obvious differences from other cities in the country because it prefers to possess Arab rather than African styles.

It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is also considered the flagship attraction of the South African National Park (SANParks).
>>cmn_Hant<< Like all South African National Parks, this park has a daily conservation and entry fee.
Perhaps purchasing a Wild Card ticket would be more cost-effective, allowing you to access certain selected parks in South Africa, or all national parks in South Africa.
>>cmn_Hant<< Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and a tourist priority for many travellers.
>>cmn_Hant<< Some say that a whole line of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline, under the lining of the seawater of Victoria Harbour, is like a glossy long strip chart.
>>cmn_Hant<< To enjoy the best view of Hong Kong, you can leave Hong Kong Island and head to Kowloon Waterfront on the opposite shore.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the new land of Hai Po on the northern coast.
>>cmn_Hant<< The British colonists took this place as existing, so it was a good starting point to look for evidence of colonial history on this land.
Sudaban is the largest coastal mangrove forest belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to Bangladesh and the Indian interior.
>>cmn_Hant<< Sundabans Forest is listed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site.The area located within India is known as Sundabans National Park.

Since 1966, Sudaban has been a wildlife preserve, with an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 plum deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (the opposite side of the river) all day, but most buses leave between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those to the east and Jacar/Bumtang.
>>cmn_Hant<< Due to the frequent availability of inter-area buses, it is recommended that you purchase tickets a few days in advance.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most of the area can be reached by a comfortable solid Japanese Coaster bus.
>>cmn_Hant<< Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 nu) and Punaka (200 nu).
>>cmn_Hant<< The Oapoque River Bridge is a slanted bridge spanning the Oapoque River, connecting Oapoque in Brazil to Saint George de Oapoque in French Guiana.
>>cmn_Hant<< The two towers are up to 83 meters high and 378 meters long, and the two lanes are 3.5 meters wide respectively.
>>cmn_Hant<< The vertical spacing under the bridge was 15 m. The work was completed in August 2011 but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned for September 2017 - that is, when the Brazilian Customs checkpoint is scheduled to be completed - to be fully operational.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Guarani were the most important indigenous people living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living a half-hunting life, while also engaged in subsistence farming.

The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is worth about the same as the British Pound (GBP).
>>cmn_Hant<< The only bank on the islands is located in Stanley, opposite the "Falkland Islands Company (FIC) West Shop", the only place to be able to exchange currency.
>>cmn_Hant<< All parts of the islands generally accept British pound sterling and often credit cards and US dollars within Stanley's territory.
>>cmn_Hant<< The Outer Island region may be able to use British and American currency, but credit cards should not be available; ask the merchant in advance to determine which payment method is available.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is almost impossible to redeem its currency outside the Falkland Islands, so be sure to complete the exchange before leaving.
>>cmn_Hant<< Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when winter is in the northern hemisphere, it is summer and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region, with temperatures often exceeding 30 degrees Celsius in summer.
>>cmn_Hant<< Winter chills there can sometimes be deceiving, as temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind, combined with humidity, makes people feel much colder than what is shown on the thermometer.
>>cmn_Hant<< Without a specific "rainy season" and "dry season", the rains are roughly evenly distributed throughout the year.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is wild after all, and should not feed or disturb them.
>>cmn_Hant<< Park authorities noted that at least 100 yards/meter should be maintained with bears, wolves, and 25 yards/meter with other wild animals.
>>cmn_Hant<< No matter how gentle they look, bison, moose, moose, bears and almost all large animals are aggressive.
Dozens of tourists are injured each year because they do not maintain proper distance.
>>cmn_Hant<< In addition, be aware that the smell will attract bears and other wild animals, so please avoid carrying or cooking foods that have a strong odor and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, a town located on the island of Upolu with a population of nearly 40,000 people.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
>>cmn_Hant<< In 1889 there was a notoriously distant naval standoff at this port, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All but one of the British ships sank, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
>>cmn_Hant<< During the course of the struggle for independence organized by the Maú movement, the main chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed in a peace rally in the town.
Auckland spans two seaports, so it has many beaches.The most popular beach is located in three areas.
>>cmn_Hant<< The North Shore Beach (North Harbour District) is located along the Pacific coast, extending from Long Bay Road in the north to Devonport in the south.
>>cmn_Hant<< Almost all of those places are sandy beaches that allow people to swim safely, and most have shades provided by New Zealand Christmas trees.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tamaki Avenue Beach is located in the Port of Whitematta, in the high-class suburb of Mission Bay with St. Helier in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with rowed shops. It's safe to swim here.
>>cmn_Hant<< The main local beer is "first", which is not a beer with a complex taste, but a beer with a smooth and refreshing finish.The other local beer is called a "manta".
>>cmn_Hant<< Although there are also many French wines, New Zealand and Australian wines may be comparable to long-distance transport.
>>cmn_Hant<< Local tap water is very safe to drink directly, but it is also easy to buy bottled water if not reassured.
For Australians, "white coffee" is an exotic idea. Espresso is "espresso" and cappuccino is high cream (non-bubble), while tea is milk-free.
>>cmn_Hant<< The levels of hot chocolate meet Belgian standards.The juices are expensive, but they are very good to drink.
>>cmn_Hant<< Many people travel to the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and few are injured as a result.

From October to April, tank jellyfish appear near the beach and estuary on the north side of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans.
>>cmn_Hant<< Bay crocodiles are not active in the ocean and their main habitat is the northern estuaries of Rockhampton.

>>cmn_Hant<< Travel agencies usually work with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation through travel agencies, such as camping sites.
>>cmn_Hant<< Package trips provided by travel agencies usually include breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and even provide packages that combine flights and hotels.
>>cmn_Hant<< They can also reserve reservations for you if you need time to consider the proposal or to collect other documents (such as visas) for your destination.
>>cmn_Hant<< However, if you encounter any problems that need improvement or any requirements, you should contact the travel agent first, not directly at the hotel.
>>cmn_Hant<< In some festivals, most visitors to music festivals will choose to camp on the spot, and most of them think it is an important part of the experience.
>>cmn_Hant<< If you want to watch events from a close range, you have to go in early and find a camping spot close to the music playing.
>>cmn_Hant<< Please remember that even if the music performance on the main stage is over, it is possible that the music festival's performance elsewhere will continue into the late night.
>>cmn_Hant<< For families with young children, some festival venues arrange specific camping areas.

St. Petersburg Cruise includes sightseeing within the city. Passengers on board are not required to have a visa (check the relevant regulations).
>>cmn_Hant<< Casinos usually make a lot of effort to keep the guests longer and spend more; there are usually no windows and clocks, and it's hard to find exits.
>>cmn_Hant<< They usually provide special meals, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and keep the latter on the scene.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness reduces judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
>>cmn_Hant<< Anyone who wants to drive at high altitudes or is going to drive on a road in the mountains should consider how much chance they have of experiencing snowfall, freezing or temperatures below freezing points.
>>cmn_Hant<< On icy and snow-filled roads, friction is low and you can't drive as you would on plain asphalt.
>>cmn_Hant<< During a blizzard, extremely short periods of time can drop enough snow to keep you from moving.
>>cmn_Hant<< Snowing or high blowing snow, condensation effects or freezing on the car windows can make visibility less.
>>cmn_Hant<< On the other hand, in many countries, the ice climate is very common and traffic is almost unimpeded throughout the year.
>>cmn_Hant<< Hunting can be said to be the most attractive tourist element in Africa, and the focus of many visitor journeys.
>>cmn_Hant<< The term "Safari" generally refers to the appreciation of spectacular African wildlife, particularly savanna-based land trips.
>>cmn_Hant<< Elephants and giraffes such animals tend to approach the car, so standard equipment allows you to see more clearly.
>>cmn_Hant<< Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes afraid of people approaching, and are more suitable for observation with binoculars.
>>cmn_Hant<< Wild hiking tours (also known as jungle walks, wild hiking or hiking) contain mountain climbing, and the length of the trip can be hours or days.

Most activity tickets are expected to fall between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, and the general fare is about 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes helps with dry clothes. Many hotels can borrow from the hotel even without irons and ironing boards.
>>cmn_Hant<< If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing an ironed sock, then you can try using a blow dryer to blow dry socks, if you have one.
>>cmn_Hant<< Be careful not to allow the temperature of the fabric to be too high (which may lead to shrinkage, or burning in extreme cases).
>>cmn_Hant<< In many ways of purifying water, some can deal with specific threats more effectively.
>>cmn_Hant<< In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
>>cmn_Hant<< The effectiveness of the filter varies, and if you have any concerns, you may wish to purchase sealed bottled water from reputable companies.
>>cmn_Hant<< Visitors may encounter animal pests that are uncommon in their home country.
>>cmn_Hant<< Pests can damage food, induce discomfort, and worse words can cause allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infectious diseases.

>>cmn_Hant<< If you are not used to driving on rural roads, keep your head clear: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp bends make up the vast majority.
The speed limit announcement is significantly lower than the previous and next sections, typically 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and strict compliance with these speed limits is even more important than other sections.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is curious, however, that mobile communication services here are much stronger than other sections along the way, such as Penn State Wildland.
>>cmn_Hant<< German pastries are delicious, while Bavarian pastries are rich and diverse, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
>>cmn_Hant<< Fruit pastries are common, apples are often made into pastries, and cherries and plums appear at the dinner table in the summer.
Many German baked goods often contain almonds, hazelnuts and other woody nuts.
If you're looking for a small, full-bodied snack, try a deep-fried jam bag that has different names depending on the region: Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.

Indonesian cuisine, made up of more than 17,000 island foods, is a general term that covers the country's wide variety of regional dishes.
>>cmn_Hant<< But if used in cases where there are no other words of refinement, this term usually refers to food originating in the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.

>>cmn_Hant<< Horses were used to support the rider's legs hanging on both sides of the saddle.
>>cmn_Hant<< They bring more stability to the knight, but it is possible that the knight's foot will get stuck, and therefore there is a safety concern.
>>cmn_Hant<< If the knight falls off the horse's back but one foot stuck in the horse's jaw, they may be dragged as the horse runs off.To minimize this risk, many safety precautions can be taken.
>>cmn_Hant<< First, most riders wear horse boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.

>>cmn_Hant<< The concept of skiing has long existed, and cave murals have depicted skiers as early as the 5000th year before the Western Yuan.
Mountain skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
>>cmn_Hant<< Ski backpackers: This event is also known as mountain skiing, ski tours or ski mountaineering.
>>cmn_Hant<< This activity is similar to Alpine mountaineering, but usually does not involve alpine skiing and mountaineering, and these two activities take place in steep terrain requiring stronger snowboarding and snow boots.
>>cmn_Hant<< Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
>>cmn_Hant<< When in good condition, the snow load slips will be slightly longer than hiking, but you rarely reach the speed of non-heavy cross-country skiing on the clearing slopes.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although relatively small, many independent countries exist in mainland Europe.In general, traveling between several countries represents the need to apply for several visas and go through multiple passport checks.
>>cmn_Hant<< However, in this respect, the Schengen Area operates like a country.
>>cmn_Hant<< As long as you stay in the area, in general, there is no need to pass the passport control checkpoint again to access the border.
>>cmn_Hant<< Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply separately for each Schengen Member State's visa, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
What artifice belongs to antiques does not have a quasi-standard definition. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
>>cmn_Hant<< Different geographic regions have different definitions, and in places such as North America, the age limit may be shorter than in Europe.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although the existence of handicrafts is shorter than other mass-produced goods of the same type, it is possible that they will be identified as antiques.
>>cmn_Hant<< For the Sami, the feeding of deer is an important livelihood, and for the many dossamis of other specialists, the periphery culture of the deer industry is equally important.
>>cmn_Hant<< However, even traditionally, not all Sami people engage in large-scale reindeer animal husbandry, instead living off fishing, hunting and similar activities, and regard reindeer as a service animal for pulling weights and backs.
>>cmn_Hant<< Many Sami people today are engaged in modern industry.The tourism industry is an important source of income in the Sami region.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although the term "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romeans, it is often considered obnoxious due to the negative stereotypes and incorrect understanding of the roms.
>>cmn_Hant<< If the country you are visiting is restricted by travel advice, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
>>cmn_Hant<< In addition to your own queries, you may also want to consult with the government, but their advice is designed for its citizens.
>>cmn_Hant<< For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
>>cmn_Hant<< Advice is just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
>>cmn_Hant<< Compared to the detailed information available elsewhere, the views they provide are often more crude, caged and oversimplified.

>>cmn_Hant<< If someone has a plan to travel to countries that are considered war zones, it should be for professional training.
>>cmn_Hant<< Searching for "hostile environment courses" on the Internet will presumably find the address of the local company.
>>cmn_Hant<< Classes are usually presented in a more detailed, often hands-on way to illustrate all the issues discussed here.
>>cmn_Hant<< Classes are usually for a period of 2 to 5 days, and will involve role-playing, extensive first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
>>cmn_Hant<< Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications involving war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to travel abroad for transgender surgery.
Governments do not necessarily want to issue unspecified gender (X) passports, or update documents for people who want specific names and genders.
>>cmn_Hant<< The extent to which governments are willing to recognize these documents varies greatly.
After September 11, 2001, security checkpoint searches became more stringent.
>>cmn_Hant<< Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to be able to pass a scanner in privacy and dignity without damage.
>>cmn_Hant<< Off-shore currents are waves that break back after a wave hits a beach, and usually appear near a reef or similar.
>>cmn_Hant<< Depending on the underwater topology, recurrent waves will concentrate in a few darker areas and may produce rapid currents here to the deep water areas.
>>cmn_Hant<< Most of the causes of death are due to exhaustion when trying to swim back against currents, and the success rate of this move can be very slim.
>>cmn_Hant<< Once you get out of the current, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than usual.
>>cmn_Hant<< Try to swim to a place that will no longer be trapped, or, depending on the individual's swimming skills and whether or not one has noticed, can also wait for rescue.
>>cmn_Hant<< Reverse cultural impact occurs faster than cultural impact (less honeymoon phase) and lasts longer and more severely.
>>cmn_Hant<< For tourists who are easily adapted to the new culture, it is particularly difficult to sometimes realign the native culture integrated into themselves.
>>cmn_Hant<< After living abroad for a period of time, you have adapted to the new culture and have forgotten certain habits that domestic culture allows you to develop.
>>cmn_Hant<< When you first arrive abroad, others know that it takes time for travellers to adapt to the unfamiliar country, and most will treat you with patience and understanding.
>>cmn_Hant<< But for homecoming excursions, people may feel that there's no need to take care of and understand them anymore.
>>cmn_Hant<< The pyramid sound-light show is one of the most interesting things in the region for children.

>>cmn_Hant<< The picture is presented on the pyramid, and the light on the other pyramids is lit.
Several countries have declared the South Shetland Islands their territory in 1819, with the most bases on this island and 16 in use in 2020.
The largest island is King George Island, which is home to the town of Las Estrellas, the human settlement.
>>cmn_Hant<< Other islands include Livingston Island and Disepson Island, which in turn is an eruptive vent of an active volcano, forming a spectacular natural seaport after being submerged by water.
>>cmn_Hant<< Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the peninsula, bounded by the high elevation of the sea of Bellings.
The peninsula's mountains converge here, then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth 360-kilometre Ellsworth Mountains, which the Minnesota Glacier divides into two.
Mount Vincennes, the highest mountain in Antarctica, is 4892 meters above sea level and is located in northern Antarctica, or Sentine Ridge.
>>cmn_Hant<< In remote areas where cell phone signals cannot be reached, you may only have access to satellite telephones.
>>cmn_Hant<< Generally, satellite phones cannot be substituted for mobile phones because you must be outdoors and align with the satellite to make calls.
>>cmn_Hant<< Ships (including pleasure boats and expedition ships with remote data and audio needs) often use this service.
>>cmn_Hant<< Your local telecommunications service provider should be able to provide more information connected to this service.
>>cmn_Hant<< For those who plan the gap year, the increasingly popular option is to travel and study.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is particularly popular for graduating students, allowing them to have a one-year holiday without having to sacrifice their studies before graduating from college.
>>cmn_Hant<< Many times, attending an empty year course abroad can actually improve your chances of receiving higher education upon your return home.
>>cmn_Hant<< In general, attending these teaching programs must pay tuition.
>>cmn_Hant<< Finland is a very suitable place for rowing.Finland, known as the Land of a Thousand Lakes, also sits on thousands of mid-lake or coastal islands.
>>cmn_Hant<< In islands and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, small boats and even kayaks can provide a different experience.
>>cmn_Hant<< Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is in line with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is quite special in other regions (e.g. 1 for 40 in the Netherlands).
>>cmn_Hant<< Most Baltic Sea-specific cruises will have more stops in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
>>cmn_Hant<< In other words, you can spend several whole days walking this historic city and returning to the ship at night to spend the night.
If you are travelling on a cruise ship, you do not need an additional visa (as of 2009).
>>cmn_Hant<< Some of the cruise itinerary manuals introduce Berlin, Germany. As shown in the map above, Berlin is not dependent on the sea, so the cost of visiting the city is not included in the cruise fee.
>>cmn_Hant<< Air travel can be a terrible experience, regardless of age or background, especially for people who have not been on an airplane or have had a traumatic experience.
>>cmn_Hant<< It's not a shame: it's no different than many people fear or loathe certain specific things.
>>cmn_Hant<< For some people, knowing how the aircraft works and what happens in flight may help them overcome their fears based on unknown or uncontrollable factors.
Fast delivery of goods to the delivery company. Time is very important when shipping commercial documents, merchandise or parts for emergency repairs.
>>cmn_Hant<< Larger companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but other routes or smaller companies will be more troublesome.
