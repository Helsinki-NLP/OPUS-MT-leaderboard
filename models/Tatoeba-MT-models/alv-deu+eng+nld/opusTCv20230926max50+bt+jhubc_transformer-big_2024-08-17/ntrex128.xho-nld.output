Members of the Assembly (AMs) of Wales are concerned about the appearance of stupidity
There are sensitive AMs because it is recommended to change the way they are called MWPs (A member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is because there are plans to change the name of the convention to the Parliament of Wales.
All political parties are concerned about what is going to happen.
According to one member of Labor, his team is concerned that the way the new name is close to the so-called "Twp" and "Pwp."
For a non-violent student in Wales: In Welsh you are speaking snippets of language.
According to the Welsh Association, the whole organization is not interested in this, and suggests in other words.
According to a Welsh Conservative member, his team has no problem with the change of name, but has found that it is easier to call the MWP in the way you call a fool.
in this case the synonym of the syntax is the same as in English as the syntax.
p. The Assembly Commission, tasked with enforcing the legislation on changing the name to the new, said: "The decision of how to call members of the Assembly will be taken by members of itself."
The Government of Wales Act 201<0x37> authorized the Welsh assembly to have changed its name.
In June, the Commission released the results of human responses and found that the majority supported the fact that the convention had changed to what was called the Palemant of Wales.
In the context of how to call AMs, the Commission loves that the Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but people still support this MWP.
v. AMs are said to suggest otherwise, but the difficulty in compromising the issue must be a problem for Elin Jones, the Controller Officer, who is expected to make a rule for changes in the coming weeks.
the legislation of change will also include other factors that will be changed as the way the assembly works, including laws to stop the AMs and how the committee system is organized.
In this case, the AMS votes will be finalized when it comes to the question of how they will be asked.

In order to make money for the employers who are specialized in order to be able to advise.
in which our different products are designed to be ready for each requirement, creating a person looking for a place where they are easy to find, now we're an interesting cosmetic area and that's not just how to buy an old one."

Indonesia's tsunami and tsunamis are causing the toll of the tsunami
after the Lombok earthquake, for example, other non-governmental organizations were reported to be unnecessary.
Even though 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, the area has not been declared as a disaster, which would result in the world's assistance.

President Joko Wido put forward something to improve the infrastructure of Indonesia's deteriorating developments when he was intensifying election support, and has spent a lot of money on repairing the roads and railroads.
However, the lack of funding has taken the government of Mr. Joko as they will be re-elected next year.
and Mr. Joko is facing the stress of the indigenous crisis in Indonesia, where many Muslim members have entered the mainstream of this service.
and more than 1,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been forced to leave homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought on the streets using turbans, spears, and shields, and other dangerous weapons.

"Why don't I get out of it?"
the Nationals have already informed them that they are starting on Sunday, but have made a statement of encouragement so that Scherzer can speak in such a situation.

Trump's Tales in West Virginia
the President refers indirectly to the situation around the person elected to the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republican nomination he votes for a medieval election.
"We've been out in November.
the last five weeks before the historical elections and the most important of our time.
"This is a great election, a great one — I'm not running away and I'm really out of here that's what I'm everywhere trying to find people who will stand for us right," he said.
Trump said, "You see the bad things, the bad things of the Democrats' violent group, you see them happening at the moment.
and he is committed to taking control over them by any means which he sees is appropriate, cruel, merciless.
They don't care if anyone who hurts them, who will walk more than they are, so that they can get the power to control and manage, and that's the only thing they want to do with the power to control, we can't give them that."
According to the Democrats, they said, in a press release on a mission to "struggle and distract."
"And you have seen what has happened in the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "for the anger of the cruelty and the injustices and the truth."
he referred to the Senate Executive Committee on the Senate level of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein in his name, where he received appeals to the viewers.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Are you going to bring a smile?
Uhhhh, what is it?
"No, no, I'm looking forward to another <0xE2><0x80><0x93> that's what it's about the body - talking about the worst thing I've never seen before."
Labour is still in the church.
It's hard to talk to those who think
while the Montenegro's activists in my local group voted against me, I would be suspicious.
After all, I'm a key figure in the list of the Labour MPs to be told unconventionally - they all talk about what they think.
"I have a great deal of the work of Joan the king of the Jews, but I am very eager to do the work of his hands.
in my case, the situation of my criticism and dissent is that I am not incompatible with Jeremy Corbyn.
to the important policy of the effective economic system, the national security, the European Union, by passing on neutral issues where Jeremy disagrees with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting announcement on Friday writes that "we want the meetings to be integrated and had the right results."
In nearly all of these eight years, I am a local MP, the GC evening meetings lasted for the past few years.
So where it's bad today, today's meeting is not an integrated meeting with which we often have "personal and soft, low-budget" politics to run away, however, they can start again.
it seems to be an ever-group of opinions that are not accepted into the Labour Party and all views are reviewed before being accepted into the specialist group.
is that which began after Jeremy's entry into the executive chair, such as his colleague and former colleagues I had thought to share with him with a relative opinion of his political and political expectations that I would quickly turn around and take the places that I did not agree to agree with - even with the safety of the other or even the administrative.
Whenever I speak out- and what I don't matter too - I'm going to follow the banning of the socialist websites that are said to be brought to the seat, to be accepted by the politics of the institution, I'm told that I don't have to be part of the Labour Party.
That's my experience.
And so, I know I'm much happier than others I'm working with as the commissions brought to me directly have been popularly politically.
I respect the art and determination of my workmates who face the tolerance of homosexuality or ethnicity every day but can't get away with it.
is one of the most depressing factors in the political era is the way in which the degrees of opposition have always been commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party has taken into account the culture of endurance.
the truth is that it is not your great cake and in the form of "unpredictable" or changing the principles of the gangsters.
I've had a lot of suggestions over the past two years asking me to let you go, not to talk about it and then "it's all right."
But that's not what I'm doing in politics.
when I was about to join Labour in the 32 year as a schoolboy, being held by the government of Thatcher, you don't care about not leaving the room I've been reading to the ground, since I pledged that I would fight for the best public services and those that I don't need, most not even if I've been a victim or a manager.
I've never hidden my political involvement, including the previous election.
no one in the East of Nottingham can be confused about any way around my place in my police, and in the places I disagree with the current leaders.
in these situations that are upgraded now on Friday, in all of which I am as if Brexit is influenced by harming you in the household, in business and our social services, I do not understand his desire to spend time and my confidence in the leader of the Labour party.
one of the best is that one message I'm not going to the Nottingham Momentum, you'll be my people, whether they're members of the Labour or not: I'm proud to work under you and promise that there's no price left to fear or political help can prevent me from doing what I believe that your sins are for you.

Ayr 38 - 1<0x37> Melrose: Ayr advances
the late two tries have blessed the latest finals almost leading to the results, but there is no doubt that Ayr should have this excellent victory for the Centennial's Premiership.
Now it is upgraded, the most important part of it.
and ultimately, it was their high-quality protection, the likelihood of their chance to take a better chance, resulting in the success of the domestic side with coach Peter Murchie.
"We've been tested in our games so far, and we're not beaten yet, so it should be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Thank Ayr, they did better than we did."
Grant Anderson in histry was in 14 minutes, replaced by Frazier Climo, who put Ayr ahead of time, but, the yellow card of the Scottish cap replacing Rory Hughes, was released by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to make the beads.
Agriculture to curb Ayr's leadership with penalty, before, during the half-time of the game, has added an article and then changed the try to make 1<0x37>-5 to Ayr during rest.
but Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's car, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the chance of five points.
has been said that xhaa has long been due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who has been released with a brand, and when Ayr's redevelopment has rapidly risen over the street of Stafford McDowall, which is converted by Agriculture.
Ayr's holding captain Blair Macpherson has been given a yellow card, and, again, Melrose has paid another man with the unincorporated streets of Bruce Colvine, under strong pressure.
to be returned home, however, and when Struan Hutchinson is given a yellow card due to aiming for Agrimo with no ball outside the penalti line, MacPherson went to sleep behind as an Ayr.
Cumming has changed, as almost since it was started again, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's balls into the box and sent the flagship Gregor Henry away by installing the fifth tray.

"Our Sea": Bolivia trapped on the earth hopes that the road will open the way to the Pacific
The ships are the capitals of the massifs in La Paz.
and the breeches of the earth shall be cut off from the face of the earth.
From Lake Titica to the Amazon Bottoms, they say, "Our sea is legal.
We'll get our job again."
to all of Bolivia trapped on the earth, the maritime memories taken by Chile in a war on the world's rich supply of bloodshed in the 19th century have spread the mind - as it is in the desire to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
the prospects may have risen in the best way for centuries, as Bolivia awaits the world's judicial hearing on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolivia is powerful, the spirit of unity and calm, and awaits the good spirit of the results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
many people in Bolivia will hear the judgment of the World Constitutional Court on large screens all over the world, hoping the Hague court will stand on the Bolivian claim that - after decades of years it has been relocated - Chile is forced to assume by giving Bolivia a landmark.
Evo Morales, president of Bolivia who lives and relatives there - who is facing a re-election in the coming year - also has a lot to do with this Monday sentence.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said in late August.
But some analysts think that it is unlikely to be a trial on the side of Bolivia - nothing will change so much.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> The United Nations organization based in the Netherlands has the ability to extract Chilean soil, and said that it could not know the results of potential talks.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> The judgment of the World Court of Justice comes only six months after the debate suggests that this case was "unquestionable," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in world law.
And rather than in cooperation with Bolivia's wishes, four years may have reverted.
"The sea level has been covered by the existing government of Bolivia," said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
In the words of Morales, they ended any kind of kindness in Chile," he said.
Bolivia and Chile will speak again one day, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after that.
and these two countries have not been able to co-operate since 19<0x36>2.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, has uncovered the court's decision in a very rare manner.
Monday will give Bolivia a "special opportunity to reveal on the new collaborative page of Chile" and "to end 139 years of inconsistencies have made profits," he said.
Calzadilla is also proud of the fact that Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - uses this aspect of the sea as a political proponent.
"Bolivia will not simply cease its right to reach the Pacific Ocean," she said.
"This is an opportunity to see if we have to overcome the things that have happened in the past."
North Korea says it will not abandon nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States
North Korean Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not be able to separate its nuclear weapons from Washington first.
Rai said on Saturday at the United Nations Legislative Assembly.
he asked the United States to follow the promises made during a conference in Singapore among the leaders facing eye movements.
he speaks of these words as soon as the President of the State Mike Pompeo seems to have resumed a nuclear deal more than three months after those of Singapore and Kim Jong Un in North Korea.
RI says it's a "distinct" day that its continued engagement with the United States is a proposal that puts an end to the Korean War and will allow the North to surrender.
is Washington willing to accept this agreement before Pyongyang began to take action to separate these devices.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are looking for a second meeting.
but many people doubt that Pyongyang is willing to sacrifice the weapons considered by the country as the only way to ensure that it is safe.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a meeting with Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows show with various recent trends that you will see on the streets of the nearest town.

the designers Valentino and Thomas Browne have begun to create a wide range of very unusual SS19 exhibits that have relaxed alongside the floor set on the Paris Fashion Week.
This nightmare has been stunning to Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent these shocking messages to the public.
It's all about Valentine's syndrome, and it's all over the slot.

But Thomas Browne came up with a series of amazing masks at the time of Nohenepen.
many of these colorful masks are sturdy, and are similar to Hannibal Lecter than unwanted fashions.
One of the symptoms would be like to enter into the water with a respiratory substance while the other was like a coconut syrup of a soluble rice.
And if you want to enjoy the raw materials, you're lucky.
They say that the suspension of the suspension of the symptoms of the symptoms of the symptoms of the symptoms of the symptoms.
This is the main diameter in the La Bomba', a two-story diametered by Rinah and Emily Ratajkowski's two-story diameter.

is a white-eyed raffle, white-tailed white-white skirt, leading to the collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 on the Paris Fashion Week.
"I'm looking forward to seeing big boots and beach bags coming to people in the next summer - as designers of the new designer Luke Armitage will be difficult to avoid people who will be looking for these great things."
John Edward: The Important Language Skills for People of the World
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Scottish independent schools have a reputation for advanced education, and this has continued in 2018 with other results of non-examination exams, which are bolstered by each individual and the success of the sporting, art, music and other human campaigns.
as they have over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), try to provide high quality service to their students and parents.
in which independent schools try to prepare their students when they go to higher education levels, their private subjects, and their place as a world-living people.
as part of the education sector that can design and incorporate a school curriculum suitable for circumstances, we see existing languages continue as a popular and necessary school curriculum.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a tongue, you can reach your mind.
"If you talk to him in his language, he will speak to you."
this is a powerful reminder that we cannot trust in English to build relationships and trust with foreign nationals.
from the recent results of the exam, we can see that the language is high on the web with a high degree of promotion to independent schools.
<0x36>8<0x25> of foreign-language students have received grades in Higher Grade A.
a collection of information, in <0x37>4 schools members of the SCIS, shows that <0x37>2<0x25> of students had earned Higher grade A in Mandarin, while <0x37>2<0x25> of those who were German, <0x36>9<0x25> of those who were French and those who studied Spanish were <0x36>3<0x25> of the population.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills for children and young people who are looking for confidence in the future.
now languages, such as the preferred subject, are equally valued as STEM courses (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculum and others.
a study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for the reasons given by employers to have difficulty filling posts at work, 1<0x37> percent is associated with the lack of language skills.
and more and more, the ability of the language becomes necessary to prepare young people for the tasks that they will do in the future.
As more work spaces require languages, these skills are important in the cooperative world.
regardless of the job choice, if you learn another language, you will have more time in the future to have a lasting skills like that.
the ability to communicate directly with foreign people has made him a great opportunity for a person who is familiar with many languages.
According to YouGov's 2013 study of adults over 4,000 in the UK, <0x37>5 percent were unable to speak another language well enough to chat and only French said more than 15 percent of the mushrooms, 15 percent.
Therefore, it's important to invest in encrypting language nowadays it's important for modern children.
learning a lot of languages, especially those developing countries, will empower children with the best opportunities to find a job that is exciting.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the language we teach.
is that a number of schools will pay attention to the existing modern languages, while others will teach languages that are thought to be very important in the UK when viewed in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your child likes, there will always be a number of languages that you can choose from independent schools, there are also teachers who are emerging in this section.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Scottish Independent schools are committed to preparing for a teaching environment that will prepare children to prepare them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter where they will go in the future.
and cannot be denied now, in the state of global business, that languages continue to be important in the future of the country, so this should be evident in education.
In fact, today's languages should be viewed as "the ability to communicate with the world."
(ii) Independent schools will continue to offer this option, break-up and relaxation for young people in Scotland.
I'm not going to be a bad guy.

After two days, the Sunday attack is to protect them.
according to North Korea, he says that he “will never” finished his weapons before obtaining security.
the North Korea's foreign institute minister told the United Nations on Saturday that these judgments make it untrustworthy in the United States and there was no way for the United States to complete its Nuclear weapons when they could obtain security guarantees.
Ri Yong Ho told the board of attendees to take good action last year, such as stopping the testing of weapons and the debris of Nuclear-equipped areas, and also making the promise that we can re-enact Nuclear equipment.
"We don't see the same steps that come from the United States," he said.
"If there is no promise from the United States there will be no hope for the safety of our country and in this case we will not destroy our weapons we have not spoken to the United States."
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> While Ri reverts the normal thing North Korea has said about the rejection of the U.S. to complete Nuclear weapons in less than what North Korea has been awarded about the least steps to take, this report has not denied the cause of Pyongyang to complete the wrong equipment.
.Ri spoke of a joint report issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the president of the United States and the president of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work "to complete Nuclear weapons instead of Korea" during Trump's presidential campaign.
North Korea wanted to bring an end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pyong should end Nuclear weapons first.
and Wahington has called for applications to minimize the major international sanctions facing North Korea.
"The U.S. urges "the completion of Nuclear Tools first" and increases the degree of pressure by judgments to achieve their purpose in a compulsory way, defining the declarations of the end of the war," Ri said.
"We don't want to be afraid of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that these sentences are increasing inconsistencies."
Mr Ri said he did not speak about Kim and Trump's conference plans, which the U.S. embassy spoke before the United Nations this week.
Instead of the minister he discusses three meetings between Kim and South Korean director and North Korea Jae-in five months ago and added: "If the team in this case exceeds Nuclear equipment is South Korea and not America, do you decide Nuclear's tools instead of Korea?"
Yet, Ri's speech sounds different than last year, when speaking to a general assembly in the U.N. The focus of North Korea's flying weapons in the U.S. was inevitable after "Mn. Wicked President" Trump calls Kim "a man of flying instruments...
p. this year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened "full destruction" of North Korea, gave Kim the courage to praise for taking steps to evacuate the equipment, but that says it has a lot of key work and sentences will remain far away from North Korea to complete Nuclear equipment.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time for it, saying "if it takes three years, three or three months - it doesn't matter."
According to China and Russia, the U.N. Security Council should call Pyongyang on the measures he took.
Even so, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The proceedings of the Security Council continue in force and not until we see the passing of Nuclear equipment completely and certainly."
the Security Council has increased sentences in accordance with North Korea since 200<0x36> with the intention of the abolition of the Nuclear Flying Systems of Pyongyang.
p. Pompeo is in contact with Ri beyond the U.N. General Assembly and said he will visit Pyong again to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been successful.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that it had a priority made, but North Korea took up the claim that he made "needs like those made for robbers."
the North Korea pledged to meet the Monoon this month so that they could break the Nuclear Flying Tools site that the U.S. is "continuous steps."
said Kim told him that the "conscious measures" he needed for security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and the progress of normal relations with Washington
Harvard students have learned enough rest.
by a new study at Harvard University this year makes all students who are not carrying enough sleep to combat the culture of night-long learning using caffeine.'
One of the experts found that students in the university are not aware of the basics of self-care.
p. Charles Czeisler, a health care provider at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, conducted this study, believing that for the first time that this was in the United States.
He was encouraged by his speech about the effects of insomnia.
"When we finished one of the class of this one girl came and said to him, 'Why are you told me now, I'm going to finish school?'
He told me no one told me that I was going to sleep - that was amazing," he told The Telegraph.
this study was started this year, explaining the benefits of sleeping about the development of education and sport, including improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatrist studies at Harvard Medical School and senior director of university medical services, said the university made the decision to bring the study after receiving students who are not sufficiently adequately adequate.
This is a one-hour study that takes about an hour, including the activities that are consistently enjoyable.
is in one section rather than the image of the university bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, caf<0xC3><0xA9>s, training clothes and books for the purpose of clarifying the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects the development of sports.
in one section, participants were told that insufficient sleep increases the risk of heart attack, peripheral disease, stress disorder, and cancer.
a school map, with symptoms of interest, encourages participants to think about everyday routines.
“We know that we will not change the behavior of the disciples” immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - as you also have the right to know the health consequences of smoking bamboo," said the professor Czeisler added.
is the culture of self-determination not to sleep today, which, he adds that the art of the present day and the pressure on the readers that make them less of a growing problem.
to ensure that sleeping enough should be an unknown tool to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoid obesity, as insomnia causes the brain, has always been hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old living in California who is studying chemical sciences and organics, helped Professor Czeisler to make his class debut, after going to his first class in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the class was open and that it was interesting to make this class available throughout the school.
you hope that the next step is to ask the learners to make the same learning process before they enter the competition center.

Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinsos's dissertation
it is common for days to look at things about Brexit when you're watching an English-speaking movie to be the same as in the revival of the old comedy and sexual violence Johnny English - which was taken from the 2003 revival of Johnny's revival in 2011 is called by Johnny Resh.
Isn't that an exciting movie that will talk about the fact that we can't impress foreign countries?
Johnny English receives a license to revive - this name suggests that you are a vandalized by non-English and non-English-English observers.
he is truly a state's heroic and technological work that makes in a different way is the least of Clouseau, Mr. Bean and at least one of his son's best-selling music articles in the Chariots of Fire at the opening of London's Olimphis in 2012.
he even became a traveler and the world-famous confidential man Atkinson U.S. U.A. continued to promote Barclaycard's television advertisements, which foiled the ske's tensions he walked.
It has one or two times in the movie JE.
I love this time Johnny English came to a helicopter in front of the old security suits during the exploding time they hit his jacket.
as well as Atkinson's gift of laughter that does not express interest, but it is not as powerful compared to heavy products such as 00<0x37> and Mission Impossile which includes symptoms now.
It's not like these to be viewed by children not adults, when talking to the side of Johnny English jokes does not show how much skill compared to Atkinson's angry movies while playing Bean.
The news is that the British are in serious trouble with the British.
the online analyst who has entered an illegal entry on the internet network, saw the details of all the English genres that are working, until they have questioned the identity of the work - Kevin Eldon's very specific role.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> The news comes out with a high-profile minister, who faces the problem of being unpopular as a politician: Emma Thompson tries to do the good as playing Teresa May but the writer of the movie is not well aware of her writing
the wise advisers told him that like all the authorities are at risk, it is necessary to return the retirement person.
And that's what that stupid Johnny English itself, who has found the position of head coaching in school is in a good mood, but he presents illiterate studies of being anonymous man, while English teaches in an unusual way how he is more stylish than the times of tale.
English is returned to Whitehall and has been informed in an emergency with her ex-girlfriend who was suffering from Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is a married man, married to the captain of the underwater ship.
the two who have the ability to do the wrong things in the field of the intelligence services return to work, and then met Ophelia Bulletova who is played by Olga Kurylenko.
and while, the high commissioner believes a billions of technology richer that we can solve these problems of English computers: this evil man, Jason Volts, played by Jake Lacy
b. English and Bough began the brawl: they made food suppliers, burned the French food store; they began problems when boarding Volta's rich ship; and the English brought up an attack while using a worn-out in the head of Virtual Reality for the purpose of learning.
It has been done everything in the final sections, although it is more interesting and fun, than the children's television programs that talk about all this.
It's not normal.
As with all the other movie shows of Johnny English: I wonder if this English film industry is not able to give Rowan Atkinson a good role in his ability?

Gqirr. Ford, I don't know what's going to happen, but that's what I know: Brett has denied you with the strength of these pleasures," added Graham, talking to Chrstine Blasey Ford.
"Everybody who is talking about can make sure of these accusations.
He's 3<0x36> years old.
I don't see change."

the U.S. national defendant accuses China of now ‘abusing' using ‘false advertising'
a week after China's official newspaper made a four-page advertisement in the American newspaper every day talking about the benefits of American and Chinese trade, the U.S. attorney in China accuses the country of using the American media to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week spoke of China Daily's advertising on the DesMoines Register - a very marketing newspaper in Iowa - to face charges against China for its purposes of interfering with the election on November <0x36>, which is the China's lightest.
Trump's claim that China is trying to disrupt the election is something that American officials tell Reuters that a new section of the progressive campaign that the United States has put pressure on China.
and it is common for governments in different countries to incorporate advertisements in order to promote trade, China and the United States are struggling in trade at the moment and incorporating unemployed values.
China also adds values to the start of the trade crisis and is designed to affect foreign goods suppliers in the public sector such as Iowa who are based in the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. representative in China and Iowa's old governor, which imports China into a large portion of the food industry, said, China has injured American employers, farmers, and businesses.
According to China, Branstad wrote his comments on Des Moines Register, "it is now committed to exploiting us by putting false advertisements in our journals free of charge."
"When spreading false news, the Chinese government risks hearing the United States using its traditional tradition of free speech as well as free news and advertising space on the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, instead of the news here in Beijing when you drop the strato, you'll get a little different views and you'll never see how China really thinks about economic advances in China, we think that the media might be the insurgency of China's communist communist group," he wrote.
he added that "one of the most common newspapers in the pool denies his request to release this issue" no matter where the newspaper is.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Republicans oust the predecessors before being elected to half-party Kavanaugh's problem, warning analysts
as the Republicans are in the top position on the side of the High Court's Brett Kavanaugh and protect him from his homicide, sexual abuse, analysts say that they will see the best shots, especially for the men, in the upcoming election of the first half.
in the sense of the situation in which there are so many islands, and the Republicans also say that they want to continue the election.
those things you can't get back," said Grant Reeher, a university professor who teaches political studies at Syracuse University's Maxwell School tells The Hill while a article was released on Saturday.
According to Reeher, he argues that Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s time-consuming efforts to begin FBI research would change the rate of angry voters.
"People who are honest will soon forget what has happened yesterday - they won't be late tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national speaker of the progressive group's Move On Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters again said "Come on November! they went to the rest of the world as Republicans took control of the Justice Committee and decided to continue Kavanaugh's deployment and despite the testimony of the surgeon Christine Blasey Ford, Mic.
"The interest in freedom and encouragement is great," says St. Rothenberg, a non-personal analyst, informing the news center.
"People say it's up to date, it's true.
but it may be much more than this, especially for plaintiffs who don't make a decision as to vote for who and the newest voters are, aged 18-29, who are even more unfamiliar with the nominee but are not uncommon to vote."
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Ford's testimony was previously in a row explaining his accusations regarding the sentencing of the High Court of Sexual Abuse, analysts said that it could be a negative result when Republicans need a guarantee.
"This has responded to the problem with the GOP," says Michael Steele, the former Republican National Commissioner last week when it begins, according to the NBC News.
"It is not important to vote on the committee or the final vote or if Kavanaugh enters into the junction, as to how Republicans are dealing with the situation and whether they are treating it as such," notes Guy Cecil at the news center, director of the Priorities USA, a team that helps to be elected Democrats
However, the denominations do not seem to recognize who believed it between Ford's testimony and Kavanaugh's, although there are a few who take the side of the earrings.
about 41 percent who participated in another survey showed that it is possible to believe or fully believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent indicated that they may be fully or fully believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38<0x25> said that Kavanaugh is likely to be sure that you are lying while giving evidence, at the same time only 30 percent of those who say the same for Ford.
after Flake became interested, the FBI investigates the charges by Ford and another devil, Deborah Ramires, says The Guardian.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Ford has calmed the evidence held before the justice committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted 18 when he was sexually abused by Kavanuagh.
Ramirez accused the high-profile detainee of the Supreme Court of Appeal to him while at the time they were studying at Jay in the 1980s.
the internet developer has developed a plan to create a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, an online producer, begins a new business with a purpose to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
this technology technology has a new Inrupt system, a business that produces Solid as a system that is available to everyone.
Solid allows its users to choose to keep their data in place and to say who is authorized to see those details.
in an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee discusses the purpose of Inrupt's "global control."
"We have to do it now," he said in this business.
"A minute to run away"
This non-technical system allows people to create a "recognition area" or POD.
can include a list of phone numbers, a list of things that you have to do, a calendar, your music, and other personalities and activities.
is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in the same place at the same time.
It is different from the storage area to determine if the user chooses what one can see.
the company calls the "personal patent of knowledge."
the Inrupt plan, according to the top business manager John Bruce, to bring the tools, processes and skills in parallel to make the Solid available to everyone.
the company currently has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a system purchased by IBM, the workers who shove the system and the community of voluntary producers.
Since this week, technology producers around the world can show a system that they have all uniquely done using methods to use them that are available for internet sex.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team do not say "Facebook and Goodle about whether he has not released a major change that can make their business faster.
We don't ask for their permission.
According to Berners-Lee, when writing to Media on Saturday, he stated that Inrupt's purpose is "to provide interesting businesses and places to protect the integrity and quality of the new internet made of Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet while creating the World Wide Web Consortium in the Educational Education of Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
in recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in this discussion of internet neutrality.
when the official opening of Inrupt, Berners-Lee is still to be the producer and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Center and the Open Data Center.
"I am very happy with the new section of the internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Victoria's pastor crosss with WW1
is the first and last thread to get the Victoria Cross during the World War.
Lt. Col. Clergyman Bernard Vann won the appendix on 29 September 1918 while invading in Ballenglise and Lehaucourt.
Nonetheless, he was killed by a handgun who shot to death without knowing that the 4-gun won the highest award in Britain.
The memorial stone was opened by his two grandchildren in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said that an unforgettable visitor was made from a hundred years after his granddaughter received a prize.
according to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Vann paid for men who were under his control to pass the Canal de Saint-<0x51>uentin "a heavy fog and a heavy gun with machine guns."
He ran away from those who fired and with great courage took those big guns and machine guns alone.
Lt Col Vann was killed by Jaliman who had a cat's handgun shot down on 4 October 1918 - more than a month for the war to end.
Michael Vann, who is <0x37>2, says his grandmother's actions are "what he does not know he will never do but he said it is complimentary."
According to his brother Dr James Vann, he and his brother put the history made into a circle after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
According to Michael Vann, he feels "the glory of being a participant" adding that "the hero's bravery of the truth will be reflected by many people who provide great support."
The MMA's clients did not sleep to see Bellator 20<0x36>, but they refused to be puppet only
Think about it now, you don't fall asleep because you want to remember Bellator 20<0x36> just to find out if it doesn't play.
San Jose's long program has 13 warships, including six night-to-night transmissions at Channel 5 in the UK.
at <0x36> a.m., at the time of clashing with Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald, viewers in the UK were surprised when they saw the change of playing Peppa Pig.
Some people were terrified as they stayed all night until morning to see the army.
One of the followers describes this hormones as a bad snack.
"The government's legislation that from <0x36> a.m. this process was still inappropriate for the reason that they had to change the children's unimaginable adoptions," says the representative of the advertising and communications of Bellator, when asked about what happened.
"Pop the Pig," yes.
President of Bellator Scott Coker said they will change their time next so that the UK observers can also watch.
"I think I'm going to play again and again, I think it's possible," said Coker.
"The problem is that the time is <0x36>:00 a.m. by the Sun will not be able to do this until the Sunday of them.
But we're going to have a plan.
I believe that when I change my mind, it's a lot of messages and it's all not fun.
We tried to fix it, and we first thought that our problem was the problem of our machinery.
However, it was not the government's problem.
I promised that I would never return.
We're going to cut more than <0x36>0 times - like we've had - and we're trying to get what we've expected but we've done so much.

Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley feels "little" because of his sex
Olimpian Tom Daley says he has grown young because of his sexuality - but it makes him interesting to succeed.
The 24-year-old said I saw that I was in my second grade that "I'm not different than anyone else."
Speaking of the first Desert Island Discs program conducted by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he says he speaks of the rights of gay people to give them "hope."
He said that he would be a parent to help him to prevent him from winning the Olimpus.
is a familiar manager of the program, Kirsty Young, who has felt months of age due to illness.
from the emergence of Laverne's first-person throw, Daley says that she felt the youngest while growing up because "it's not allowed to love boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, the feelings of feeling a bit more and different, are the most interesting and the ability to succeed."
She wanted to say that "it's something," she said, so she won't let everyone know about her sexuality.
is the winner of this double-value Olympiad who is campaigning publicly at LGBT and has used his reputation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask countries not to make sense of justice.
She said she's saying that she's happy to be able to live without having to deal with problems and that she wants to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that dating with another man - the American film producer in 2013 - "you're not expecting."
Daley is also married to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her last year but says that the post that they have left for themselves has never been a problem.
"When you're dealing with things like you're young" - she goes to her first Olimpiki at the age of 14 and her father died from cancer three years later - she says it was hard to find a same-year-old person facing similar life problems.
the couple became parents in June, finding a son of a young man calling him Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "all his thoughts" have changed.
"You've been asking me a few years ago because I've told you that I needed to ‘get a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, it's more important to finish the Golden Eagles of the Olympiads.
It's a good example of Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the doctor received a psychiatric cancer.
Daley says her dad didn't accept her death and one of the last claims asked if they had any of the 2012 London tickets - as if they wanted to stay ahead.
"I can't say "I don't want to go," he said.
"I've got my hand when I decided to breathe and I saw that he couldn't breathe if he couldn't live forever," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics, earning our medal.
"I've seen that it's what I always dreamed of - the pouring of water before the crowd in the Olympic Games, there's no better way I didn't feel," he said.
It was also interesting to say his first music - the Proud by Heather Small - which always gave him an interest in the face of the chemistry and threatened him.
the Desert Island Discs are found on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's non-league playoff bet in the Ryder Cup game on Saturday.
Mrs. Phil Mickelson is going to make a new record with the Sunday when he plays his 4<0x37>th Ryder Cup game but is forced to change his playing style to make this unhappy record.
Mickelson, who plays in the event that took place twice in the 12th year, is injected into the game by Captain Jim Furyk in the play of 4 balls and 4 people.
instead of being questioned, as usual when playing for America, this five-point winner uses half of his day without playing and rehearsing for the purpose of repairing him to give him a problem.
can't be able to understand even though the game is high, this 48-year-old is not well suited to play at Le Golf National, where the match is present and makes it difficult for bad footballers.
if you become a horrifying playground itself, Mickelson, in the ninth game of the Soto, is dealing with Francesco Molinari who is very lucky British Open football, who has collaborated with Tommy Fleetwood who is still learning to win all of their games on this wiki.
if the Melicans, below with a score of 4. which well starts 12 solo tournaments, Mickelson's play is a great tool.
Fryk showed her confidence in her husband as expected.
"He's fully aware of his role today, he's putting me a bit behind his back and said he'll be ready for tomorrow."
"It's real hope.
You have found a place in a prestigious hall and added a lot to this group of people in the past season, and this week.
I didn't think he could play two games.
I thought he would play more games than he did, but he didn't go the way we thought he was going on.
He wants people to know him, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record of playing many games at the Ryder Cup in the Soccer League.
can make a decision to play on the Ryder Cup that resembles his personal record.
Mickelson won 18 times, was split 20 times into one-and-a-half, even though Furyk had been able to get him to the missing points in the group.
"You're funny, you're smiling, quick response, you like to laugh at people, and you're someone who's laughing to be with him in the group's room" clarifying.
"I'd like to see young players cheering up on this weekend to see what they'd like to see."
"He gave me a gift."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows that it's going to lose the position of forward quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe knows that we can quickly lose the position of forward as a team progresses in the Ryder Cup but that can change at any time.
the playoffs began to play in 199<0x37> in the Valderrama game, where the Severe Ballestros side advanced by five points than the United States but it also ended, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>3<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 in.
"You will tell you that you have a lot of articles in Valderrama; you have many articles in Brookline, where it is eaten along with Valderrama, where the win is, hard," Bjorn, which is installed in the picture, after watching the 2018 kilometre won by 5-3 Friday and Level 10 column
It will teach you and all of us that this is not the case.
Let's get rid of all tomorrow
We will do what we can to do.
This has not yet been completed until the end of the board.
We have a purpose, and it is to try to win this province.
"I've also said, I'm focusing on 12 players on my side, but we know we're going to deal with anything in one of the same places - the players who've learned all over the world."
He was delighted to have played in this tough playground, Bjor added: "I didn't really think about it.
Tomorrow we are talking about something different.
The next day is looking for personal playing skills, and something is different.
It's important to have a mate when things go well, but when you're alone, you start testing your energy as a golfer.
This is a message for the players to get to know each other tomorrow.
Now you're not going to be able to get your partner back."
in contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk's sideman Jim Furyk is looking for his players to play well for themselves and not as a team, except for Jordan Apeith and Justin Thomas, who won three-and-a-half points.
Furyk and you've never been the second of the last day's revolutions, became next to Brookline when the win and the time being split as Europe performs "the miracle in Medinah."
"I remember everything he didn't say," replied Ben Crenshaw captain in 1999, how did he get them interested while they were leaving the last one.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but we should not be able to imagine what you've seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When you start to win every day, it puts pressure on the game.
We prepare our players in the field and put them in a way that will have good results, you know, we want to make a magic tomorrow."
Thomas is given a tribute job to restore the army and deal with Rory McIlroy in high-profile sports, dealing with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter Yurpohu's high-speed elite.
"I'm going with this team because I think it's all about it," Bjorn said in this group's choice of individuals.
The battleship of Germany has been re-entered.
a new juliman ship should not be released in 2014 to replace the Cold War warship, but even the following year it would not be released due to shipping problems and prices, the news reports are available.
the release of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," a paid ship that was produced by Baden-Wutermberg-class frigates, was postponed in the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which said the military spokesman.
the ship should not be entered into the navy in 104, but the coming of goods has done so.

it was possible to draw a great powerful tool, as well as torpedoes for other ships and jets and other technologies that would make them invisible to Radar, infrared and acoustic.
One of the most important factors is that it takes a long time before the need to be adjusted - it can go for two years all at home.
Nevertheless, continuous disruptions make new ships - which are said to give Jalimaine an overseas power - and they are outdated when they are pulled out.
the brewery was issued in the news reports last year, while the German navy objected to evacuation the ship officially returned it to Blom <0x26> Voss in Hamburg
It was the first time the ship had returned to the manufacturer after it was shipped.
a little is known about the reasons for the repatriation of the ship but the German news suggests that it has problems with "frames and clothing" that makes the ship efficiently efficiently making the ship unused during the war.
The machinery is more open as the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships are used by 120 people at all - half of people forced to use Old Bremen.
the other, it appears that this ship has a very heavy weight to reduce its capabilities and that the navy will not fail to improve in the future.
the <0x37>,000-square-foot "IRheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be a couple passing ships such as those that were used for gradients in the second world war.

<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.<0x36>bn) - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion
the problems of new ships are also important when the decreasing effect of the Jalimanian naval force is on the rise.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, a commissioner of the Jaliman coastal defence committee, agreed that the Navy would lose the battleships.
According to the reporter, the problem of old age has continued, since old ships have been removed from the military but not new.
He said that no one of the ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg was able to enter the navy.

According to the report, it was estimated that he was <0x24>3<0x37>5,000 to hit the damages, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on Instagram, which spreads to its 142 million followers just a few hours after the charges were made, Ronaldo, a 33-year-old, argued that "false."
"No, only, but only.
That's what's said today, it's absolutely false," the Balloon's 5th-minute winner said on the camera.
They want to know people about my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by my name, but it's common now.
"I'm happy and happy," he added.
According to Ronalo's attorneys, they seek to detain Der Spiegel from these allegations that they have "extraordinarily reported on allegations of personal life," according to Reuters.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, the player wants to be "spiritually hurt because of the abuse of personal rights in the past decades."
this event is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a hotel called Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

Ronaldo had previously entered Real Madrid from Manchester United while the incident occurred on the charges, and in this case went to a large group of Italian Juventus sold for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: The UK will "forever regret" for the loss of automobile manufacturers
<0xE2><0x96><0xBA> The UK will "forever regret" if it does not lose its promotional position in the production of cars after Brexit, says machine secretary Greg Clark.
he added that you were worried that Toyota in the UK told the BBC that Britain could travel to the EU by side of the negotiation will be less likely to produce their day in Burnaston, up to Derby.
"We need a link," says Mr. Clark.
According to the Japanese automotive manufacturer, the expert on not leaving clothes on the border when not a link to Brexit could complete the work.
Burnaston Products <0xE2><0x80><0x93> produces Toyota Auris and Avensis <0xE2><0x80><0x93> produced nearly 150,000 cars in the past year that 90 percent of the imports were exported to the European Union.
"It's my idea that if the British moves to the EU at the end of the March we'll see the production stop in our production," said Marvin Cooke, the Toyota's governing authority in Burnaston.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Some UK automotive manufacturers have declared their fear of traveling in the EU with no connection to how trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its production of Mini in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
a serious concern about this can also lead to the risk of transactions when there is no link to Brexit.
the Toyota production listing is carried out with a "timely arrival" system, with car goods arriving every 3<0x37> minutes from retailers from the UK and the EU for the purpose of cars being produced for the purpose of being bought immediately.
If the UK goes to the EU without a share of 29 March, it may be a limit limitation in which the industry may be susceptible to unwanted goods and goods.
Toyota will never be able to have their Derbyshire production day, says the industry, and the production will stand.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for relations with the EU was "in order not to deal with this problem of diagnosing the border."
"We need a consensus. We need a very good combination that will allow us to take this opportunity," tells BBC Radio 4 on the network called Today.
"The evidence not only comes from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers explains that we need to continue where we are in full-fledged production."
Toyota is not about how long production will last, and he said in a long period of time, warns that increased prices will reduce the competitiveness over time to complete the work.
Peter Tsoullavaris who has worked for Burnaston for 24 years and is now on the run of Unite in this puzzle saying they are about to worry again. "The time I've spent I've been aware that when I've walked this job I won't return."
According to the government spokesperson, "We have a reliable plan about future relations with the EU.

According to Trump's statement that he is not running a general representative, who risked Mueller's independence, has been the cause of a great deal of news in Washington over the past month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein meant that he would wear something that records a conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the defendant by amendment 25
Rosenstein's comments were made.
But on the last day he went to the White House, in the midst of a statement he would withdraw
Instead, the meeting together.
Trump said he "did not choose" to dismiss Royentein, but the meeting was delayed to judge a dispute in the Senate of the Commissioner hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom testified.
on Friday, Tump authorized a week's FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, which he has narrowly delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's media correspondent, Mrs. Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "The day when it is not used, or not this week, I saw that a re-up after a week all other things happened in a high court.
But we're going to see it and I always love to keep the press updated."
According to some scholars, Sanders did not run the White House line from 10 September.
It's like Chris Wallace asked why.
According to Sanders, the lack of comments was not due to the disruption of TV advertisers "great," although he said, "I won't agree with the fact that they're looking for."
He also suggested that he contact directly between Trump and the promotional press.
"The President did <0x51><0x26>A sessions and sessions rather than any previous president," he added without counting the evidence: "We look at those numbers."
According to reports that will happen, Sanders said, but "if the publisher has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States for questions more specifically, it's better than talking to me.
"We're trying to do it and you've seen him do a lot in the last few weeks and it'll replace the printing definition when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often takes questions when you leave the White House or participates in open sessions or combines conferences with progressive sentences.
Solo news conferences are a disaster.
a New York in the week the president probably showed why, making a free-heeling and occasionally unpredictable before meeting the press.

He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership for the season.
I want to play my country as a player.
I've got B-sides and I'm saying, "Ross has told the BBC Scotland Sports.
"I grew up watching Scotland in Henden too much with her as a child, and it's always something that protects me.
This is the time to come, even if I'm successful in the club's administration."
Ross's priorities as Sunderland's manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio

"I really believe that the power is better for me than to play.
It sounds like I did well, made a good life in it, and I enjoyed it high.
But playing can be difficult.
There is much more to be done for each week.
I have continued to do so according to the conditions of stress and labour pressure but the administration feels right.
I've always wanted to rule and now I'm doing that, feeling that I'm free to be in my pocket in my entire adult life."

Mr Park said the border control between North Korea and China and the higher rates paid by the mainstreamers.
Pyongyang did not make public views.
Most of the victims of the North are finally given to South Korean citizens.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
the majority of them fled in China, with the highest limit in North Korea and it is easy to cross beyond the Dilitized Zone (DMZ) region between the two Koreans.

According to Persian, he believed Kavanaugh's conviction that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as he indicated that he is being abused by Democrats.
"I think you're preparing those comments and how they follow the Clintons and Democrats," he said.

"I'm going to say this - if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or FBI, then he doesn't deserve to be a Supreme Court, but to be in court right now," Persian said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Persia added that as a democracy he was concerned about the Kavanaugh Act's condemnation or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative justice.
in his confirmation of imprisonment, Kavanaugh answered questions about whether he could change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
