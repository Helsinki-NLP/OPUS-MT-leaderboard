debris of Hurricane Rosa to bring heavy rain across the southwestern United States
as predicted, Hurricane Rosa continues to weaken as it passes over more static waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
but Hurricane Rosa, however, will bring flood rains across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States for the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa was a 85 mph, Type 1 hurricane, at 11 a.m. Eastern Hours on Sunday, and was seen 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
c. At this time, atmospheric pressure has begun to fuse over the Pacific Ocean and to the east towards the West Coast, with Hurricane Rosa approaching the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin pushing tropical moist hum to the north in the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday
then, a tropical humidity that begins to interact with the pressures of the nearest atmosphere will cause heavy rain to the west in the future.
inland areas, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden flooding, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
the high tropical humidity will cause rain levels to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in one location, specifically the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
c. is expected to be rain levels of 2 to 4 inches in the southwest, specifically most of Arizona.
the sudden flooding can occur due to conditions that continue to occur due to the high-speed tropical rain conditions.
will be too dangerous to go out into the desert on foot from the danger of raining in tropical rain.
so many of the rain can cause the shells to be large rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and scattered dust.
the adjacent atmosphere will bring heavy rainfall in some of the coastal areas of Southern California.
the total rainfall rates that exceed half an inch may occur, which can cause a small drop of mud and sliding roads.
this will be the first rainfall in the area in the rainy season.
some of the tropical rainy rains will begin to head to Arizona areas later on Sundays and Monday mornings, before further precipitation later on Mondays and Tuesdays.
the rainfall will spread in Four Horns on Tuesdays to Wednesdays.
the October may have a high temperature change throughout the United States with Arctic temperatures declining, but tropical areas will continue to have an average temperature.
sometimes this causes sudden changes of temperature in a short distance.
there is a good example of abrupt contrast in temperatures across the United States on Sunday.
there is approximately 20 degree temperature difference between the Town of Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
as for the next few days, the approaching summer heat will try to mix and spread again.

p. I'm standing here before you," a woman said.
<0x51>uote: "Do you think she tells the country the truth?
it was said to her, "The greater shall serve the less shall serve the lesser."
the Flake said that his admission had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was shut down, that he would have much to say in the committee case.
the broadcasting and cable networks were all brightening hours later, while the Court Committee was voting to promote Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a full vote.
but Flake said he could do so with the knowledge that the FBI could investigate claims against the electorate in the next week, which few Democrats have been arguing.
ben Flake was convinced to some extent by a conversation with his friend, the Democrat Senator. Chris Coons.
after a conversation with the Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
the Flake election was strong, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without investigation.
c. President Trump has filed investigations through the FBI on allegations against Kavanaugh.

societies Trump continued, "You see this horrendous, terrible group of Democrats, you see they do right now.
they have decided to take power in any possible way, you can see what is boredom, vice.
they don't care people who hurt, who offend us for power and control, what they want is power and control, we can't give them."

Uh, yeah, what it is.

the Leba Party is no longer a church living.
to resist free thought.
p. when the Momentum activists in the local party voted to remove me, it was not very strange.
after all, I am one in the Leba MPs line to be told that we are not required - all by saying our thoughts.
a member of the legislature Joan Ryan was treated similarly because he stood for his rebellion against the discrimination of the judiciary.
in my case, the proposal for removing me dismayed me by disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
about the importance of appropriate economic policy, about national security, about the issue of Europe, is that such issues are similar to what Jeremy differs from previous leaders.
a statement to the Leba conference in East Nottingham on Friday explained that "we want meetings to be live and effective."
c. over eight years as Local Lebanese MP, the GC Friday night meetings have been fully complementary.
unfortunately today, it did not look like many meetings and the political promise "solid, generous" has long been forgotten if, indeed, had begun.
as it has become increasingly evident that different views are not accepted in the Leba party and all views are considered well if they are only accepted by the party leadership.
this was about to begin shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as a fellow who I was thinking we share the same political attitude he began to expect me to change ideas completely and take positions that I would never agree with — whether it is about national security or one market in the European Union.
whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - what follows is an insult in social media and the effort to want me not to be elected, reject the politics of the centralist, and tell me that I should not be in the Leba party.
p. And it's not the situation that I've reviewed alone.
be sure, I know I'm more lucky than my other counterparts because the views directed to me are political.
I respect the skills and the statement of my colleagues who are faced with sexual or color insults every day but never give up.
one of the most frustrating factors in contemporary politics is how the levels of abuse are considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Leba party should develop a culture of tolerance.
the truth is that we are no longer church jumuishi and for every debate that tire "distrust" or change in the principles of selection, the party becomes the most narrower in the whole.
I've got a lot of advice over the last two years if I've been urged to settle, don't talk too much and that "I'll be right."
but I didn't enter politics to do so.
since I joined the Leba Party 32 years ago as a school student, due to the motivation to be ignored by the Thatcher government which left my full school class almost to fall, I have worked to fight for better public services for those who need it more—whether it is a regional councillor or government minister.
I have not hidden the form of my politics, including in the previous elections.
no one in Nottingham East could be confused about attitudes in policy and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
p. to those who brought forward the debate on Friday, all I'll say is that while the country is about to leave the European Union amalgamate Brexit, a step that will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to lose time and force to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Leba party.
but actually one message of mine is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is for citizens in my area, whether members of the Leba party or not: I am proud to serve them and promise that there is no amount of threats to be eliminated or politically proper will prevent me from considering what I believe is for the best interests of all of you.

ayr 38 - 1<0x37> Melrose: Ayr's uncredited team still takes the first place on the table
c. two attempts in the final may have changed to some extent the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr qualified to win in this highly anticipated thriller match of the Tennant League.
they now lead the table, the only team that has not been defeated.
at last, it was their best defense , as well as the use of their positions, which helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had the right to satisfaction.
p. "We have been tested in our games so far, and yet we have not failed, so I must be happy," he said.
Melrose's son Robyn Christie said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they used their best chances to settle down."
the Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, tied by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but the yellow card to Scottish team player Rory Hughes, released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to use the opportunity to have more players and Jason Baggot found a closed attempt that was not tied.
alo Climo added Ayr's leadership to the penalti, just before the rest of the time, scored and then completed the attempt alone and made the score 1<0x37><0xE2><0x80><0x93>5 for Ayr during the break.
but Melrose started well in the second half with Patrick Anderson's attempt, tied by Baggot, reducing the lead by five points.
then the game was then suspended for a while after a dangerous injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was removed from being carried by the game when re-introduced, Ayr added his leadership to the Stafford McDowall experiment, closed by Climo.
cum Ayr Blair Macpherson's captain was then given a yellow card over and over again, Melrose used the chance to have one more player and tied up with Bruce Colvine's attempt, at the end of the period with severe pressure.
the home team then took control again, however, while Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card by abusing Climo without a ball and from the penalti line outside, MacPherson scored due to a severe attack from Ayr.
alo Climo closed, how he was doing after the game began again, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's scarf and mocked Gregor Henry and tied the fifth attempt for the home team.

'Bahari is ours': Bolivia that has no port hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
in which the crew patrols at sea headquarters in La Paz.
the public buildings have set up a blue flag like the sea.
the sea stations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon have been written as saying: "The sea is for us right.
revival is a duty."
cite in Bolivia without port, the memory of the coastal belt that lost it to Chile in the 19th century's resource crisis is still clear - just like a desire to travel again in the Pacific Ocean.
p. this hope is perhaps now the highest for many years, with Bolivia waiting for an international justice court ruling on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
c. "Bolivia has a speed, a spirit of unity and tranquility and really has expectations of a positive attitude effectively," said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat.
many of Bolivian citizens will look at the decision of ICJ on a large screen across the country, claiming that the court in The Hague will make a decision accepting Bolivia's claims - after decades of appropriate conversation - Chile would be forced to discuss the move to give Bolivia a way to the sea.
evo Morales, Bolivia's natural president <0xE2><0x80><0x93> who faces a sharp confrontation in the next year's re-election <0xE2><0x80><0x93> also has much to do with Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he swore in late August.
but other critics believe there is little possibility that the court will make a decision that suits Bolivia - and that there will be very little changes even if it decides.
the Dutch-based corporation has no authority to disprove Chile territory to other countries, and has said that it cannot detect the outcome of the expected discussion.
criteria the decision of the ICJ will be made only six months after the final debate suggesting that the case "is not a joke," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
if not far from promoting Bolivia's hopes, four years ago could have brought it back.
p. "The issue of sea access is exploited by the current Bolivia administration," said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate .
said Morales's political words have ended Chile's remaining good intentions, he said.
about Bolivia and Chile at some point will continue the conversation, but it will be very difficult to make negotiations after this.
the two countries have not exchanged diplomats since 19<0x36>2.
former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9> , Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were too fast.
p. Monday it will give Bolivia a "stunning opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of varying from mutual benefit," he said.
circa Calzadilla also denied that Morales <0xE2><0x80><0x93> still one of the most popular presidents in the South United States <0xE2><0x80><0x93> was using sea issue as a political stream.
a "Bolivia will never give up on her right to reach the Pacific Ocean," he added.
to say "The decision is a chance to realize that we need to go ahead."
North Korea says the removal of nuclear weapons will not be possible unless it is believed by the United States
the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation will never get rid of his nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
au Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
he said he called on the United States to follow the promise he made during a meeting in Singapore between the opposition leaders.
cite his comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to re-establish the nuclear diploma which had been unsuccessful for over three months after the Singapore conference with North Korean president Kim Jong Un.
ai Ri says it is a "small dream" that to promote U.S. restrictions and opposition to a report that ends the Korean War will ever make the North weak.
ben Washington's fear of accepting information without Pyongyang first making important measures to remove weapons.
is Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump both want a second meeting.
but there is a big doubt that Pyongyang is considering the elimination process that the country considers as the only way to ensure its safety.

if you want to add a collection of your hats or completely prevent sunshine then you'll cut the solution.
in which experts Valentino and Thom Browne launched very large head-to-head equipment in their collection SS19 in stage shows that you are surprised by design at the Fashion Week in Paris.
bench caps that are difficult to create have attracted many on Instagram in this summer and these designers have given these beautiful hats to be used on the fashion platform.
the impressive Valentine's bell was of a tanguous hat set of broad feather-like edges that covered the heads of the model.
some other large materials include tikitimatum, witch hat and even pineapple - but they are not designed to give your head warm.
the Thom Browne also exposed the strange provinces <0xE2><0x80><0x93> at the close of Halloween's time.
they're a lot of coloured brackets with stitched lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter than fashion skills
one design was similar to a skyuba squirrel with a spoon and glasses, while others resembled a melted ice cream coil.
be if you go on with a large fashion statement - you're lucky.
about the fashion spectators predict that big bonnets can be on their way to the elegant stores around you.
the super caps offer innovation in 'La Bomba', a babbling hat with the edges of the width of the two lights and lead everyone to wear it from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.

cite John Edward: linguistic knowledge is essential for international citizens
the Scottish independent schools continue to maintain a record of professional skills and this has continued in 2018 with another set of best test scores, which are reinforced by personal and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
in conjunction with an increase of over 30,000 students in Uskoti, these schools, represented by the Council of Independent Schools in Uskoti (regular SCIS), strive to provide a better service level for students and parents.
c. independent schools aim to provide their students with more education and higher education, the professions they choose and their position as international citizens.
as the education sector that can create and implement a special school curriculum, we see modern languages continuing to become popular with a preferred school lesson.
citadel Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in the language you understand, that goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his native language, he goes to his heart."
such as this is an important reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build relationships with people from other countries.
from the recent results of this year's test, we can see that languages guide the league table with high scores in independent schools.
a total of <0x36>8<0x25> of foreign-language learners found the top A.
data collected from <0x37>4 SCIS schools, indicated that <0x37>2<0x25> of students found the top A in Mandarin and <0x37>2<0x25> for German learners, <0x36>9<0x25> for those who learn French and <0x36>3<0x25> for Spanish learners also found A.
this shows that independent schools in Scots support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will need in their future.
a language now, as a chosen subject, is taken to the same level as STEM classes (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school courses and elsewhere.
a study by the British Commission on Accountability and Skills in 2014 found that one of the reasons employers said they found when they had the challenge of filling jobs, 1<0x37><0x25> was associated with the lack of linguistic knowledge .
so much more and more, linguistic knowledge becomes necessary to provide young people with their future professions.
as many job opportunities if needed language, this knowledge is important in the world of globalization.
criteria no matter what profession one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will find more realistic space in the future to have knowledge of life like this.
to be able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries you will place a multilingual speaker ahead in competition.
c. according to YouGov's study of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, <0x37>5<0x25> were unable to speak a foreign language well to promote the French language which is the only language spoken by a percentage of double figures, 15 percent.
this is why investing in language training is now important for current children.
being multilingual, specifically those of developing countries, will give children a good chance to get meaningful jobs.
in Uskoti, each school will have a different language that teaches.
some schools will consider more modern languages, where others will teach languages that seem to be most important for Britain in the future until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
c. Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be several languages of choice in independent schools, as well as instructional experts in this field.
c.Scotti's independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will provide children and give them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of their future professions.
if it cannot be challenged that at this time, in the state of international trade, that languages remain very important in the future of the country, thus this should be reflected in education.
in fact, modern languages should be taken into account as "the international knowledge of communication."
as well as independent schools will continue to give this option, the distinction and quality of the Scots youth.
I'm not going to be a bad guy.

Donald Trump will start a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
will be the first of five meetings that are scheduled to take place next week, including standing in areas where he has many supporters including Tennessee and Mississippi.
p.g. while the vote to confirm whether it is still suspended about who appointed him to fill the position of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create electoral support as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress while votes will be held in November.

Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 1 p.m. Eastern Hours tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
you can watch the West Virginia Trump conference online via a live stream on YouTube.
there is a possibility that Trump will talk about the case to take place this week about Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh, which has brought much concern about sexual abuse charges that led to the temporarily suspension of Senate evidence vote for a week while the FBI is investigating.
but the goal of this congressional congress is to beat the debe candidates for the Republicans in the November election to gain more popularity.

2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team shows a fight and maintain hope leading to a one-man game on Sunday
after three points in one direction, a game of two players for two Saturday afternoons may be a thrill that the Ryder Cup needs
a simultaneous rhythm is a fully designed concept of games but in which players believe the truth and even more in competitions such as
will they then say where is the speed going now?
the "They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we take that as a little speed I think," said Jordan Spieth after finishing the day.
Europe has a better chance, of course, four points ahead and four marks, with a better one.
the Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have extra strength and have a lot to encourage, also focusing on Spieth's play by Justin Thomas who played together all day and each is proud of three out of four points.
the Spieth has been dangerous from the beginning of the game to the pit of the game and leads as a role model.
the high frequency of the celebration noise increased as his turn progressed, importing the ball after hitting the ball towards the hole and balancing when he and Thomas were down with two points after two turns.
his ball beat to the hole won a match of 15 holes and you got a lot of noise to celebrate, which shows you believe that the American team is still not heartbroken.
a "You really have to be actively active and focusing on your own match," Spieth said.
now that's what these players have just left to do now.
the 18 holes are waiting for them to show that.
the only players that have more marks than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unexplained story of the Ryder Cup.
the stunning European jersey has four out of four points and they have currently not made any mistakes.
the "Moliwood" is the only pair that did not beat the ball more frequently on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided hitting the ball more frequently on Saturday mornings, Friday mornings and in the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
the quality, and how their strength seems to increase between them and the crowd proves to be that the players will give the highest competition on Sunday and there are probably no other famous players who can win for Europe when the day ends in Le Golf National if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
if they all do at the same time in different holes.
is very early to discuss victory in Europe, however.
bubba Watson and Webb Simpson faced Sergio Garcia, morning hero in a two-game game, when he formed a pair with Alex Noren.
the extra beat and two more balls in the nine opening pits placed the Spaniard and Swiss in a situation that was difficult from.
on Sunday, however, no one can crack you in situations that you will get in.
play two vs. two is very excited to look closely because of the interaction between the pair, the advice they offer, the advice they don't give and how the strategy can change at once.
Europe has done better as a team so far and took a big lead towards the final day but this pairing period has also shown that the U.S. team has a counter-attack that some, especially those in the United States, were skeptical.
Europe lead 10<0xE2><0x80><0x93><0x36> in the Ryder Cup on the last day
Europe would play a good place in the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning in a pair match with four balls by 10<0xE2><0x80><0x93><0x36> against the United States.
the Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game with two victories against Tiger Woods who appeared to be overwhelmed and brought their score total to the present on Le Golf National to four points.
the European team of Thomas Bjorn, struggling to pray with the shell that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, led the US that appeared to be overwhelmed in a game of four balls in the morning, winning a series 3<0xE2><0x80><0x93>1.
the U.S. issued further opposition in pair matches against the pair and won two matches, but were unable to eliminate deficit.
the Jim Furyk team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to pray with the shell.
v. Fleetwood is the first new player in Europe to win four consecutive scores when he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after the exciting weekend ended they became only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
after defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a match of four balls they worked well together and defeated Wood and American Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
son Woods, who was back in both matches on Saturday, showed periods of good play but now lost 19 out of 29 in four balls and seven consecutive matches.
- Justin Rose, who rested for a match of four balls in the morning, returned to team up with Henrik Stenson in a pair match and defeated 2 and 1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - listed in the first and third place in the world.
Europe found nothing though the day was good, with an impressive wind in the southwest of Paris.
the three-time main shell winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the pattern for Americans by two points on Saturday.
they scored 2 and 1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a match of four balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in a pair game after losing two opening holes.
is only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup where the team has managed from behind by four points to go in one-man game, though Furyk team only needs to leave the uniform to pray with the shell.
after being in a second position for two days, however, the struggle to win on Sunday seems to be far away from them.
North Korea says 'it is impossible' will remove weapons without believing that others will do what they should.
the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was further weakening belief in the United States and no way the country could remove its nuclear weapons without others doing what they should under such circumstances.
cite Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly annually that North Korea had taken "good intentions measures" last year, such as suspending nuclear tests and missiles, breaking the nuclear test station and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
c. "Without any faith from the United States there will be no faith in our national security in such a situation and there is no way we will remove our weapons first without others to do what they should."
circa While Ri reiterated North Korea's complaints regarding Washington's opposition to the "step" strategy by removing nuclear weapons where North Korea would get a bribe taking a small step, its report seemed important as it did not reject the nuclear disarmament step in terms of how Pyongyang has done it in the past.
ai Ri referred to a joint report issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the current U.S. President and North Korean leader Singapore on June 12, while Kim promised to work to "severe nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
the North Korea has been looking for an official solution to the Korean war of 1950<0xE2><0x80><0x93>53, but the United States says Pyongyang must remove its nuclear weapons first.
the Washington has also rejected a call in order to put an end to international sanctions against North Korea.
the "U.S. insists" first the removal of nuclear weapons" and increases the level of pressure using obstacles to achieve their goal by means of coercing and even opposing the "last declaration of war," Ri said.
c. "The view that obstacles can weaken is an impossible dream from people who ignore us.
but the problem is that the pervasive obstacles continue to develop disbelief.
ci "Ri did not mention plans for the second meeting between Kim and Trump who the U.S. leader was involved in the United Nations earlier this week.
the minister instead illuminated three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If a partner in this issue of nuclear distancing would be in South Korea and not in the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula would not be in this state."
c.i., Ri's speech was somewhat different from last year, however, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the move to target the U.S. mainland and North Korean rockets would be inevitable after "Mr. President Evil" Trump referred to Kim as a "man rocket man" who aimed to carry out the killings.
c. this year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "extremely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking the steps to remove the weapons, but said a major task should still be carried out and the restrictions should be taken down until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
cite on Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a specific time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia say that the United Nations Security Council should charge Pyongyang for the steps it took.
circa However, the U.S. Secretary of State told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue in depth and inevitably until we find complete, final and can be confirmed nuclear weapons."
a jointly, the Security Council has increased sanctions against North Korea since 200<0x36> in an effort to remove funds for nuclear programs and Pyongyang missiles.
cum Pompeo met Ri after the UN General Assembly later said that he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his final trip was not well.
he left Pyongyang in July saying that progress has taken place, but only within several hours North Korea accused him of giving "assessment as a criminal."
the North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy the missile base as well as the nuclear weapons station if the United States takes "related measures."
said that Kim had told him that the "related measures" he wanted were a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and aimed to strengthen relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught a lesson in getting enough rest.
a new lesson at Harvard University this year requires all undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to fight the culture of gentlemanship and read for 'all night' with coffee assistance.
about ‘The expert discovered students at the university number one in the world are ignorant about the basic issue of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created the subject, which he believes to be the first type in the United States.
.He was invited to form a lesson after giving a speech about how insufficient sleep affects training.
'At the end of the speech, one girl came to me and said, 'Why are I just told these things now, in my last year?'
he said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
the lesson, which is first introduced this year, describes the basics of how good sleep style helps in professional and sports activities and also improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatrist at the Harvard School of Medicine and managing director of university health care, said that the university decided to start the subject after finding out that students had fallen asleep in the week.
the hour-long lesson involves a series of cooperative activities.
in one section there is a bedroom picture, where students press for coffee, curtains, shoes and books and are described about the effects of coffee and light and how sports activities are affected by sleeplessness and the importance of sleep schedule.
in other places, participants are told how long sleeplessness can increase the risk of cardiovascular shock, stroke, malnutrition and cancer.
the academy and iconic map share, then encourages participants to tell about their daily routine.
p. 'We know this lesson won't change student behavior immediately.
but we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the harm to health when you smoke, 'Professor Czeisler added.
the culture of pride in the 'smoking' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and pressure for rising students means insomnia was an ongoing problem.
to ensure that you get enough sleep, well quality, you should be a student's 'secret weapon' to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the mind in a state of dissatisfaction and make you hungry all the time.
au Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who studies physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create a subject, having participated in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
he said that the lesson opened his eyes and gave him the one to create a college college's entire lesson.
the next step, he sends, is to ask all graduate students to make a corresponding lesson before joining a highly competitive institution.
p.a Professor Czeisler suggested that students should consider setting a bedtime bell as well as a wake-time bell and familiar with the effects of 'blue light' given by electric screens and LED lamp, which can damage the brain's clock and cause sleep disorders.

the Rangers were again defeated in another foreign game when Dolly Menga's suspension was stolen from Steven Gerrard's seemingly overwhelmed team and lost 1<0xE2><0x80><0x93>0 in Livingston.
the Ibrox team was aiming to win the first tournament since a 4<0xE2><0x80><0x93>1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but the Gary Holt team caused Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager and left his team eight points behind the leaders of the Ladbrokes League, Hearts.
the Menga scored seven minutes before the rest and the Rangers never seemed to balance.
circular while Rangers now go down to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and they are just behind Hibernian with the distinction of the logs.
circular and there may be more problems for Rangers after flag holder Calum Spence needs treatment after head injury to something that was fired from Rangers supporters.
son Gerrard made eight changes to the team that tied Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
p<0xC3><0xAD> Holt, on the other hand, used all 11 players who got uniform against Hearts last week and will be happy with how well prepared his team faced their opponents all the time.
the Rangers dominated the ball more but Livingston used their positions well when they got the ball.
they were to close only the second minute when the first Menga ball gave Scott Pittman a chance to go to Allan McGregor gate but the organ threw the ball out.
a penalty shoot from Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his partner in defence Alan Lithgow was able to beat just outside the goal.
the Rangers took control but their game was seen not only with faith but not self-confidence when they approached the closing area.
au Alfredo Morelos felt that he was supposed to get a penalti in the 15th minute after being hit by Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson said the game would continue even after the Colombian claim.
the Rangers were able to hit two caps in the goal during the first half but former Ibrox gate defender Liam Kelly would not be seriously challenged by the head ball from Lassana Coulibaly and a weak clamp from Ovie Ejaria.
as when Livi's goal in the 34th minute was not due to the normal game, no one can refuse to qualify for the win.
again the Rangers failed to deal with the penalty ball from the Jacobs.
the Scott Arfield didn't do anything when Declan Gallagher coached him ball Scott Robinson, who was strong and kicked the ball towards the touching and closing Menga.
circular Gerrard made a decision during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the move was about to get the result when the organ presented him with Morelos ball but Kelly ran away from his part and blocked the ball.
but Livingston continued to disrupt visitors and make them play the way they want, with Lithgow and Halkett hitting the ball long after.
the Holt team could add a goal in the last minutes but McGregor was strong and prevented Jacobs before Lithgow kicking the ball out with the head.
the Rangers' reserve player Glenn Middleton had other penalti demands in the last minutes when they faced Jacobs but again referee Thomson ignored the request off.

a technique involves removing immunity cells from the patient, replacing them in the laboratory
then they can 'see' a protein that is popular in most cancers and then re-introduced.
the test vaccine shows positive results in patients with various cancers.
a woman who was treated with vaccination, which teaches the immune system to identify a bad cell, was able to treat her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
the pathway involves removing protective cells from the patient, replacing them in laboratory so that they can "see" the common protein for most HER2 cancers, and then re-entering the cells.

citadel Maxine Waters denied that her employee exposed the data of the GOP senators, reprimanded the 'dangerous lies' and 'controversial theories'
United States Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that his employee published a personal description of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
the Democratic Party's MP from Los Angeles said that the allegations were being spread by analysts and websites of "significant right-wing supporters".
be "a lie, lie, and more meaningless lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
the comments made are alleged to include home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
the comment appeared online Thursday, published by an anonymous on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel hearings of sexual abuse charges against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
the disclosure occurred a few days after the senators accused Kavanaugh.
conservative areas such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address which recognizes the source of publications was associated with the Waters office and commented by Waters employee, Hill reported.
p. this underlying claim is entirely false and misleading," Waters continued.
c. "My employee - whose identity, personal details, and safety have been influenced by these allegations of fraud and lies - was never involved and exposed to these comments.
such unfounded claims are completely false and completely misleading."

c. "This suggests that he has no control of the right feelings to become a Congressional Commissioner.
when one is used for something he does not act, he should not be angry.

the Johnny English Strikes film Analysis Again - a joke in the Rowan Atkinson spy smuggling
p.a. it is common to look at Brexit's effects in any new film that leans to England but this does not apply to the rehearsal of another comedy-war film for Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 to Johnny English Reborn.
is it? would the comic of a personal joke in the topic of how we're ugly would be a new opportunity abroad?
at any rate, Johnny English's eye-catching, the moving face has a license to make mistakes again in a way re-entered for a second time—the name shows his most sign that he has been designed with broad humor for non-English people.
he is actually an investigator who in spite of strange demands for an interesting humour shows Clouseau's qualities, the qualities of Mr Bean and the person who contributed one of the scene music to the Chariots of Fire at the Olympic opening ceremony in London 2012.
p.i. he was originally involved as a traveller and an amazing international figure Atkinson was at one point involved in Barclaycard TV's now forgotten broadcasts, leaving many as uninterested.
there is one or two things in this recent JE film.
of the estuary I liked to see Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a jade suit of weapons and flattened symptoms changing for a while on his hat.
the Atkinson's talent in physical humor was reflected here, but the humor appears to be low and unnecessarily, humor, humor sans because "great" films such as 00<0x37> and Mission Impossible include humor as part of it.
the humor appears to be whether you are targeting children and not adults and wrestling with me Johnny English's unique trips are not fantasy and they don't have to focus on how Akinson's silent film humor as a character Bean.
the annual theory is now that Britain is in great trouble.
the introvert has been able to enter a secret network of British web sites and expose the identity of all British investigators outside work and surprise the detective at work <0xE2><0x80><0x93> unfortunately it was a very easy task for Kevin Eldon.
c. in his final time as a proud prince and faced with much opposition and already deeply affected in political fame: Emma Thompson does very well for her character corresponding to Teresa May but the story does not help him to show these qualities.
c. her security advisers to let her know that because the identity of every detective has been exposed, she must use a retired person.
p.n. that means using Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a school teacher in a prestigious school, but teaches informal training about how to be a secret spy: some good humor there, while English teaches spying similar to the School of Rock film.
bean English is reverted to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and joined by his former partner Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
bough now a married man, is associated with the manor of the fleet, a thrilling position where Vicki Pepperdine has not been involved.
so the characters corresponding to Batman and Robin but by destroying things in the Secret Kingdom Service are returning to work and in line with Olga Kurylenko acting as Ophelia Bulletova.
at the same time, the prime minister seems to be more involved in the spying of a fascist boy who claims to be able to solve all of the technology problems in the United Kingdom: Jason Volta, simulated by Jake Lacy.
the English and Bough begin their most enjoyable journey : they pretend hotel attendants, they fire in a French luxury restaurant; they begin violence and enter without permission in Volta's luxury boat; and English causes a yawn as they try to use the tools of the Improved Reality to learn it.
all the rest has undoubtedly been removed for the final sequence, but regardless of the stress and turbulence that is traumatized, there are so many characteristics of children's programming in the film hio.
to be well-deserved.
p.a. and just as it does other Johnny English films I had to re-write: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
the Leba Party denies that it has a plan for the British to work four days but was paid for five days.

but how has the World Citizens Festival been successful remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
is the idea of bringing people to free concert tickets is a real way to persuade people to push action, or just another case of what is known as "only online activism" - people feel like they bring a real difference by signing an online request or sending tweets?
from 2011, the World Citizens Festival says that it has over 19 million "acts" from its supporters to different objectives.
cite it says that these actions have pushed world leaders to declare the commitments and policies equivalent to <0x24>3<0x37> billion that will change the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.

United States can use the Navy to "stop" Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
the Washington can be "if necessary" to use its Navals to prevent Russian energy from being sold, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has said, as described by Washington Examiner.
aku Zinke said that Russia's participation in Syria - especially, where it works at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to investigate new energy markets.
c. "I believe the reason for them that the Middle East is looking for energy markets as they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe," reportedly said.

such reports arrive at a time when the Trump administration has been on a mission to increase its natural gas sales to Europe and take over Russia, which has become a very cheap choice for European users.
because of this, Trump administration leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project of "Nord Stream 2," which according to Trump, made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly asserted that the Nord Stream 2 billion pipeline of 11 billion, which aims to double the current capacity of 110 billion volumes, is only an economic project.
the kremlin says that much of Washington's opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
c. "I believe we agree that energy is not good enough to be a tool for pressure and that users should be able to choose sellers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting U.S. Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
the U.S. stance has been deployed by Germany, which has confirmed his commitment to the project.
the German organization leading in the sector, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called for the United States to abstain from the EU's energy policy and two-state treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
c. "I have a major problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chansela Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

c. U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'abusement' through 'propaganda advertisements'
a week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper that illuminated the common benefits of the U.S. and Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. journalists to spread propaganda.

Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to intervene in the U.S. elections shows what U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's fast-paced campaigns to push China.

c. "In distributing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a method that has been sponsored by the United States of free views and information by putting the advertisements paid on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
c. "In comparison, in local newspaper sections in Beijing, you will find very few voices giving resistance and you will not be able to see the real situation and the different views that the Chinese people may have in relation to the troubled economic goals of China, considering that the media is being closely controlled by the Communist Party."
he added that "one of China's most popular newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what magazine he did.

American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he will play his 4<0x37>th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his game so that he won't reach the point unhappy.
quarterback Mickelson, playing in a two-game event per year and setting a 12-game play record, was placed on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for four balls and a pair game.
rather than being in the depth of the event, as he had often been in the United States, this five-time winner of the main shell sliced his day between being a fan and practicing the game in hopes of modifying his problem.
never a leader even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old player is not the right choice for a game in the Le Golf National field, whose bad ball is punished occasionally.
p.a. if the field is not enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces British champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined new player Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches this week.
be if Americans, who are four points behind when starting a 12-man match, have a strong opposition, Mickelson's match can prove to be absolutely important.
au Furyk showed courage in his man, not that he could say more.
circularly understood the role he had today, the church and embraces and assures me that he will be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
he says: "He is very bold in his power.
he is a celebrity and has made a significant contribution to these teams in the past and this week.
or perhaps I didn't see him playing two matches.
when I expected to play more, but that's what happened and that's the way we thought we should take into consideration.
he wants to be out there playing, just like anyone else."
Mikeckelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most matches in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
it could be his final in playing the Ryder Cup which has never been identical to the quality of his personal record.
rookie Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven uniforms, although Furyk said his presence brought some benefit to the team.

he has more contribution than just playing."

to say "You keep reminding me that we had a great leadership in Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but very closely," said Bjorn, having been photographed, after watching Class of 2018 winning 5<0xE2><0x80><0x93>3 Friday and yesterday leading 10<0xE2><0x80><0x93><0x36> at Leal Golf Naf.
p. so history refers to me and everyone on the team that the game has not yet ended.
you're going to be more aggressive there tomorrow.
go there and make sure you are doing the things you should do.
the game ends until the score is scored.
that's what we are aiming and is trying to win this shell and that's what we are aiming.
I've said this all the time, I'm focusing on 12 players who are in our team, but we know well the quality of the opposing team - the best players in the world.
circa "Happy by how his players did in a hard field, Bjorn added: "I would not have hoped more than these in this.
tomorrow is a very different day.
tomorrow is a personal activity that you will decide and this is a different thing.
if it is best to be out there and partner when things are interesting, but when you are out there alone, then you are fully tested with all your abilities as a golfer.
that is the message you need to explain to the players, it's acting to your best quality tomorrow.
now, you leave your partner should go and act better on his own, too.
std "In contrast to Bjorn, team captain Jim Furyk will send his players to the best of their personal performances compared to when they played as associates, with the exception of Jordan and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
au Furyk himself was involved in the popular games on the last day, having become part of the winning team in Brookline before finishing in defeat when Europe got "Medina's Miracle."
p. "I remember every word," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, brought his players together to the final day.
ru "We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get a good start as in Brookline, as you've seen in Medina.
when the speed goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.
that we organized our players effectively and kept people in a way that we felt preferable, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
the Thomas has been given a job of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in a high-profile match, by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter other teammates in the top half of the list.
criteria "I went with this group in this order because I think it's reflecting all the trip," said Bjorn for his choice of players in a personal game.
a new German warship is again being replenished
the newest German Navy ship was planned to be launched in 2014 to replace the old ships used in the Cold War, but will not be until at least next year due to poor systems and increased costs, the media reported.
the launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the leading ship between the new type ship Baden-Wuertttemberg, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine quoted a military spokesman.
this ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but future delivery issues affected the fate of this large project.

be known to include the energies of power, a row of propellers and planes and decorative missiles and ships as well as secret technologies, such as the reduced radar, infrared signals and of acoustics.
while other important components include organizations after a long time - it is possible to send the new ships for two years away from home.
in that case, the ongoing delay means that the high-speed warships—which are said to allow Germany to target abroad—they will already have been out of use, however, and when they become obsolete, he explained Die Zeit.
the F125 became famous last year, when the German Navy refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss in Hamburg.
this was the first time the Navy returned the ship to shipbuilders after the delivery.
not much is known about the reasons for rehabilitation, but the German media referred to several reasons for the "essential software and construction defects" that caused ships to miss the need in case of being sent to war.
deficit in the program was important because the Baden-Wuertttemberg ship will be operated by only 120 crew members of the crew on the former Bremen fleet.
as well, it also happened that the ship has an extra weight or blog is reducing its activity and limiting the Naval capabilities to improve the future.
the ship's "Rheinland-Pfalz" of <0x37>,000 tons is believed to be weighing twice compared to the similar ships used by the Germans in the Second Great War.
in addition to the faulty hull, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - is also a major issue.
ceilo reportedly reached 3.1 billion yuro (<0x24>3.<0x36> billion <0xE2><0x80><0x93> from the initial cost of 2.2 billion yuro.
the problems facing a new ship becomes particularly important due to the warning being the ability of German arsenal has dropped.
the earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that Navalism actually "is going to miss ships capable of being sent to war."
the official said that the issue had been neglected for a long time, because old ships were removed but no alternative ships were issued.
p.a complained that none of the Baden-Wuertttemberg type ships would be used by the Navy.

c. foreign buyers will be paid a high stamp tribute if they buy property in England - and additional funds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May has announced today.
the action will be seen as an attempt to balance the success that Jeremy Corbyn has found to attract young voters with the promise of providing affordable housing and targeting those with high income.
the increase in stamp tribute will be charged to individuals and businesses that do not pay their tribute in the UK, with additional funds being used to improve the government's plan to combat residential status for homeless people.
such additional payments - which include the current stamp tribute, including high rates set two years ago in second-houses and rental houses - may be up to three percent.

a new policy comes a week after Boris Johnson asked for a cut in the stamp tribute to help younger people buy their first home.

as well he also wants to give councillors more authority than to build a new house.
Mrs. May said: "Years yesterday I wanted to volunteer to restore the dream of England - that life should be better for every new generation.
that means changing our damaged residential sector.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a new life.
in fact, however, it cannot be fair that it is easy for people who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes at the same price as UK labor workers.
to so many people the dream of housing ownership has been too far away and there is a lot of possibility to be homeless."

p. hundreds of immigration children evacuated in Syria to Tent Camp in the Texas border
the number of children immigrated immigrants has increased even though the number of passers-by has not changed, because strong politics and policies issued by the Trump administration have made it difficult to keep children to donors.
philanthropistically, many donors have become unregistered immigrants and are afraid to risk their ability to pray in the country by promoting child demand.
the risk factor increased in June, when the country's authority announced that possible beneficiaries and other household adults would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared by immigration authority.
p.g. last week, Mathew Albence, senior official of Immigration and Customization, witnessed before Congress that the organization had arrested a number of people who had asked to fund children on their own.
the agency later confirmed that <0x37>0<0x25> of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
c. "About 80<0x25> of people who are philanthropists or family members are here in the illegal country and most of them are criminal aliens.
. so we keep track of those people," Mr. Albence said.
at the faster cutting stage, the leaders introduced new laws that would require some of them to be presented to the court within a month after the arrest, rather than <0x36>0 days, which was customary before, according to residential staff.
many will be presented through a meeting phone through a video, rather than a person to exist, to request their case legally to the immigration judge.
if they are considered to be in need of help, they will quickly be brought back.
c. how the child remains in detention for a long time is the more likely to be scared and worried or frustrated, which can lead to violent feelings or escape attempts, according to charcoal workers and reports that have emerged from the system several months ago.
the lawyers said these issues are rising in large stations such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has a poor condition are ignored, due to its magnitude.
they added that moving children to a tent city without giving enough time to provide them emotionally or intimacy with friends the last time can increase being what many already pass through.
Syria tells 'the so-called forces' of the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately
as addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, though it is now eight years of war in the country.
ai Moualem, who is also serving as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are in Syria illegally, under the pretext of counter-terrorism and "it will be handled properly."
that "they should leave immediately and without any obligation," he told the meeting.
moualem asserted that "a war against terrorism was almost complete" in Syria, where more than 3<0x36>0,000 people have died since 2011, and more millions have been deported.
said Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred war until we save all Syria" from all terrorist groups and "any foreign power."
the "UN has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, especially for training and counseling Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a country of war.
about in the case of refugees, Moualem said conditions were good for them to return and blamed the "western states" for "expanding false fear" which has caused refugees to stay away.

the United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no construction aid for Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a reservation of the bamboo in the last Idlib rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to advance with political dialogue.
the Russian-Turkish agreement has blocked the attacks of Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, where three million people live.
cite Moualem however maintained that the agreement had a "open time" and expressed hope that the military action will help militias including fighters from Nusra Front associated with Al-<0x51>aeda, who "will be completed."

about country prosecutors seeking a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
c. New York state prosecutors are seeking death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused of terrorist attacks in New York City that killed eight people - rare penalties that have not been carried out in the state for country crime since 1953.
saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental car to make an attack on the bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists along its way in October.
c. in order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors should prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious physical injuries, according to a report of intent to seek the death penalty, issued in the Southern District of New York.
all of these offenses carry the possibility of a death sentence, according to a court document.
a week after the attack, a panel of country judges ruled 22 charges for Saipov which included eight murder charges with the help of fraud, usually used by country prosecutors in criminal cases organized by violent charges and traffic damages.
the attacks needed to "plann and prepare well," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's action as "incriminating, cruel and misleading."
sayfurlo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, destruction, and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Lauren Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pacnu's
the five victims were tourists from Argentina.
had been ten years since the Southern District of New York implemented death penalty charges.
the accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
the last time the death penalty was executed in the New York state case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the husband and wife who were sentenced to death after being found guilty of plotting to make a butterfly for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
the Rosenberg two were killed in death by being placed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed the lack of regrets day and months after the attack, according to court documents.
he told the investigators that he felt well about what he did, police said.
Sanipov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attacks after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
ai also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
he has denied 22 criminal charges.
circa David Patton, one of the country's public defenders representing Saipov, said that they are "broken" by the prosecution decision.
p. "We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea for life in prison without the possibility of release will only increase it from such incidents to all those involved," Patton said.
the Saipov representative team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.

acquisition of Brett Kavanaugh's flexibility as FBI begins investigation
c. "I thought, if we could get something like what he asked for - a finite test of time, the height of magnitude - perhaps we could bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling" due to the complexity of the abolition.
or why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters of the Republicans not want the FBI to investigate?
is their reluctance from time.
a representative election takes place only five weeks from now, on November <0x36> - if, as expected, the Republicans are severely defeated, then they will be too weak in their efforts to place a person who wants to be elected to the top court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling the Senators, convincing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
is what will happen after the FBI issued its report?
will be voting in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats work.
is still unknown if Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will enable Mike Pence, vice president, to break the uniform and prove him to the Supreme Court.
the number of North Korean refugees 'down' under Kim
the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un gained power seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer said.
au park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's coalition ministry, said there were 1,12<0x37> refugees last year <0xE2><0x80><0x93> compared to 2,<0x37>0<0x36> in 2011.
p. Mr. Park said the highest control in the border between North Korea and China and the highest fine rates imposed on marketing businesses were the main reasons.
pyongyang has not made public comments.
the majority of refugees from the North are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
many escape through China, which has a much longer border with North Korea and is easier to cross than an area with most soldiers (remark DMZ) in the middle of the two countries of Korea.
China considers refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often return them to force.
is the connections between the North and the South - which are actually still in the war - have changed considerably in recent months.
the earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for a discussion that took into account the discussion of a standing nuclear disarmament.
the incident came after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on broad terms to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
but on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for lack of development ever since.
c. "With no faith in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under the circumstances, there is no way we will remove nuclear weapons as the first," said Mr Ri in a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.

salo Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
c. "I thought that if it were a woman she had done that way, they would say 'he can't control himself,'" Pelosi said of his response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh absolutely denied allegations that he abused Dr Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
c. at the time of his opening report, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost to scream and breathe talking about his family and years in high school.
citadel also denounced the Democrats on the committee, citing charges against him to be of "infamous and scheduled to destroy his reputation" organized by angry Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 201<0x36> presidential election.
pulosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he is incapable of serving in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he is discriminated against the Democrats.
p. "I think he's getting rid of the words and how he's accused the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi did not refuse when asked if he tried to remove Kavanaugh from office if he was confirmed and if the Democrats would be majority in the House of Representatives.
c. "I will say this <0xE2><0x80><0x93> if I don't speak the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then it is not only appropriate to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court when he is right now," said Pelosi.
aku Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal.
phelosi added that if a Democrat was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Price Service Act or Roe's case against Wade, because he is said to be a conservative judge.
in his proof prosecution, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he could change certain Supreme Court decisions.
a "Not the time of the angry man, the prejudice to the court and expect we to say, 'It's not odd,'" said Pelosi.
and women should use it.
is a good nightmare of bitterness, months and years of much more wrath and can't get rid of it without crying.

he continued," I was very much helped by a woman who was active somewhere, who said he was also crying when he got angry, but he formed a technique that meant that when he was upset and started crying, he could tell the person he was talking to," You might think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
then went on to explain to me.

about how trade war between the United States and China can benefit Beijing
the opening voices in the trade war between the United States and China were very disturbing and although the war will not soon end, the difference between countries may be beneficial to Beijing for a long time, according to professionals.
ora Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by charging important Chinese sales including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
the most impacted contrast started this week with a new tribute affecting <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) value products, thus charging half of all the goods entering the United States from China.
ii Beijing is always in revenge, has recently placed a five to ten percent tribute for <0x24><0x36>0 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to coordinate the U.S. measures, and the second-largest economic country does not seem desperate at any time soon.
to make Washington change the move means you should accept terms, but openly accepting the pressure of the United States will be a great embarrassment for <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
ado still, professionals say that if Beijing can play its game well, the difficulty of trade war against the United States can help China for a long time by reducing support between the two countries.
c. "The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create an environment that can begin to change in an economy in any country between him and more dangerous than others previously thought," said Abigail Grace, a research partner who is considering Asia at the new US Security Advisory Center.
