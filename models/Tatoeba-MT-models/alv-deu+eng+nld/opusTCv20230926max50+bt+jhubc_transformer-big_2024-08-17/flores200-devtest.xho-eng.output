It is difficult for a person to determine the needs of amino-acids using the available plants.
Furthermore, doing so often has a negative effect: the growth of stress, malnutrition, and death in the end.
The most readily available material for protein plants that are found in leaves and cremes, but the material or people they eat is difficult to clean up by the process of contamination except for cooking.
On the other hand, animal nutrients (aboves, bubbles, eggs) are easier to drop, and have high-quality amino acids that contain all amino acids.
All of the things we consider, we should not be surprised that our ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in the same way as the wild chimpanzees today.

Automobile traffic is learned by the flow of each driver and car from one place to another and how they interact with each other.
Sadly, learning the speed of the vehicle is difficult because the driver's speeds are not perfectly predictable.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave well among the right range; however, road channels tend to have the right consistency and can be represented in mathematics.
To be a better representative of transit, a relationship is established among the three main characteristics: (1) walk, (2) tension, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in planning, designing, and working on the road.
