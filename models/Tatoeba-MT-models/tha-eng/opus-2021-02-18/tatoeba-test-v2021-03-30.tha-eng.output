Birds fly.
Tom said Mary didn't think John did that.
The more you have, the more you lose.
I'm used to working hard.
I don't need to answer your questions.
I thought they could hear us.
It's clear.
I said good-bye to Tom.
God created you with a purpose.
There's something you need to know.
I don't understand.
Where's your father?
If you're interested, let me know, and I'll give you his number.
Where's your school?
The will is voided by the court.
God loves you.
What school did you go to?
I've seen dogs.
Elephants eat grass.
What is that thing?
That's probably what influenced their decision.
I trust you.
She fought to the end.
He was poor for a long time, but now he's good.
She respects her boss as much as her father.
Do you know who broke the window?
I told them to send me another ticket.
I said it.
You ready?
Listen up.
Because they're watching TV.
I'm thirsty.
I hate Tom for a lot of reasons.
Awesome!
Stay out of this. Do whatever you want.
It's just a word.
Jump.
Sometimes it's necessary to hide the truth.
Soup is too hot. I can't eat it.
Tom reminded Mary that she had to do that today.
Is Tom really going to do that today?
It's a trap.
Is Tom the guy?
Who knows?
Follow me.
Mind your own business.
Do you eat peppers?
Mary's picking berries in the woods.
Two adults.
I know.
I live here.
Open the door for love.
I'm the one they want.
These are for you.
He looked up at the sky.
Don't worry.
You gotta be kidding me.
Use this.
Drive carefully.
Are you busy?
Where do you live?
Can I borrow your phone?
Let's try something.
Tom said he asked for it.
I'm a reporter.
There's a lot of islands in the sea.
I got you!

I want your love.
Do you remember?
How long have you been talking to Tom?
I'm free this evening.
You have pretty eyes, don't you?
Why would Tom do that today?
The weather was great yesterday.
It's mine.
It's true.
You're a little busy right now.
I like you.
How much do you charge me for washing my laundry?
What's my punishment?
You shouldn't break your promise.
Japan's climate is weaker than Britain.
It took Jane 20 hours to fly to Japan.
So let's do something.
I don't have to answer that.
We eat three meals a day.
I get 100 euros a day.
Is it far from here?
I was 19 years old.
I don't have time right now.
Tom says he's happy to do it.
I wouldn't do that.
I like your offer.
Do you think Tom can help us?
I can't eat chocolate.
Is that what you're saying?
I always prefer the mystery character.
We saw him as a good senior.
Does your husband have any enemies?
We are a nation that loves peace.
Using computers helps you save time.
People don't like what they don't understand.
Tom's words ended with a positive comment.
What do you think of Tom's attitude?
Out of the way.
Tom snores, too.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
I just don't know what to say.
I'm studying the Burmese language.
That's great!
I need you.
You need to control yourself.
Respect yourself, and they will respect you.
Social change is a necessity there.
What motive did Tom have for doing that?
He decided to be a pilot.
How's Australia?
Unbelievable!
I can't help you, even though I pity you.
That's the stupidest thing I ever said.
Please don't feed the pigeons.
I have a lot of work to do.
Are we going to watch a movie now?
The real problem is you don't even know we're in trouble.
Did you really tell Tom that?
This is a pen.
I had curry yesterday.
I can't eat this.
Your answer is wrong.
Show me.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
We love you.
I like Japanese girls.
What are you thinking about?

She has music skills.
This is for Tom.
He speaks Chinese.
Warn Tom.
I see the target.
Do you have enough money?
Two boys looking for water.
She grew up to be a woman who was ready.
My stomach hurts.
I think everyone should learn another language.
Follow him.
You see?
I might give up and take a nap instead.
Tom and Mary are both Canadian.
That sounds fun. I want to try it.
Don't worry. I'll protect you.
It's a harp.
He asked me what my name was.
The product must not spring up quickly into a thriving city.
I'm single.
Do you want to say good-bye?
Tom and I will be fine.
What does a man want?
I'm hot.
There's a blue notebook on the table.
You can speak French.
It's up to you.
Some people say you shouldn't check your e-mail first thing in the morning.
I have time.
I'll try to cook.
How long did Tom say he'd be here?
I'm not gonna die.
What do you want to eat?
We have a lot of time, so drive safely.
The air is soft and the soil is damp.
What kind of person are you?
Life is beautiful.
He bought a new car.
I'm out.
Nothing happened.
Admit what you said. I still think you're wrong.
What are you talking about?
How many best friends do you have?
Frees!
See, humans don't create time, because if we do, time won't run out.
The best book about life is life.
You're not my mother.
Tom, do you have to go?
He ran.
What is it?
Help Tom.
Is Tom at school?
I'm a cook, a cook.
I don't know how I did it.
Get a job.
Why can't you come?
No one but Tom did that.
I love RB.
How old are you?
There was a bridge here once.
Do you want to do it with me?
Wow!
I'm a cop.
There's a solution to every problem.
Tom lost.
How's your mom?
Whenever I find something I like, it's too expensive.
You missed that, didn't you?
I have the right to criticize.
I miss you.
I try to be positive all the time.
We'll be there at 2:30.
Arabic will read from right to left.
That's what Tom said.
She smiled.
He's got a lot of money.
You can't live without water.
I wouldn't say that.
This is a cat.
I've seen UFO plates.
I don't blame you.
Tom's dog is much bigger than Mary's.
I'm on my way.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
We have a problem, too.
I'm sick.
Try it.
Why do you ask?
Can I borrow your book for a second?
It's a TV.
The vocabulary is the basis of language.
She's a dog.
I can't eat.
Answer the question.
What do you want from me?
How did Tom do that?
That looks delicious. I'll try it.
She begged him to stay.
I work.
Try again.
He's supposed to be my sister's best husband.
I've got two cats.
This is the book you're looking for.
How's Tom?
Muriel is 20 years old.
What's this for?
Stop!
We won.
Respect yourself, and you'll get respect.
It's me.
Who washed your clothes for you?
They opened the door.
It's okay.
I'm a teacher.
I'm a parietal scleroderma.
I'm fine.
You should let Tom do what he wants to do.
No problem.
She was afraid that cancer would kill her husband before their great-great-grandson was born.
Any job can be miserable.
I'll be fine.
He used to collect bugs when he was a kid.
Pow.
I think it's best not to be polite.
I was in him.
This is a lemon tree.
She's pregnant.
He believes they've destroyed it.
Tom said Mary was coming over for dinner.
Tom likes Mary?
The watch has two hands.
We took a boat across the river.
Look out!
You bet.
I like him.
You look pale.
You're so impatient with me.
He likes adventures.
Tom lied.
I can't eat pork.
There's the bus.
We're number one.
I wonder why Tom would do that.
Please open this box.
Have you ever seen how to make sausages?
You're not gonna like this.
Don't waste your time on nonsense.
That's impossible!
Who's Tom?
I'll be there even if it rains.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
Make a note of what's going on.
This word has two meanings, then situation 1. Today is a very bad day.
There's hardly a student with a full grade in Chinese traditionals.
Even if he's sorry, I'm still angry.
Tom found an old safe in the garage.
She doesn't have a lot of friends in Kyoto.
Santa's at the North Pole.
You laundry your own clothes?
Tom's a member of the book club.
You're tired, aren't you?
I can't go.
Tom had three kids.
The virus is spreading rapidly.
In the worst case, we're going to have to look as happy as possible.

The football might cancel because it's raining.
So let's do that!
Do you have coffee?
What do you want me to do with all this?
You should've knocked on the door before you came in.
Answer me.
Consider the worst possible.
I can't go.
No new books.
Are you tired?
He translates poetry.
In Canada, people speak English and French.
You're not gonna do it?
I found that thing she was looking for.
He doesn't know anything.
Time to wake Tom.
No, my passport is gone!
Most of us want to do that.
One is to tell you to choose one of the two. To flip a coin, pick a head or a tail.
Good-bye!
It's not my fault.
He's drunk.
It's raining.
Are you writing letters?
Hi, I'm Tom.
What does that mean?
I'm going with Tom and Mary.
Tom's not good in French.
She'll make a good wife.
Is that you?
Tom doesn't want to talk to Mary.
We'll have lunch at 12:30.
Tom's down.
Should we do this?
I'm looking for someone to wash clothes for me.
How does that relate to me?
Kovid-19 turned the patient's cells into a virus factory.
During the summer, I went to the sea. During the winter, I went to the mountains.
Have fun.
I wonder why Tom didn't come to Mary's party.
I'm Thai.
Keep your medicine away from the child's hands and eyes.
Get him!
Can I help you?
He ran.
Who?
Construction started October 20, 2006.
I woke up.
All humans are born free and equal in honor and rights, and they are given reason and conscience and should be treated with the spirit of a brother.
What are you awake for?

Tom's room is locked.
What does Tom want to achieve?
How much is that TV?
I'm going to school.
Communism was a political system in the Soviet Union, but it was stopped in 1993.
Tom wants to do that.
Get Tom.
My mom's been sick for months.
The beach's not far from here.
It's his.
He's sleeping like a baby.
"Thank you." "It's okay."
Would you like some tea or coffee?
Tom wants you to do it.
Where are you from?
I love you.
Do you have a pen in your car?
What time is it?
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
My job just started.
All humans are born free and equal in dignity and rights, everyone has the right to reason and conscience, and should treat each other as brothers.
I'm the baker. I'm the one who made the bread.
Why me?
Tom lied.
Allow students to miss school.
Where is he?
What's the name of the boy?
Tom's here.
Tom bought the cheapest stuff in the store.
He's young, but he's actually over 40 years old.
She walked.
I've finished reading this book.
I don't speak Indonesia very well.
Women have pretty cheeks.
How could Tom do that?
I'll be back soon.
Tom said he wanted to do that.
This is what always was.
Do you like oranges?
We agree.
I like apples.
I'm going to study French for a semester.
Try not to be late again tomorrow.
Tom hasn't washed the dishes yet.
I love you more than you love me.
I lost my wallet.
Your watch is ten minutes late.
Tom, run!
Tom and I are fine.
I convinced Tom to stay in Boston until Monday.
It's cold.
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.
I feel for you in depth.
I only have one book.
It's none of your business.
He's leaving Chicago tomorrow.
I'm looking around.
I hope we didn't wake you.
I don't know if I have time.
You should study more.
We're okay.
What did Tom want?
I fainted.
He doesn't have kids.
Tom.
I didn't know she was that old.
Turn on the radio.
Do you like Japanese?
Don't do that.
Who are you?
My mom's crazy.
I was wondering where to put the picture Tom gave me.
I don't eat apples.
Tom and Mary have to do that?
Is that from Tom?
My mother carefully opened the door.
Of course!
What made Tom not come yesterday?
Every morning I go shopping.
I can't live like that.
Are these yours?
That's it.
I'm sad.
Where is he?
Give me a day or two.
I think it's the best way to do it.
What do you think of Tom's poetry?
I'm afraid they didn't get along so well.
I'm sorry. I can't go.
How lonely this world would be without you.
This chair is comfortable.
We've received a lot of positive feedback.
I'm going to let things go the way they are to avoid trouble.
It was so hot yesterday.
Go get a job.
Where are you?
Respect yourself, and you'll get respect.

I like tea.
It's hard to take an interest in breaking rules.
I'm a professional.
The password is "Muriel."

Helen Keller is blind, deaf and mute.
There's a snake in the garden.
Tom drew this on his own?
I saw him run.
I'm afraid we're too late.
Is your mom home?
I've been asking around, and everyone says Tom's a good guy.
Did you see the sun rise just now? It's beautiful.
We went to the beach.
I finally have the courage to tell you, "I love you!"
Where are you going?
I wish I could do it myself.

The food is finally here on the table.
I'm from Budapest.
Who do you mean?
Hello, world.
Perfect!
Okay, that's it.
Call the police!
God, I object.
It's time to go to sleep.
I'm tired.
For oral use.
I don't know if I have time.
We went to the museum to study Japanese history.
Wipe your sweat off your forehead.

We can't do that right now.
Tom likes it there.
I love Chinese food.
Have you eaten?
Social culture is changing in each country.
Is this the book you're looking for?
Most people write about their daily lives.
Cheers!
I had a cat.
Tom said bad things about me.
She's smoking.
Tom's imagination is triggered.
No one asked me.
Nothing can succeed without a struggle.

You're in a better shape than I am.
Tom didn't expect this.
The color suits you.
I want to try it.
I'm not going to school.
Tell Tom.
Good evening.
Get him!
This is Japan.
He's just a politician.
Are you pregnant or just fat?
It's fake. It's fake.
I won't be happy, but I won't kill myself.
We'll have lunch at 12:30.
I don't know if you know, but you should tip the waitress in America.
Am I wrong?
I want to say good-bye.
Is this your car?
Are you okay?
This pile of books is for me, and that pile is for him.
We're fine.
He fulfilled his promise.
It's kind of weird for me.
We're just kidding.
What did they say?
What are you and Tom doing?
How was work?
Tom swings.
I want to go for a walk in the country.
Yeah?
Say goodbye.
Take Tom.
We should celebrate.
Everything's ready.
What are you doing?
Please come in. The door's open.
That's not gonna happen.
Tom and Mary said they didn't plan on doing that.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Tom might know Mary.
The easiest solution is always the best.
I did it!
I hope you can come with us.
