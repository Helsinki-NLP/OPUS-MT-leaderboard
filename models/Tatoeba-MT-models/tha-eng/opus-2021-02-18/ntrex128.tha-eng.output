The members of Wells are very concerned about being viewed as a clown.
Some people even propose to rename their position to MWPs.
This is due to a plan to change the name of the Parliament of Wales.
The political authority is concerned that this may lead to ridicule.
One working member said that his group was concerned, "This name will be consistent with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Wells, twp means stupid, and pwp means waste.
One palid member said that the whole group was in agreement with each other and that there was another offer.
Wells conservatives said that their group was wide open about this name change, but that's just a brief change from MWP to YouTube.
In this context, the letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English of Yerkshire.
"The final decision in the direction of the summons of any member of the royal family, which is now creating a law for change in the name of the name, will certainly affect your members."
According to Wells government law, 2017 has authorized the University of Wales to change its name.
In June last year, the commission published a public conference that was widely encouraged to call the Congress of Wales.
As to the position of a member of the National Council of Congress of Wales or WMPs, at the same time, the MWP has more public support for public discussion.
A member of the National Assembly also has some other options, but it's going to become more of a headache for Elin Jones, who is the president of this conference, and who's expected to file a draft law on this change within the next few weeks.
The reform laws include changing other matters as well as the method of work, the rules of law enforcement, the system design of judges.
A member of the National Assembly will receive final votes, which will be the decision on how they should be called to discuss this law.
The McSydoneans voted for change in the country.
The voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether the country should be renamed as the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
It's been organized to present the solution to a decade-long collection of disputes with a Greek neighbor whose state of affairs is also called MacDydonia.
Athens has always insisted that the names of its northern neighbors point to its borders and that there has been constant objections to offering its membership as members of the EU and NETO.
Gorge Ivanov, president of Macedonia, did not approve of this resolution of change of name, and said that he would ignore this resolution.
However, the A.C. support group, including the prime minister, Zaev, argued that this change in name was worth attending EU and NaTO.
St. Martin's church bell is silent.
"The old people I talked to told me that there were bars and churchs in the past," said Mr. Adam.
"Now there's no more."
He said that missing the bar would make sense.
"People are socially different from before," he said.
"The bar is no longer a living room in the neighborhood where people are going to be routines."
For the church, he was concerned that the money that sold them might not last as long as the leaders expected, "Soon they'll have to go back to where they were."
He added that the church was replaced by a condo building full of people who didn't save the rest of the neighborhood.
"The majority of the people who flocked to buy those condos are white," he said, "this is a factor that's speeding down these churches, because people who moved into their condos don't think that they're a member of these churches."
These two churches were originally built by a white community before Harlem became a great black-town city community in 1870, and they built St. Martin's church in a decade.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community in the neighborhood where they used to worship went to church.
The black community took over St. Martin's church under the leadership of Reverend Johnson, a black-man retail leader on 125th Street, which is the main shopping road of Harlem, who resists or promotes black employment.
In 1939, a great fire devastated the church, and when the students of Reverend Johnson were planning to rebuild the church, a bell set was also built.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and successor of St. Martin's Church, is proud to say of this bell suit as "the bells of the poor man."
The experts who came to play the bell series in July said of this bell suit in another way: "The cultural treasure" and "The uncomplicated musical instrument."
Tiffny Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also observed that this was the first bell series in the world played by a black musician named Dinisio A. Lind who moved to play a bell suit 18 years ago that was larger than the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merweather said that St. Martin's Church had no one to replace him after that.
What happened to St. Martin's Church over the last several months was a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of whom came by drawing from local church leaders, some of whom came by the advice of the royal staff.
The council -- which was composed of local leaders -- wrote to the patriarchs, concerned that the patriarchs were "find ways to throw expenses" to the council, although the council had nothing to do with hiring architects and those contractors sent in by the authorities.
Some of the students complained that the monks were without transparency.
Sharks attack 13-year-olds while diving for lobsters in California.
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while he was diving to find a lobster in California at the opening of the lobster season.
This incident occurred before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon Beach at Encilintas.
Chad Hamel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour that Saturday morning, when he heard the cry for help, he swam in groups to get this kid out of the water.
Hamel said at first he thought that the noise was exciting to catch the lobster, but then he "remembered it was screaming 'I was bit!
I got bit!'
Hamel said that when he reached the child, he saw the child's clavicle ripped open."
"I shouted to everyone, keep out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hamel more.
The boy was carried to the Randy Child Hospital at San Diego, where it was reported to be severely ill.
No one knows what the shark that attacked this kid is.
Captain Lifeguard Larry Giles said to a reporter roughly that a few weeks ago, a shark was seen in the area, but it wasn't a dangerous species.
The girl adds that the victim was injured in the upper body area.
After that, the beach was shut down from Ponto Beach at Casablad to Swami's at Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and to be safe.
The girl noticed that there were more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them were not dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan was to push himself into the beauty market in England.
Sainsbury's will replace Butts, Superdug and Debenhams with a shopping mall style with an assistant who specializes in counseling.
Pushing yourself in a concrete fashion to enter a beauty market in England that sells 2.8 million pounds and still continues to grow while fashion sales and household equipment are down, this huge beauty store will experiment with 11 shops across the country and add more stores next year if this plan is successful.
The department store wanted to look for ways to use space on a shelf to replace the goods that were once a TV microwave and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said to double the beauty product with over 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first presentation.
The original brands, such as L'Oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees, also get more space in the brand section, as they do in stores like Butts.
On the supermarket's side, it's re-bootic mashup, so most of the goods are friendly to health lovers -- that's what new shoppers want to do.
Meanwhile, the French Pop perfume trader will also try two Sainsbury's perfume shops, which the first one launched in Croydon, south of London, last week, and the second will open at Seeey Oak, Airingham later this year.
The online shopping and consumer behavior change to a little bit of food at a convenience store, which suggests that supermarkets have to find a way to get consumers to use more.
Mike Coupe, the high-ranking executive of Sainsbury's, said that the outlets were more likely to look like a mall, since the supermarket was in the same group, trying to fight the store with lower prices like Aldi and Lidl with more food and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos outlets in over a hundred different stores, and there's been a number of presentations since they bought the two Shanes two years ago, where Sansbury's said to encourage the sales of grocery stores to increase profits.
Before, the supermarket tried to improve the beauty and the drug department, but it failed.
Sainsbury's experiment with Butts early in 2000, but this bond ended after they couldn't agree on their share of the supermarket income.
So a new strategy arose after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacys to Celesio, owner of Shane Loys Parisy, worth 125 million pounds three years ago.
Sainsbury's said that Loyds would be involved in this plan by adding Luxury's Procey brands, such as La Roche-Posey and Vickey, four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the trades of Sainsbury's, said: "We've had a transformation of the appearance and atmosphere of the new store to add great feelings to the customers.
We also have an investment to encourage our employees to have special training, to give good advice to their customers.
In addition to our brands designed for all needs, there's a comfortable location in the environment that's attractive and appealing, which means that we're going to be the center of the old beauty shopping challenge."
Peter Jones' 'so angry 'after Holly willoughby's 11 million pounds of business together.
Peter Jones, an actor in Dragons Den, sank to the 'aggravation' after a Hollywood TV presentation, withdrew from his 11 million-pound life style business, and took a fresh look at her contract with Marks and Spyr and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for domestic brands and supplements under their Tracy brands.
Both of their businesses have been compared to Goop's Gwenth Paltrow.
This 37-year-old presensor, 37, announced in her instagram that she was going to resign.
Holly willoughby left Peter Jones, the actor of Dragons Den, to live with his anger by withdrawing from his profitable lifestyle in the last second and focusing on her new contract with Marks & Spyr and ITV.
Sources say Jones' "exactly angry" when the golden girl of the TV channel admitted to the conference on Tuesday at the head of his business kingdom in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contract was worth 1.5 million pounds - which meant that she would no longer have time for their household appliances and tralysing equipment.
This business has been compared to the Gonneth Paltrow's Goop, which had been sold down, and has doubled the sale of willoughby's estimate of 11 million pounds.
As soon as Willoughby, 37 years old, announced in Instagram that she would leave Tracy Jones, would fly out of England to one of his vacations as soon as possible.
One source says: "Truly was the top priority of Holly.
Because that's her long-term future, which she could see could lead to more than two decades.
The decision she made to withdraw would certainly shock everyone involved.
No one's gonna believe this happened last Tuesday, because it's almost the day of the launch.
And there's a whole warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that the death of the Presensor, this time Moring, one of the most successful light stars in Britain, will damage this business for millions of dollars because of the heavy investment in goods, from pillows, candles, and clothing, and the launch that could be delayed.
And that means the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, willoughby, and the husband of Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife Tara Kappa for ten years.
Willoughby founded Tracy with Kappa in 2016, and Jones, age 52, joined by holding the president in March.
The two families used to go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV company.
Willoughby is a branded Ambasser for M+S, and will be a substitute for Ant McArtlin on the I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
"We can't comment on this," said Jones' close source last night.
'And we fell in love.'
He's making a joke about the criticism he gets from the media that some people feel "no president" and the very positive view of North Korean leaders.
Why does President Trump give up so much?
Trump, speaking in the voice of "a reporter."
"We didn't give up anything."
He noticed that Kim was interested to meet the second time after his first meeting in Singapore in June, which Tremp praised for the reduction in nuclear weapons.
But the negotiations for nuclear disarmament stopped.
North Korean high officials, Ri Young Ho, spoke to the world leader at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday.
But instead, he noticed that the United States still allows constant pressure.
But Trump still had a positive view of his negotiations at that time.
"We're going well with North Korea," he said.
"In the past, we were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
But now we have a very good relationship."
He said that attempts to connect with Kim brought positive results -- the rocket test was over, helped the remaining hostages and American soldiers get home.
And he argued about the unusual behavior when he was asked about his relationship with Kim:
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out here gather around here, we're only putting 200 people here," said Tramp, pointing at the crowd standing in front of him.
Tsunami and an earthquake in one of Indonesia killed hundreds of people.
Smoke struck by earthquakes at Lombok. For example, foreign private organizations were told they were not wanted.
Even though more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to evacuate, there was no press conference about the disasters in the country, the international assistance needed immediately.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they're very clear that they don't need foreign help, it's a challenge," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Childen team for the trip to Palu, it's still not clear that foreign officials can land.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disasters Agency, says that Indonesia officials are assessing the situation at Palu, whether to allow foreign agencies to intervene.
Even if Indonesia endured a constant earthquake, it is still still not ready to deal with the tragic anger of nature.
While the tsunami shelter was created at the aceh, it could not be seen on the other coasts.
Despite the tsunami warning, apparently the lack of tsunamis at Palu has resulted in death.
And in the normal time, the journey between islands in Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make transportation more difficult.
A nurse ship usually parked in Lombok to treat an earthquake victim had to act first at Palu, but on the journey to the site of this new disaster, it would take at least three days.
President Joko Wido raised the issue of developing the rising infrastructure of Indonesia as his main campaign, and he put a lot of money into making roads and trains.
And the lack of funds caused Mr. Joko's administration to get in trouble, because next year he's going to be re-entering the election program.
Mr. Joko is still facing the stress of the delay of a party member in Indonesia, where most of the members are Muslims and still have traditional beliefs.
Over 1,000 people were killed, and hundreds of thousands had to evacuate their homes because the Christian and Muslim gangs fought each other in the streets with arrows and other deadly weapons.
Watch: Daniel Stewart, the Liverpool team, always score, Cheelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpol from defeating Shelsa in Premier Legue by taking a score in the minute of 89 on Saturday at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge picked up a ball passed from Xherdan Shaqiri, 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind with a 1-0 score.
He touched the ball with a light left before the spoon came up and shot it at a column that was far away.
It's high above the goal, and it's floating in the upper right corner of the net.
That ball is crossing Kappa Arizabalga, which is jumping up and into the net.
"It's just trying to get as close to that position as possible to the ball and Shaq, which Shaq usually plays forward as much as possible, and I'm just trying to make the most of it as possible."
"I saw Kante coming, so I touched it once, and I didn't think much, just shoot."
Shelsea leads one-nil in half-time, after Eden's star of Belgian scores in a minute of 25.
That shot, the Blue Lion's front kicks the ball back to Matheo Kovacic, before you turn around to the middle and run toward the other half of Liverpool.
Kovaac is sending-and-go fast to the Central.
Then he quickly sent a beautiful ball through to the Hadard, imported it to the goal of the goal.
Hazard ran faster than the rear, and ended up kicking with his left leg across Allison Becker's Liverpool into the goal.
Livool will fight Napoli at a group at Champions Lake, 3 p.m. Wednesday afternoon at Stadio San Palo in Naples, Italy.
Shelsea will meet with Videtoon in UEFA,Eurpa Legage at 3:00 p.m. Thursday, London.
The report on the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami reports have increased to 832 people, and the National Disaster Service said on Sunday morning.
A lot of people have been reported trapped in the rock bricks of an earthquake 7.5 Magnitude building and followed by a giant wave of over 20 meters above 20 meters on Friday.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, has become a city full of ruins of buildings that collapsed.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man with suspicion of murder after the body of a woman stabbed to death.
The murder investigation went on to the scene after a body was found in the body of a woman at Bergenhead, Mercyside this morning.
A young woman about 44 years old, multiple stab wounds were found at the dawn of Grayson Street, with a 32-year-old male arrested for suspected murder.
The police have asked the local people to see or hear anything, so please come and speak to the police.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is still in the first place, but I would like to ask anyone near John Street in Bergenhead to see or hear anything suspicious, please contact us.
Especially for cab drivers who might be able to capture a camera in front of the car, please address us, because it might be an important piece of information in our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the female body was found, who lived in Bergenhead, and that was found inside the building.
And this afternoon, friends who believed they knew a young lady came to the scene and asked where she was found this morning.
The investigation was continued by the police saying that they were in the process of contact with the relatives of the deceased.
One cab driver who lives at Grayson Nows tried to ask back into his flat, but the police said no one could enter or leave the building right now.
He couldn't speak after what happened.
Now, the residents of this building are told it would take hours for them to be allowed back into the building.
One of the cops heard someone tell a man that this area is already a murder scene.
The girl in this scene cried out in tears.
And I said, "It's scary."
At 2:00 P.M., two police vans were parked inside the perimeter fence, and the other one was outside.
There were several officers standing within the perimeter fence and observing these flats.

The Cromwell statue is now a popular story about "New History."
Exiled was justice in his spell of destruction, which was the cultural and religious invention of the British that was carried by his strict followers.
But the Cromwell Society said of Mr. Crick's proposal, "It's foolishness" and "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of Crumwell Society, said: "Of course, the goal of this debate is to move the statue of Oliver Clarke outside the Westminster Palace.
The destruction of the British Civil War was neither in command nor in operation by Crumwell.
Perhaps the accused Cromwell had sacrificed himself to what Thomas' ancestors had done in the centuries then.
Mr. Willium Hamo Thornycroft's beautiful 19th century commentary on Cromour, is a 19th-century comment, and part of a history study of people who still believe it's worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph:
That's all true presentations, historical topics that need to be discussed.
What's certain is that the conflict that took place in the mid-17s has developed the country that we see today, and that Crowell is one of the people who was reminded of that division.
His success as Lord Protetor is therefore worthy of celebration and memorial."
A pig-killing Chinese farmer to death.
According to local news, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China.
The man only knew his name, Yuan, was found bleeding in a blood pool near the market in Liupshui, Guido County, the South China Morning Post, reported on Sunday.
This pig farmer was prepared to be immunized to a pig in a shed at Xining, Qing, China, on the 30th of November 2005.
According to the news, he was traveling to Yun Nan County, the neighborhood next to his cousin to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and found that the door to the pigs next door was open.
He said one very large pig in the shed had blood on her mouth.
According to the report, the legal record confirms that this 450-pound pig has been mauling this farmer to death.
"My brother's leg is full of blood and decay" -- a cousin named Wu, quoted in the Guiyang Evening News newspaper.
Security evidence shows Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pig.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed this man was neither Yuan nor his cousin's.
The market manager told the paper that the pig was already trapped in order to prevent another attack while the police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
According to the news, the Yuan family is negotiating with the market administrator for the compensation of his death.
Although the case of pig attacks on humans to the point of death is very small, it appears that there was a record earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a young woman and her husband at their farm at Massachustes, and the husband was seriously injured.
And ten years ago, there was a 650-pound pig that grabbed a Wells farmer and his tractor until his wife had to come out and scare him off.
Then, after a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told cBC News that it was not aggressive, but the taste of blood could be "the trigger."
"They're just playful.
They like to bite, they're curious. They don't mean to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them properly," he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brought heavy rain to the southwest of the United States.
According to the prophecy, Hurricane Rosa was weakened after blowing through the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rain north of Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa had a winds that blew 85 miles per hour, a level 1 hurricane on Sunday, at 5 o'clock in the east time, and at 385 miles south of Panta Egunia, Mexico.
It's expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the winds are rising over the Pacific Ocean and moving east to the western coast of the United States, as Rosa approaches the Baja Sea on Monday, in a tropical storm that starts to sweep boldly into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to all parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical humidity interacts with the approaching winds, causing heavy rain on every area of the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, the 1 to 4 inches of rain could cause immediate flooding, debris, and maybe landslides in the desert.
The dense tropical humidity causes the raindrops to reach up to 2 to 3 inches per hour in different points, especially parts of Nevada and Arizona.
It's expected that the rain that falls all over the Southwest will reach 2-4 inches, but there will be more in Arizona area.
With thunderous thunders, as a result of a sudden flood and can increase violence.
Let the people not pass by foot into the desert in the abundance of tropical rain.
The heavy rain may cause the deep valley to become a flowing river, and the thundering of wind and dust to gush forth.
This approaching wave brings heavy rain in the southern coast of California.
More than half an inch of rain could cause a small floating waste and a slippery road.
This is expected to be the first rainfall in the region.
Some of the tropical rains will start approaching Arizona later on Sunday and Monday morning before it spreads all over the line on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and will extend until Wednesday.
During October, the high temperatures were moving across the U.S. because the Arctic began to cool down, but the Tropics were still warm.
Sometimes this event brings increasing and changing temperatures in neighboring cities.
There's a very good example of different climates in the middle of the U.S. last Sunday.
By a town with nearly 20-degree difference in temperature, such as between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
And in the next few days, the warmth of the gentle summer will form and spread.
Most of the Central and eastern parts of the United States expect to see this warm start in October, with the wind spreading about 80s from southern areas to parts of the North.
New York City may have up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is 10 degrees taller than normal.
Our long-term forecasts showed that there was a high probability that the eastern temperature of the United States in the first half of October would be higher than usual.
There are over 20 million people watching Brett Kavanaugh's speech.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched the testimony presentation of the Convicted Court of the Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Bleisy Ford, from the Six Version Networks, the young girl who accused him of attempted rape in 1980.
Meanwhile, political conflicts continue, television stations change the normal program on Friday at the last second, because Senator Jeffina Sen. Jeff Fake has allowed the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the crime.
Ford told the National Congress board that she was 100 percent confident that Kavanah had touched her drunk and tried to strip her of her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh confirmed with a prison temper that he's 100 percent confident that the event is not certain.
Nelson reported on Friday that there should be more than 20.4 million people watching this opening.
The company is counting the average numbers of audiences in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
But you can't immediately count the audience on other networks, such as PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nelson usually has trouble counting audiences in offices and offices.
To compare it to a picture, the size of the audience is the same as the audience of the semi-finals or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, the station that actively supported Kavanah's appointment, has been leading every network with a peak of about 5.69 million audiences in all day's hearing, Nelson.
ABC comes in second with a peak of 3.26 million people.
CBS has a total of 3.1 million NBC, a peak of 2.94 million, a peak of 2.89 million, and a CNN of 2.52 million Nelson.
Attention is still at high ground after the hearing is over.
Fake is the main character in what happened on Friday.
After a non-inflammatory rebablic's office announced that he might vote for Kavanah, the CNN and CBS cameras caught it on Friday morning that he was yelled at by protestors as he tried to get into the elevator to settle with the October Committee.
CNN's been live, his picture's been hanging for a few minutes after he was yelled at.
"I stand before you now," said a woman to him.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the whole country?
"You have power while women have no power," he said.
Flake said that his agency had made a statement, and that before the elevator closed, he had a lot to say to the board about this hearing.
Kable and television stations have been live-timed to broadcast the moment when the Board of votes to drive from the nomination of Kavanaugh to vote for full senator.
But Flegg said he would only do that if the FBI checked allegations related to the appointment next week, which is a request from the voice of the democrats.
In some of his friends' conversations, Senator Dimocactic Chris Cunes felt convinced.
And after talking to Coons and several senators, Flegg made his decision.
The Flex selection is powerful, because it's obvious that the Responsibilities won't vote for Kavanaugh without the fact first.
President Trump opened the way for the FBI to investigate the facts regarding the allegations involving Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accused the critics of playing politics against Brixit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics that her plan to leave the European Union of playing politics against the future of England and ruining national interests.
The British prime minister, Teresa May, traveled to the Conservative Party conference at Birmingham, the U.S. Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview on the front page of the same newspaper next to her interview, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, hit her very hard on what she calls a chess eye plan for Breexit, offering the U.K. and the European Union, "E."
Vayde Sims was shot: police arrested Dytheon Sympson in the death of the LSU team.
Police arrested a suspect in a violent shooting, which is why 20-year-old Wayne Sims, LSU basketball player, died.
"Dytone Sympson, 20, arrested and booked for murder, which is a second-degree crime, says the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The police said that the encounter with Sims and Sympson in the official video revealed that during the fight, Sims lost his glasses.
And when the police found those glasses at the crime scene, they found Simson's DNA on them, and CBS joined the WAFB report.
The police added that, after questioning Sympson, he confessed that he had shot Vayde severely.
Advocate reports that his bail money was set at $350,000.
A preliminary report from East Baton Rouge Parish Colonier's Office on Friday said that the cause of death was a gunshot wound from head to neck.
The police gave credit to the Louisiana State Police Escape Special Operations Agency, and citizens in that area were in the aid of investigations to lead to arrest.
The director of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the district law for "The Reservation and the Search for Justice."
Sims, 20 years old.
6-foot-6, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU, too.
He's got a 5.6 average score and a 2.6 for runnings in the latest season.
On Friday morning, the LSU game basketball team said that their team was "I'm so sorry" and "surprising" with the news of Wade's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcanoe sprays ash on Mexico City.
The ash from Mount Pocettel has arrived in a neighbor town in the south of the capital of Mexico.
The N.S.A. warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after detecting a reaction in the crater and to record the release of the gas and ash of 183 imsions over the last 24 hours.
The center has noticed multiple vibrations and noises.
Social Media shows ash covered in car windows in Mexico's neighbors, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicist observed that there was an increase in the volcanic reaction located at 45 miles, south of the capital, since the 7.1 magnitude shook central Mexico in September 2017.
That volcano is known as "Don Goyo", which has continued to be a eruption since 1994.
Police clashed with the Catalonian separatists before the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters were in support of the Declaration of Independence against the police in opposition to riots, while thousands of people were in a campaign to witness the first anniversary of the Catalonian vote on the Separatists.
A group of Separatists, covered in masks of eggs and paint powder, tried to block them, causing dust to spread out in the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
The action was so after that that the police had to use a baton to stop the attack.
And for hours, the Declarationists prayed, "Never forget, never forgive," competed with the union protesters who shouted, "Spain, live!"
Local media report that 14 people were hurt a little bit by protests and healings.
The tension in the region with the idea of independence remained high after a year, after a decision that Madrid thought was illegal, but the Catalonian Separatists still celebrated.
The voters have chosen independence to be overwhelmingly low, although the result is that most of those who opposed the division disbanded it.
According to the Catalonia authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the voters from going to the district elections, causing a violent collision.
A group of exclusive support groups camped across the Friday night to help the police protect their march.
The march continues but is forced to change course.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old fireman, joined in a campaign to divide the land with his wife, said he felt desperate.
"A year ago, we lived with one of our best memories.
I watched my parents cry out joyfully that we could use the vote, but now we're trapped," he said.
Despite the most important victory management in the district elections of December of last year, the Catalan Pro-Denence party still has a hard time keeping movement this year, because many well-known leaders, if not forcing themselves into exile, are in quarantine, awaiting a trial with their role in managing public opinion and declaration of freedom.
Joe Puiig, 42-year-old man, recorded the protests on his phone as evidence of police support, said that conflicts were dug up by both politicians.
"The tension grows more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oral Junqueras, one of the leaders of the Catalonia who had been in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would be running for the European Congress next year.
"Standing as a European election candidate is the best way to argue with the reverse value of democracy and subjugation that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Many of the men were arrested after driving into a house.
Three men, 33s, 34s and 39s, were arrested after a series of collisions with a house.
This incident was revealed at Blyard Crescent on Thursday, local time, about 19:30.

There was some wooden faces burning in the car.
Menga's strike ball has caused Livinston to beat the ringers to 1-0.
The first Gold was Dolly Menga for the victory of Livinston.
The victory of the Liveston scared the Ringers under the leadership of the Steven Gerrard as the manager of the Ibrox Club, who only lost twice in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's children proved the difference, while Gary Holt's side moved up second for Habernian.
On the side of the Girard still gives up hope to win the Premier Chip this season and meet the best team, which leads eight points next Sunday.
Before the game, the Rings meets Rapid Vienna in Eurole League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston won another six games by taking over Coach Holt's lead, but was defeated when he turned Kenny Miller last month.
Livyston missed a chance to meet with the visiting team.
The Holts are running far and wide, and they're freaking out for the Rankers.
Scott robinson can break into the front of Gold, and Alan Lithgow can help block Craig Hawthorne from reaching Gold.
She let Rakers play lead first because she knew she'd be good at messing with the visitors.
And that's the great story of Gold in this game.
The ringers got free kicks, and the Lionston Games Declan's Declans, and the Robinsons stormed out Menga, who can finally also touch bass and get points from the middle position.
At that time, the ringers had the baby, but couldn't break in, and the Gold Lim Kelly healers were able to block the problem.
Still, this pattern continues in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos is trying to protect him from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was extracted by the Gold Keeper of Randers, then Alan McGregor and Littlegow switched through and scored from Livingston again.
Game on in the Lionston field with two free throws, from the turning of Donald Middleton and once again from Hendball.
An analysis of the "great game" from Livingston.
Alsdair Lummont from BBC Scotland, reporting from Tony Macaroni Arena.
The great efficiency and results of the liveston.
Everyone on the team played brilliantly and above all expectations.
Both their patterns and their play have changed completely since they came back to their original positions and great credit to Holt and the alterations from their team.
He's made a lot of heroes.
Captain Holtt is the head of the defense and best control of the game, while Menga is still Connoor Goldson and Joe Warrall invasion.
Despite the lack of inspiration,
They lacked leadership, and far from the level they did most well in the days of the Garrard.
They missed the last ball just because they opened up the side channel to the fighting team, and that's when the ringers realized they were in the middle of a task force ready for the scrum.
Erdogan was well received and many at Colone.
Smiles and blue skies on Saturday, at a meeting of the Turkey and Germany leaders in Berlin.
It was the last day of a visit to the German country of President Erdogan, whose purpose was to merge with the Nato alliance.
They've been discussing issues, including human rights, media freedom, and the participation of the Turkish European Union.
Erdogan headed to Colone to open a large new mosque.
This is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police are claiming security reasons to intercept 25,000 people gathered in front of a mosque, but there are still many supporters in the neighborhood who want to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom are Kurdish, blame both the Erdogan policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflected a division for visitors that was regarded as some of the German Turks.

From Long Lharin Prison: Six officers were injured in a riot.
Six officers injured in a riot at a secure male prison.
The riots took place at HMP Long Latin in Worcestershire, local time, about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, and they continued.
The Tornado team of experts came in for a suspension of eight quarantines and put them on one wing.
Officer was a little injured at the crime scene's face.
"There will be delivery of a special prison officer, trained to deal with the ongoing disturbance at HMP Long Lartin.
There are six agents who need to be sent to medical care.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and it's clear that people will be passed over to the police, and that means they will be imprisoned for a long time."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the governor of the prison was admitted to the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, riot officers were called to put an end to a terrible riot that the prison authorities were attacked by a ball of Billards.
Hurricane Rosa attacked Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with a sudden flood.
It's a very rare event that a hurricane will strike Arizona, but it's going to happen early next week if the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosss through the Southwest desert, causing a sudden flood.
The National Weather Service has begun to watch a sharp flood on Arizona, west of the Nevada, east of Nevada, south of California and Utrónia and Utah, as well as cities in Phonix, Flagstas, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City from Monday to Tuesday.
It's expected that Rosa will blow through Phoenix on Tuesday, which will cause rain on Monday's line.
The Phoenix Weather Agency saw a message in Twitter that said, "Since 1950, only ten Cyclones have remained hot or good zones within 200 miles of Poenix.
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest model from the National hurricane center predicts that there will be between 2 and 4 inches of rain somewhere up to 6 inches high in the Moollon Rim area of Arizona.
Other parts of the Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, have between 1 and 2 inches of rain, and some of them may be as high as 4 inches.
For the immediate risk of flooding, the rain from Rosa may be good, because the region has suffered from a long drought.
Although the flood is very troubling, this quantity of rain is very useful in some areas because South West is facing a drought.
Weather.com reports that from U.S. drought monitors, about 40 percent of Arizona is facing serious drought problems, level two."
First, Hurricane Rosa will land at Baja Califonia's peninsula.
With Rosa still at her sunday morning strength, the peak storm at 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Panta Egnia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
That storm hit the cooler water in the Pacific, and it weakened.
So it's expected to land at Mexico with the hot zone force on Monday afternoon or evening.
The heavy rainfall in some of Mexico's area puts a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, and possibly up to 10 inches", reports Weather.com.
Then Rosa will turn into a hot storm and cross north of Mexico before it turns into a great storm at Arzona's border on Tuesday morning and will blow through Arizona into the south of Utah in the middle of Tuesday.
"The most dangerous part of Rosa or the rest of it is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and the US South West."
These rain are supposed to cause a fatal flood, and debris floating through the desert and land in the mountainous regions.
Arrest four men who tried to kill him.
A three-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy found stabbed at the Somerset.
The wounded teenage boy was found at the Exelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday, around 0400 BST.
He was taken to the hospital while he was still in serious condition.
One 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds, and one 20-year-old man were arrested that same night in Radsock, the police at Avon and Somerset.
The authorities have asked those who have witnessed and stored the data on the phone. Please report it to the police.
Tramp said that Kavanaugh's was a humble, angry suffering of the Dimocrat Party.
"Cavaugh votes against Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the ruthless and violent strategy of the Dimocrite Party," said Tramp during his campaign on the West Virginia.
Tramp said Kavanaugh caused the Dimocrite Party to suffer evil, anger, over the entire term of his title.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress last Thursday by firmly denying the allegations of Christine Blysey Ford that he had sexually abused her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford has confirmed the charges she made against her in the statement.
The president said that on Saturday, the American people saw the intelligence, qualities, and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm for Kavanaugh was a vote to confirm that it was one of the most successful lawyers of our time, and a jury with the best public service history," he said to a group of sponsors at West Virginia.
The president mentioned that Kavanaugh was nominated when it came to the importance of the central elections for religio.
"In five weeks, the most important election in our lives,
I didn't run away, but I was running towards him. "He said.
"That's why I'm fighting for a good candidate."
Trump argues that the democrats are on a mission to resist and interfere.
The first major vote in the Senate about an offer of Kavanaugh is expected less than Friday.
Hundreds of people were killed by tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them washed off the beach when the tsunami hit Sulavese, Indonesia, on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival on Palu's beach on Friday, when the waves were six meters high, washed ashore at nightfall, and destroyed a lot of people.
Seven-and-a-five-year-old earthquake after tsunami.
"In the wake of yesterday, people were active on the beach, couldn't run away and be a victim," said Sutopo Pervo Nguroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB relief organization at Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come by waves, but dragged the trailer, the trailer, and hit the land," adds Nadroho, by 800 kilometers an hour (497 miles per hour).
Some climbed up a tree to escape the tsunami and survive.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by disaster agencies show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges are distorted, and mosques are surrounded by water.
After's shock is still shaking the coast town on Saturday.
After several earthquakes, it can be felt in 2.4 million areas.
The International Institute for Evaluation and U.S. Technology stated in a statement that the energy released from the Great earthquake on Friday was about 200 times as powerful as the atomic bomb that Hiroshi had on World War II.
Geography of a town at the end of a small bay may not cause a tsunami to grow.
Nagroho explained the damage to the environment and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls, and hotels have collapsed.
Some of the victims were found under the debris of the collapsed building, and he added, and 540 were injured and 29 were lost.
Nguroho said that the number of deaths and damages could have increased along the coast by 300 kilometers (90 miles) north of Palu, which is an area called Dongala, which is near the center of the earthquake.
"All missing and no data," said Dongla, Ngroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross in an additional statement that officials and volunteers are headed for an affected area.
"This is a tragedy, but it could get worse."
There was a broad review of the agency on Saturday that there was no report of a tsunami coming ashore at Palu, although the authorities said that the wave came within the time of the warning.
In the amateur video shared on social media, you can hear a noise from a man at the top of a tsunami building that is approaching people on the streets below.
Within a few minutes, the water wall hit shore and swept into buildings and cars.
Reuther News won't be able to monitor it immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a massive blackout and caused the communication around Palu to be cut off, so it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue.
The military began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but refugees still needed food and other basic needs.
Only city airports have been opened to support relief, but they will remain closed for commercial services until October.
President Joko Wido is scheduled to visit the refugee center in Palu on Sunday.
The number of damages caused by Indonesia's tsunami has reached 800.
It's a terrible thing.
While Agents World Vision traveled from Dongla to the city of Palu, where the employees were temporary residents of a tarp installed in front of their offices safely, they had passed the crime scene that had been destroyed all the way to Mr. Dosba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destruction," he said.
It was horrible.
Although the aid group is going to move forward strong and serious relief, some people are going to conclude that special international aid workers are still prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesia's law, aid funds, equipment and foreign officials can only enter the area when the disaster scene is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a province disaster only," said Alicia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," then we open up for foreign help, but we're not in that position yet."
The second night after the earthquake and the tsunami hit Palu on Friday, friends and family of the missing were still hoping for a miracle.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
Sunday, a rescue team rescued a young woman from the rubble she was stuck with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono Kosh, an Indonesian parasol team that was trained by an ancient player, recently ended earlier this month in Indonesia and disappeared.
Mr. Mungi adds that the others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel are also his students.
"As a senior in a skier line, I feel terrible," he said.
Mr. Gendon once again told me that after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel crash was passed down in a social group of parasaptists, he tried to send a message to the competitors at Palu, who were celebrating on the beach.
Either way, his message only appears to be gray, not two blue ones.
"That means the message can't reach them," he said.
A thief robbed $26,50 of an ATM at Lavee, Newport.
On Friday morning, a band of thieves robbed a bank of $26,700 from a Bink agent while filling an ATM at Newport on the level, according to the Newport Police Department.
Drivers have cleared the ATM in this eastern complex and are prepared to add more money to it.
While he was busy, there was this other guy who was running from behind Bink's employees and stealing a bag of money that was prepared to be put in the closet.
According to the news, there were several possible suspects at the scene, but the police didn't profile any suspects involved in the incident.
If anyone has any more information on these individuals, please contact the Newport police station at 859-292380.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye.
rapper Kanye West changed his name to ya.
This change was announced on Twitter on Saturday, and he wrote: "It is officially known as the Kanye West."
West 41 has been nicknamed Y for a while, and has been using that name in the eighth album that was released in June of last June.
This change was made before he showed up at the Sunday Night Live where he was going to announce his newYandhi album.
He's acting in behalf of the Arizona Grende singer who canceled the performance due to "the emotional cause," said the manager.
In addition to the initiality of his current name in the field, West said it meant a major religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'yes' is a word used a lot in the Bible, and in the Bible, it means 'u'. West said early this year, while talking about his album name with the Big Boy radio manager.
"So I'm you. I'm us. This is all us.
Start with Kanye, which means that the one and only Y is a reflection of the good, the bad, the confusion, everything that we are.
This album is about reflecting who we are."
He's one of the many rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was once known as Puff Daddy, P.D.Deddy, but this year there's a announcement he's most fond of: Love and Brother Love.
One of West's co-workers, JAY-Z, has written both either with or without letters and capital letters.
Mexico's MILO vowed not to use troops in the battle against civilians.
Andres Manuel Loebz Obrador, who was elected president but has not yet taken the position of Mexico, vowed not to use troops against civilians because the country is entering the 50th anniversary of the bloody incident with students.
Loebz Orrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelloco Plaza that "no military force will use the Mexican people to bring them down."
The bombing forces shot at a peaceful protest at the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing over 300 people at the time when the movement of left-wing students spread across Latin America.
Loebz Obrador swore that he would support the young Mexicans who study for the course by giving their monthly subsidies and will also open a university of non-refunded state.
He also said that lack of employment and lack of educational opportunities has turned young people into mobs.
The United States should give A.I. double.
Because China is so enthusiastic about artificial intelligence, the United States should support twice as much research on this side as Kai-Fu Lee, the AI investors and workers who used to work for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
This idea occurred after all parts of the U.S. government had announced the AI without a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China launched a plan last year with China's goal to be the first in innovation on AI by 2030.
"Stretch up the AI research budget will be a good start, keeping the countries behind the U.S. behind them, and we expect to see great developments in AI," says Lee.
Double the funding can double the odds that the U.S. will succeed in the AI next great, Lee speaking to CNBC in this week's interview.
Lee, the owner of "AI Superpowers: Siena, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the Houghton Minin Harourt Publish, a CEO of the CINO VENZ, who has invested in one of the famous companies about I in China Face+.
In 1980, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he tried to win the AI system that won the highest player on American Otlo, and then he was the director of the Microsoft Research Department and president of the Chinese Department.
Lee, thank you for the technological competition held by the previous governments, such as the Defence Adves Research Projects Agents' Robotics Challe, and ask when they're going to be again so that they can continue to consider the vision.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to make money for Lee government.
"It's not China that's going to pull away the educators, it's the companies," says Lee.
Now, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired university scholars to work on the AI.
Lee says that changing policy of immigrants may be able to help support the United States in the development of AI.
"I think a green card should be released automatically to Dr. AI," he added.
The China Council of State, State Council, announced the next generation of artificial intelligence development, and then in July 2017,
China's National National Science Institute has funded people in schools, just as the National Academy of Sciences and other government organizations have supported U.S. researchers, but Chinese education has lower quality than Lee.
Early in the year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an artificial intelligence center, which means that there will be several partners from the U.S. and the university districts involved, and the White House has announced the form of intelligence selection in artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced to invest $2 billion in a initiative called AI Next.
And recently, NSF has invested more than $100 million a year in research on AI.
But at the same time, the U.S. law for asking to establish a national intelligence security committee has not been making progress for a month.
The Mecedonia people go to vote to vote for a change of country.
Would the people of Mecedonia vote on Sunday to rename the country as the Republic of Northern Macedonia, this movement to solve a decade-long dispute with the Greeks, which would not allow them to join the European Union?
Grace, who also has a state called Macedonia, still wants her northern neighbors to keep the same name, to extend their rights to the boundaries and protest that they do not enter Nato and the European Union.
The two governments had a confrontation in June because of the new name presented by the Patriots, arguing that this change would undermine the Slavic race, most of the Macdonia.
President Gorge Ivanov said that he would not share in the public opinion and campaign of overthrow had created a doubt that the outcome would be at least 50 percent effective.
The voter question was: "Will you be a member of Nato, Nato, and EU by agreeing to the Grace agreement?
A change-name sponsor, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argues that it's worth a lot to Mecedonia, which is one of the countries that broke out after the collapse of Yogoslava, if it's a part of the council, like EU and NO.
"I'm here today to pronounce the future of a nation, young people in Mecedonia, so that they may live free under the shadow of the European Union, because that means a safer life for us."
Even if it's not legal commitment, there's enough congressmen to say that they'll hold to the vote.
The name can be changed. Two-thirds of Congress must be heard.
The National Election Committee said that at 1:00, there was still no reports of any disorders.
However, only 16 percent of the voters, compared to the last Congressional elections in 2016, who had 66 percent votes.
"I'm here to pronounce it because of my children, we're in Europe," said 62-year-old George Tanevski, who pronounced at the capital of Skopje.
The prime minister of Macedonia Zarvan Zarika and his son Dushko voted for a change of name in Macedonia to allow the country to join the European Union in Tramica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
The parliament at Skopje Vladimir Kavarkov, 54 years old, has arranged a small stage, and opposition to the government has set up a number of chairs in front of the tent.
"We're ready to join Nato and EU, but we'd like to join with the lift up, not by being a service station," said Kavadarkov.
"Even though we are poor countries, yet we have dignity.
If he doesn't want to pick us up by the name Mecedonia, we can still turn around like China or Russia and become part of a combination of Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev said that being a NATO member would bring an investment that was needed in Macedonia, which has over 20 percent of the unemployment rate.
"I believe most people like it because more than 80 percent of the citizens like EU and NaTO," said Zaev after dropping his vote.
He said that the result of "responsible" would be our future confirmation.
There was a poll conducted by the Mecedonia Institute of Political Research, published last Monday that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would join in their votes, which was lower than the voters wanted.
Another poll conducted by Mathma TV, Macedonia, found that 57 percent of surveyers have plans to vote on Sunday.
And 70 percent of them said they'd vote for it.
In order for this to be unanimous, the number of votes to be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of this resolution will show the loss of the first political opportunity of the government to support the West ever since its entry in May of last year.
See, Seargio Aguergo's Manchester City baby-sit through the brighton rear, and then the goal is gold.
Sergio Aguro and Raheem Turling sent the ball through the brighton rear in the Manchester City race to win 2-0 on Saturday at the Ethihad in Manchester, England.
Aguro makes the score in the 65th minute look incredibly easy.
An Argentine front-end kicker picked up a ball sent from the Central Center at the beginning of play.
He ran through the three rears of the brighton before kicking out into the open field.
Then he found himself surrounded by four green shirt players.
He turned through one of the rears before he ran faster to the edge of Brighton.
And then he ran through to the left to find Sterling.
The British player in front of the goal sent the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to kick it across the ball of brighton mathew Ryan to the right of the net.
"Aguero has some trouble with his feet," said the manager of City People's Guardola to the press.
"We're talking about his play in the 55th, 60th minute.
That's what happened.
We're very lucky that he scored in that moment."
But it's actually a Sterling that makes Sky Blues an advantage from the very beginning of the "Premier Lake" game.
The lead score is in 29 minutes.
In that game, Aguro gets the ball deep into the brighton territory.
He passed the beautiful ball to the left to Lory Sayne.
Sayne's got a baby before we put Sterling to the Far Post.
The Sky Blues, already in the front, kicks the ball into the net before they slide off the field.
City meets Hoffenheim in Champions Lake, 12:55 on Tuesday at Riin-Nekar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sherzler wants a fight with Rockies.
When Nationals withdraws, it's a good opportunity.
But Sherlock, who has always been a rival, hopes to win over the Colorado Rockies in Sundays, but still panics in the Rockies play style that wins all the game against Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
Rockies beat the Nationals with a 5-2 on Friday night, but still looking to rank their first division.
"Even though we didn't win, at least we had a glimpse of the game here at Denver with all the fans and other teams with the highest level of play I've had this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in this competition?"
Nationals hasn't announced the game starter for Sunday, but it's likely to get the Shurzers in this situation.
Sherzer is playing his 34th game this season by being the one who starts on Thursday and is back as a regular hit on Sunday.
Washington's right hand has 18-7 scores with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes, plus 220 2/3 this season.
Trump went on a campaign trip to West Virginia.
While the President was talking about the number of votes that were voted against the Reublican in the middle election, there's an allegations about what happened around Brett Kavanah, which is an option to be a very, very, very high court.
"What we did was a bet in November.
Five weeks from now, one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big things -- I'm not just running, but I'm really running around everywhere looking for the best candidate," he said.
Trump continues, "Have you ever seen a group of horrible radicals, so you can see now?
They're trying to pull their power back, no matter what the way it is, you're going to see their horrors, their ugliness.
They don't care who's hurt, who's being stepped on for power and control, they'll do anything, but we won't let them."
The democrat group was assigned "to resist and hinder" at all costs, he said.
"which you've seen in the last four days," he added, and called the democrats, "in anger, evil, hateful and honest."
He referred to a public senator, in the order of the National legislature, as Diane Finstein, who was famously criticized by the audience.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you leak the paperwork?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for one -- that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labor is no longer an open community.
If someone speaks out of their own mind, it's unacceptable.
When the motioners of my local party criticized me, it wasn't surprising.
After that, I was the last person on the list of members of the labor council who were told that we were not welcome -- all of those were people who spoke according to their own ideas.
My associate in Congress, Jon Ryan, had a similar reaction when she stood up against the Jews.
In my case, the reviewer criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremey Corby.
And to compare it to the importance of trust in national security and in Europe, it's like the problem that Jeremey had against the previous leaders.
On Friday, a notice of Nottingham East East Labour said, "We need a comprehensive and effective meeting."
For me, as a labor council member for eight years, the GC conference on Friday was exactly what it was.
Sadly, today, not the tone of many meetings and the political promise of "merciful, gentle," which has been forgotten for a long time, but in fact, it hasn't happened.
The more day it became clear that the opinions were not accepted at the labor party, and that every opinion could be decided on by the leaders.
This happened some time after Jeremey took the lead, because my associate who I thought could share a similar political picture began to expect me to turn back and take a position that I never thought I would accept - whether it was for the safety of the nation or the EU.
Whenever I'm talking, it doesn't matter what I say, it's always the way I say it is with the insults on the social media that I shouldn't be elected to the federal politics, saying that I shouldn't be in a working party.
But that's not just me.
I know I'm luckier than many of my colleagues because the comments sent me are mostly political.
I am afraid of the professional and committed efforts of these colleagues who can face the flow of sexual or racist insults every day without feeling embarrassed and discouraged.
One of the most disappointing aspects of politics today is why insults can become so common.
Jeremey Corbinn called last week to a foster party a culture of tolerance, generosity.
But the reality is that we are no longer an open community of opinion, with all the moves that are "invulnerable" or the changes of certain rules narrowing the idea of the party.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years, asking me to keep my head down, not so much, and I'm gonna "Okay."
But that's not how I got into this town.
Ever since I joined the Labor Department 32 years ago, since I was a student, there has been a spark of ignorance in the government of Thackers that caused my thinking to drop to school but turned to doing public service for the most wanted - whether to the local council or to the minister.
I've never been a politician, not even at the latest election.
No one in Nottingham East is confused about my political position and the stories I disagree with today's leaders.
All I can say for people who promote movement on Friday is that when they're plowing towards the Breexit, our business and public service must be damaged, and I don't understand why they're wasting their time and energy on my loyalty to the leaders of the Labor Party.
But there's a sentence I really want to say, but not with Nottingham Momentum, but who voted for me, whether it was a laborer or not: I'm very proud to have served you, and I promise no threat or political advantage will prevent me from doing my job, which I certainly think is best for you.

The second attempt may be a bad final attempt, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win the Tenncent Premier Chip.
Now, they're top ten. No one can take them down.
In the end, it's a great defense, including the capture of Home, and Coach Peter Murchie is smiling at his work.
"We've been tested all over the game, and we're still standing by, so I'm supposed to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose says: "The credit for Ayr, they take advantage of it better than we do."
For the Ty, in the 14th minute of Grant Anderson by delivering Frazier Climo to the Ayr, but by the fact that the captain of Scotland, Barry Hughes, was given the yellow card, made it possible for Melrose to come up with the game and make Jason Baggot possible.
Climo push Ayr up to the point before the first half, he's done with the solos, putting the tie in at 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half as well, and with Patrick Anderson's children from Baggot's delivery, it was only five points away.
Then there was a rather long pause, since Ruridh Knott was injured in his leg, and after starting a new game, Ayr opened up a quick sample of Stanford McDowall by delivering the Climo.
And then Blair McPherson's captain, Ayr's, was given a yellow leaf, and Melrose scored from Bruce Colvin's tie, ended up in a fierce game.
And when Streun Hutchinson got hit by a yellow leaf with no balls, it gave MacPherson touchdown from the penalty point, and Ayr was able to leap back.
Climo forwarded immediately upon a new game, after Kyle Rowe, received a kick from David Armslong and passed it to Gregor Henry until he had a fifth tie for the team.
The star of Stil Game turned to a new career in the restaurant industry.
Stars in Stilgame, Ford Keieran, turned to the service industry after they were found on the board of a registered restaurant company.
A 56-year-old star playing Jack Jarvis on the popular program of BBC, who wrote a playbook and joined a comet with an old partner, Grigg Hemphall.
They both announced that the nine seriess were going to be the last of the series, and it turns out that Kiran was planning his life after the Crieglang.
He's a director of the Afrifmoon Limited Corporation.
He refused to comment on this, although Scottish Sun's source implied that Kiran was considering joining the glee club's interesting restaurant business.
The sea is ours: Bolvia, there's no way out to the sea.
The Navy patrols the Navy headquarters at La Paz.
These buildings are decorated with blue, sea-spangled flags.
The Navy, which was based from Lake Titica to Amazon, was adorned with a motto: "The sea is our rightful right.
To get that right back on track."
Every part of Bolivia that can't get out to the sea is a vivid memory of the loss of the coast to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict, because it's a strong desire to sail through the Pacific Ocean again.
This may be the highest hope in the last decade, because Bolivia is waiting to be judged by the Universal Court on October 1st, after five years of meditation.
"Bulivia is moving, has a single soul, and is certainly watching the results with positive expectations," said Roberto Calzalla, a Bolivian ambassador.
All of the Bolvias set their eyes on the decision by ICJ with large screens all over the country, hoping that the Hague court would agree with the Bolivian demand that - after ten years of conversation, the Chile was forced to negotiate to allow a way to go to sea with Bolivia.
Evo Moroles, president of the very talented natives of Bolivia, who are facing next year's re-explanatory debate - there are a lot of things that need to be decided on Monday as well.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific." He swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court won't judge for Bolivia, but that could change.
The U.N. Council, based on Netherlands, has no jurisdiction over Chile's territory, and indicates that there is no possible effect of talking.
The ICJ's decision will come out six months after the final hearing, indicating that this is a "uncomplicated" case.
And to find the cause of Bolivia, far away, it might have to go back four years.
"The sea access problem is being robbed by the current Bolivian government," says the Zubrate.
The war's works of Morales undermined the rest of Chile's good intentions.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very hard to continue the discussion.
Both countries haven't traded ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzec, representative of Bolvia at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court was unusually quick.
The moon will lead Bolvia, "the special opportunity to open a new kingdom in a relationship with Chile," and the opportunity to end a mutual disagreement that has lasted 139 years, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Moreles - that was still one of the presidents of Latin America, who had the most popular people - had used the problem of sailing for political purposes.
"Bolvia will never give up access to the Pacific." he said further.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see us cross the past."
North Korea says there's no nuclear reduction until they can trust the United States.
The North Korean foreign minister, Ri Young Ho, said that his country would never reduce nuclear weapons first if they couldn't trust Washington.
Ri was said on a Saturday at the United Nations Conference:
He called the U.S. to follow the promise he made at the Sammidt Conference in Singapore.
He commented that the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to have begun to talk diplomaticly about the nuclear debate after a meeting in Singapore with Kim Jang Un in North Korea over three days ago.
Ri says it's a dream tube that carries the American guarantees and objections to the end of the Korean War will lead to the North to untrusted North.
Washington doesn't trust the end of the war until he sees Pyongyang taking the first step.
Both Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But is there a general mystery that Pyongyang will give up the armory that the country sees as the only way to ensure the safety of the country?
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyong next month to prepare a second meeting for Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show has released the latest product top hat to be placed at the main store near your house.
If you want to add a hat to your collection, or if you really want to keep the sun away, you don't have to look elsewhere.
designer Valenino and Tom Browne have uncovered a black hat for the SS19 Convict on the runway in Paris fashion week.
The unlikely hat in everyday life has collapsed instagram this summer, and these designers have sent these brilliant inventions to the catwalk.
The dot that the dot is made up of Vanentino, a broad hat, made of feathery material, funging like a lap over a model's head.
Other devices larger than usual are melon hats decorated with jewelry, wizard hats, and even pineapple hats -- but they're not designed to warm your head.
Tom Browne was also exposed to a strange set of masks, and which fits the Hallowen court.
There are a lot more colorfully sewn masks that look more like Hannibal Lecter, which is a design work that comes out of the leading coatroom.
There's one invention that looks like a dive device, and it's got these deep-diving glasses and on the surface, while the other one looks like a melting ice cream cone.
And if you keep up with this great fashion announcement, you're lucky.
Stylen observers speculate that a huge female cap will be sold at the main store near your house.
This larger hat is usually hot since 'La Bumba' we can see this two-foot straw hat from Rihanna to Emily Ratajowski.
The label behind the hat, which cannot be used in everyday life through this social media, has created another invention on the catwalk, almost as big a beach bag as a swimsuit model holds.
An orange bag made of palm trees, cut off with palm branches, and a white handle made of leather was the most prominent piece of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS 19 Collision at Paris Fashion Week.
The designer gave the famous Luke Armage to the Fly: 'I expect to see these big hats and beach bags arriving on the main road next summer - because the designer has made this huge impact, it's hard to ignore the need for greater than this.'
John Edward: language skills necessary for the citizens of the world.
Scotland's private school has a history of academic excellence and continues in 2561, with another outstanding test result that has been strengthened by the success of individuals and groups in the arts, music, and other communities.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, who represent the board of SCIS private school, are determined to give the best services to students and parents.
Private schools have a purpose in preparing students for further education and higher than the choice of careers and places of the world as citizens.
As a semester that can be designed and applied to school as needed, we see that modern language is popular and wanted within the school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone else in the language he understands, that word will go straight to his brain.
If you speak to him in his language, the words will go straight to the heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
As a result of this year's final test, we can see that language is even more important with the highest test rate in private schools.
68 percent of students who learn foreign languages get high A grades.
The data collected from the SCIS board school, 74, shows that 72 percent of students received high A grades in Mandarin, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish, also in Spanish, also in A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language education to enhance the skills children and students need in the future.
Now, language will be one of the classes, as well as STM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) courses, private schools, and so forth.
A questionnaire from the U.K. U.S. employment and skills committee in 2007 found that the problem with employers having an empty job was that 17 percent of the jobs were due to lack of language skills.
So language skills are more important to prepare students for future careers.
With the opportunity to work in more language, these skills are so important in the globalization world.
Regardless of their choice of careers, if they learn the second language, they will have many advantages in the future with this skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, it's going to give people who speak several languages an automatic advantage in their career.
According to a UGov survey of 4,000 British adults in 256, 75% couldn't speak a foreign language well enough to talk, and French is the only language spoken, and it's a two-digit number, 15 percent.
And that's why the investment in language education is so important to children today.
Being able to speak several languages, especially in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding a job.
In Scotland, each school will teach a different language.
Many schools will focus more on modern classical languages, while others will teach languages that seem to be most important to the U.K., looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what language your son is interested in, there's still a lot of languages to choose from in private school, with an expert teacher on this side.
Private schools in Scotland are determined to present a learning environment that will help prepare children and train the skills necessary for success, no matter what the future may be.
And it can't be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that language is still vital to the future of the country, so this has to be reflected in education.
And modern languages should be considered international communication skills.
Private schools will continue to present a variety of options and excellences to Scotland's youth.
I'm a baby.
John Edward, director of the Scotland Private Schools Council.
LeBron, prepare to launch with Lakers on Sunday at San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for the dawn of LeBron James and Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Lakers' coach, announced that James would start playing the opening season on Sunday with Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But there's no indication of how long he'll last.
"Of course, more than one minute and less than 48 minutes," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
Mike Trudwell, a reporter at Lakers, tweets that James may be playing at a limited time.
After practice a week early, a question was made to James about his plans for a six-game warm-up table before Lakers season.
"I don't need a pre-summer game to be ready in the real season," he said.
Trump at the West Virginia, YouTube Channel.
President Donald Trump started the campaign tonight on the West Virginia campaign.
This is the first day of five rallys of Trump next week, including stopping in an interesting place, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
For confirmation of the election to fill in the Supreme Court, Trump has a goal to raise support for mid-term elections to come, because the Republican Party is at risk of losing a seat in Congress when it's in November.
And how do you watch it online?
The Trump campaign at West Virginia starts at 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump lookup at West Virginia online via Lifestream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about the Brett Kavanaugh hearing this week, who has been nominating for the Supreme Court, who has been accused of being sexually immoral with a Senate vote that still remains unconfirmed during an investigation from the FBI for a week.
But the main goal of this campaign was to help raise the Republican platform in the next November election.
With the five campaigning goals presented by President Trump this week, the Republican volunteers and sponsors came out to protect and raise the base so that they could sit in Congress as much as before."
"The number of seats in Congress is the main target of this president's journey to several states, as it approaches the season of election," said an anonymous Trump campaign spokesman to Roy.
The campaign campaign at Wesbanco Arena tonight will have sponsors from "Ooh and Pennylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh", reports West Virginia Metro.
This Saturday will be a second visit to Trump's West Virginia in two months, which is a state where they scored over 40 percent of their votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to reinforce Patrick Morrise's campaigning candidate for the Republican Congress of West Virginia, which is named at the end of the poll.
"This is not a very good sign for Morrise, that the president has to come down to help his own base."
Ryder Cup 2018.
After three single courses, four Saturday afternoons is what Reyder Cup wants.
Each swing is a perfect concept for this sport, which is what golf players tend to believe, but not for this competition.
Now, what does the swing have to be?
"They have a six-point lead, and now they have four more, so we don't think it's too much of a rush," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the game that day.
Of course, now that Europe has the advantage, he's four points ahead and twelve shots to play.
As Spieth says, for The American, they think that they're doing well, and they're doing very well, not just the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas that have been playing around all day, and they get three out of four points.
Spieth, take it from here to Green and take the team by example.
The noise was a little loud to his round, and he had to lay low with fourol square, when both he and Thomas both used two shots.
His putts won them 15 years ago, and got everyone excited and convinced that the American team was no less than anyone.
"You always sink and worry with your own games," said Spieth.
That's what all players do.
18 holes to win.
The only players with higher scores than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Frenchco Malinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which is the history of the Ryder Cup.
A weird couple, but lovely couples from Europe got four out of four, and they didn't miss anything.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who don't pass Boke on Saturday afternoon, but they avoid Boke on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the nine-day hole.
The energy they have, and the Cheerios, believe that they can win on Sunday, is no longer able to get close to victory for Europe except Fleetwood or Malinari for this game at Le Golf National.
Especially when they're both playing at different places.
Europe's victory is still being said, even though it's not time.
Babba Watson and Webb Sympson make the game against Sergio Garcia, the four-star hero when he paired up with Alex Noren.
Boke and two shots at the hole nine, causing Spanard and Swede to stay behind.
On Sunday, everyone's gonna be determined to end the game.
It's interesting to watch four-ball and four-sum because it's a relationship between the couples, the advice they tell each other, what they don't recommend, and how they do strategy, which changes the game dramatically.
Europe has a good team play, and he's bringing the game on his last day, but in the U.S.A. session, it shows that the U.S.A. is fighting hard, especially Stateside.
Europe puts 10-6 in the Rider Cup on his last day.
Europe took advantage of the last day of Ryder Cup, after a combination of four-ball points on Saturday, and the Four-Sum game, with a score of 10-6, winning United States.
My partner, O Tommy Fleetwood and Frenchco Malinari, won Tiger Woods twice with four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn of the European team still holds the cup he lost at Hazeltine two years ago and beat the American team in the morning match on 3-1.
The U.S. has won two games, but they can't keep up with the score.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight more points from a single 12 match on Sunday to maintain the championship.
Fleetwood was the first rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Malinari held together to be called "Moliwood" after winning the game on weekends, the second to win four of the four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
They beat Woods and Patrick Reed in match fourballs, and then they beat Woods and Bryson Dechambeau, the new rookie at the Americian team, with a 5784.
Woods, who passed the two matches on Saturdays, showed up again, but today he lost 19 of the 29 games on four balls and four Sams, and they're in contact with him.
Justin Rose, a morning break from the Four Balls, came back with Henrik Stenson in Matt Foursum, and beat David Johnson and Georges Kopka with 281 points, which are first and third in the world.
Europe didn't have a way of elevating the rose petals for a cool day in the southwest of Paris today.
Three-time Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas have created a new record for the American team with two points on Saturday.
They beat Jon Rahm and Ian Polter from the Four Balls game in 2711, and they came back to win over Pulter and Rory McIlloy in Foursum with 473.
In the Ryder Cup history, only two times a team can come back and win a single race even if four points are missing, even if the Furyk side wants to keep the champ.
However, after returning to the top two of the first two days, it seems that they can't be shallowed out at Sunday games.
North Korea has declared "No Way" to disarm one side of the weapon without having to be trusted.
The Minister of State, North Korea, said that in the past Saturday, the United Nations has continued to destabilize the United States, and there is no way that the country will ever be able to disarm a single-man nuclear weapon in this situation.
Ry Young-ho, to the world's annual General Assembly, said that North Korea has determined to use the "private value measures" over the last year, such as stopping nuclear testing and missiles, taking away nuclear testing sites and refusing to expand nuclear and nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we haven't received any response from the United States," he said.
"If there's no confidence in the United States, there's no confidence in national security, and under this situation, there's no way we can disarm one side of the weapon."
While Ri filed a complaint from the North about Washington's resistance to the "relative" method for disarming nuclear weapons, which the North Koreans have gradually won to carry out, his statement seems to imply that there is no single refusal to nuclear disarmion, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a statement signed by Kim Jung Un and Donald Trump at the first Sammit meeting between the U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th when Kim promised to carry out the "nuclear arms in Korea", while Trump promised to ensure the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has officially tried to end the Korean War.
Washington also insisted on resisting the call to cancel North Korea's collapse.
"U.S. insists on the "nuclear disarmion" and increases the pressure to achieve the goal in an oppressive manner, and even protests against "Farening the End of War," says Ri.
"The idea that the overthrow will bring us down is the idea of a man who never knew about us.
The great question is, how much more will continuance build up our trust in one another?"
Ri didn't mention the plans for the Second Sammit Conference between Kim and Trump, where the U.S. leaders informed the United Nations early last week.
The Secretary of State stressed three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the case of the nuclear disarmion problem is South Korea and not the United States, nuclear disarmion in Korea would not have been suspended."
However, Ri's voice was quite different from the last year when he informed the General Assembly of the United Nations that the target of North Korea's rocket targets to the mainland of the United States was after "President Devil" Trump called Kim a "Smack Man".
In this year's conference at the U.N., Trump, which threatened to "small destruction" for North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but said that there was still much to do and that the South Korea was going to succeed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no set time for this, "If it takes two years, three years, five months -- that's fine."
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for doing this.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The forced assault measures of the Security Council must take it seriously and not cancel until we have confirmed that nuclear weapons have been completely disarmed and all."
The N.S.A. has solely supported North Korea's siege since 2006 to auction off the funds for Pyongang's nuclear and missile program.
Pompeo meets Ri outside the General Assembly of the United Nations and later says that he will visit Pyongyang in the next month to prepare for the Second Sammit Conference.
Pompeo went to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not very successful.
He left Pyongyang a month ago by saying that progress only had been condemned by North Korea as "the mob's orders" within an hour of the meeting.
North Korea has promised Moon a meeting this month that it will be taking down missiles and nuclear centers if the U.S. is given the "communization measures"
He said Kim told him that the "complete measure," which he expected, was a promise from Trump, said in Singapore, to guarantee security and carry out a good relationship with Washington.
Harvard University students take enough courses for rest.
This year's new course at Harvard University is a course where all the undergrad students sleep more to break up their expanded educational culture using caffeine as fuel for all the night owls.
Scholars have found that students at the world's number one university have no idea what it's like to talk about the basics of how to take care of yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School, and experts at Bream and Women's Hospital, designed a course that he believed was the first course in the United States.
He was inspired to start this course after talking about forced sleep that would affect learning.
'At the end of the course, a female student came to me and said: 'Why did you just tell me this now when I was in my senior year?'
She said, no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which was a great surprise to me,' he said to The Telegrave.
This course is first launched this year, where it will explain to students the importance of good sleep habits of how to improve education and sports and improve their general living.
Paul Barriira, a professor of psychology at Harvard School, and the director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce this course after the fact that students were very sleepless and very hard over the past week.
The course takes time, including work that requires interaction.
In one section, there's a room in the dorm, where when students click on cups, curtains, trainers and books are told about the effects of caffeine and light and the lack of sleep affects the athletic performance and the importance of regular bedtimes.
In other words, how can students be described as long-term sleep deprivation cause the risk of heart disease, seizures, depression and cancer?
A map in Campus with an interactive icon will help students think about their everyday life.
'We know that we can't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking,' added Professor Czesler.
The culture of pride in being a night owl is still, he says, modern technology and increasing pressure in students shows that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To make sure that you have enough sleep and good quality should be the student's 'secret weapon' in combating stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep is causing the brain to become hungry, and to be hungry all the time.
Rymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course by taking one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course helped him to be enlightened and to inspire him to push this course to the whole campus.
The next step is that they hope to be able to ask every graduate student to graduate in the same program before entering any competition system.
Professor Czeisler suggests that students should consider setting the alarm when it's time to go to bed, when it's time to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light released from electronic screens and LED lights, which are a problem in sleeping.
Menga made the goal of making a goal from a Gerrard delivery crew.
Rankers were struck by another defeat when Dolly Menga made a style from a Steven Gerrard delivery crew and was defeated by a 1-0 score at Lyveston.
On the Ibrox side, his first victory record over the past season, from Triup 4-1 in February at St. Johnsone, but a team of Gary Holt's second defeats in 18 games dropped eight points in Ladbrakes Premier.
Menga strike in seven minutes before the first half of the time, and the ringers seem to be unable to rise again.
While the ringers were at the sixth place, the livestons were shallowed up into the third and only further away from Habernian number Gold.
And there may also be additional trouble for the ringers when the board of directors, Calum Spence, has a head injury from the object that floats into the field.
Gerrard decided to change eight players, and so Ayr entered the Beltfred Cup Finals.
Meanwhile, Holt is still a livi 11 player, who's focused on the hearts and can take down every match.
Rankers may have held the ball all the time, but the Livstonstons go in the title and make the score.
They only got two minutes to score when Menga handed the baby to Scott Pittman through to Alan McGregor to do Gold, but Midfield can tag it off.
The Keaghan Jacobs' free kicks helped put him in the way of Craig Hawthorne, but his defenses, Alan Lithgow, can also tag a guard.
Rankers tried to control the game, but it seemed that their hopes were dim in the end.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a penalty in 15 minutes that he was bumping into Steven Laws, but Judge Steven Thompson refused to appeal to the Colombian.
Rankers managed only two and a half shots in the first half, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper was prevented from lassana culibaley and made Olivia Ejaria a styclist.
In the 34th minute, Livi started the offensive, and no one could resist this run.
The ringers failed again in Jacobs' defense.
Scott Arfield has no response when Declan Gallagher forwards the ball to Scott Robinson, which can contribute to the beautiful end of the game.
Gerhard Zigzak and Culibaly so that Ryan Kent could tear wings off and pass the ball to Morlos, but Kelly ran one at a time.
Anyway, Livingston was still enjoying the long game of the visitors from LittleGow and Hawthorne.
Holt may have had a final game, but McGregor had a very good Jacobs block before LittleGow ran from the corner.
Rankers turned Glenn Middleton and found the penalty when he tried to keep Jacobs, but Thompson missed again.
Almanac: Geiger Center inventor.
And here's a page from "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, the same day as this, 136 years ago, and starts counting... the date of the future physicist Johannes Willem "Hans" Geiger born in Germany.
Geiger developed a way to detect and measure radioactive values, which contained an artifact that led to a device called Geiger Center.
Geiger Center has become the lead science, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Corondago" that was shown by scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What are these devices?"
"This is Geiger County, who can be used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put earphones on, you hear the effects of radioactive atoms in minerals."
Evans: "It's like a flare!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention of his name remains to this day.
This new anti-cancer vaccine will teach the immune system how to see a bad cell.
This new cancer preventive vaccine will teach the immune system to see and destroy the cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to the cell, which is part of the treatment.
The way it's composed of separate immune cells from the patient and is being modified in the lab.
They'll be able to 'see' the proteins that are common in cancer cells, and then they'll be re-used.
This vaccine shows a satisfying outcome for many patients of cancer.
A woman was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to a cell, and as a result, her ovarian cancer was gone for over 18 months.
This approach separates the immune cells from the patient, changes them into the lab, so that they can "see" the proteins common in many cancers called HER2 and then they have re-using cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 explains the growth of various cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian, lung and colon, Professor Berzofsky.
It's a similar way to take immune cells out of patients, and "teach them how to define cancer, the goal of treating white blood cell cancer.
Kanye West left Pro-Trump Ditribe with his MAGA hat in his image.
Which is not a very good thing to do.
Kanye West was fired in the studio during the Saturday Night Live after the performance that he gave the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that he would go into politics in 2020.
After that night's third song, called Ghost Town, where he wears a Meke America Great hat, he talks wildly to the Democratic Party and insists on Trump's support.
"Many times I've talked to white people, and they say: "Why do you like Trump?
Well, if I were against discrimination, I would have moved out of the United States long ago," he said.
SNL began performing with Matt Damon, where stars Hollywood joked about the Brett Kavanah investigation of the sexual harassment charge brought against him by Christine Bowey Ford.
Even though it's not published, it's uploading short stories from West Social Media from the funny Chris Rock.
Isn't it obvious that Rock is trying to make a credit card for West?
Likewise, West had to say to the audience that he had trouble with his hat when behind the stage.
"They made fun of me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't walk out with this hat."
They made fun of me!
And then they said, "I'm in the lower position," he said, according to Washington Agency.
West said: "Do you want to see my lower position?" He said, "Put on my superman coat, because this is an indication that you can't tell me what to do.
Try love."
His words caused at least two complaints from the audience, and the SNL members were very embarrassed, and a report from the person at the scene said, "The entire studio is quiet."
West came instead of a member of the singer of Arizona Grende, who once had a boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, who died a few days ago.
West surprised many people with the song I Love it, where he dressed like a Pererier bottle.
West has been supported by the TEDUSA head of conservative society, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for standing next to MOB."
But the host of the Karen Hunter Showcase tweeted that West was "shown Him And Perfect."
"But I choose not to praise someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art"), who I believe has an ideal for harming my community.
He was free to do that.
Like us," she added.
Before the show, rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, and he was "Kanye West."
He wasn't the first artist to change his name and run along with Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and PDDD.
Friends of rapper Snoop Dogg used to be called Snoop Lion, and, of course, the legendary song owner Prince had his name changed to a symbol and an artist who was known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the actor from Game of Thrones, has been very fond of it.
Kit Harington is well-known for his swing of sword by playing Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, which is a mid-HBO fantasis series.
But 31-year-old actors published about the role of heroes, saying that the role on the screen is a message to young people who often feel that they have the courage to be respected.
Kit said to the Sunday Times Culture that he believed that there was something wrong and asked how to handle the problem that was so popular in the age of #Metoo.
Kit, now married a 31-year-old Rose Lessirie, an actor named Game of Thrones, admitted that he felt that he had to present the problem 'exactly'.
'I feel personally, and I'm serious about where we've made a mistake about manhood,' he said.
'What should we teach men when they grow up in the problems we face today?'
Kit believes the television media is responsible for the passion of this bold character.
He continued: 'What's born and what's planted.
What's planted on TV and on the street makes young men feel that they have to have the strength to grow up.
I think this is an important question for all of us, how can we change our passion?
Because, obviously, there's something wrong with a teenage boy.'
In his interview, he also admitted that he would no longer do the Game of Thrones in the section when this series was over in the summer, and he said, "That's enough for the battlefield and the horses."
Since November, Kitt will be shown in the next episode of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who was a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought meeting his wife Rose was the best he could get from Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on this list, so this way it made me meet my family in the future, and my life from now on,' he said.
Rose, in the role of Ygitte in love with Jon Snow, the character that Kitt showed, in the winning Fantasy series, Emmy.
This couple got married in June 2018 on the Lesie estate in Scotland.
HIV/AlDl: China reports 14% of new cases have increased.
China reports 14 percent more people with HlV and HlV.
More than 820,000 patients are in town.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter, 2018.
Most new patients have been infected through sex, as a change from the past.
In the past, HlV had been spread through infected blood in some parts of China.
But the number of patients with HlV in this way has reduced to almost zero, and the Chinese health officials say at the Yoon Nan County conference.
However, each year the number of HIV and HlV cases in China increases by 100,000.
The spread of HlV through sex is a major problem among the LGBT people in China.
Homosexuality was no longer a crime in China in 1997, but it was still a choice to treat LGBTs.
Because national conservative values have been studied and found 70 to 90 percent of men having sex with women.
The spread of these diseases comes from inappropriate protection in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has made a universal commitment to participate in the use of HlV, which is part of the solution effort.
Maxine Waters rejected the charges that the staff gave him about Senator GOP exposing about 'deception' and 'continction'.
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters has given a rejection of her staff, having posted information about three Republican senators in the Wikipedia page of law enforcement last Saturday.
The Democrat Los Angeles party said this charge was investigated by experts and websites.
"They're all lies," said Waters on Twitter.
The releases consists of home addresses and phone numbers of Utahrey Graham, from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hotch from Utah.
There was an online display of information on Thursday, posted by an anonymous party from Capital Hill during the hearing of the Senate on the sexual misconduct charges against those appointed by Brett Kavanaugh court.
This leak was posted after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
conservative sites such as Gettway Pundit and RedState report that IP addresses the source of the post are connected to Waters' office and releases information on the staff of Waters, reported by Hill.
"This false accusation is absolutely false, and, of course, this is a lie," continued Waters.
"My staff, with personal information and security systems, was affected by false accusations and lies, has no responsibility for any leak of this information.
This false accusation is certainly false, and it is a lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including former Secretary of the White House News, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial represents anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This shows that you don't have a good emotional maturity for being a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something that they didn't do, don't get angry.
They don't have to respond.
They don't need to be interested in the accused's motives.
They must be calm and sober."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh, a member of the Democratic Party, who was accused of showing too much anger during the investigation last Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a Republican party member, has also seen Waters in the mid-sea elections, shows his mind on Twitter.
"Valuable, but true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned: "The proper authorities and law enforcement authorities of these claims are corrupt.
"We will do whatever it takes to expose the perpetrators," she said, "and they will be held legally responsible for all of their actions against every member of my team."
Review Johnny English Strikes Again - Checked by Ryan Atkinson
Now it's natural to look at any new Brixit's significance in any new film that expresses British bias and seems to have nothing to do with the restoration of the act of the comicist Johnny English, which began back in 2003 at Johnny English and the team back in 2011 with the return of Johnny English.
What are the chances of a new export?
Either way, Johnny English, who has a funny ability to face the problem of a second contract, his name becomes a symbol of a wide range of cartoonists designed for a country that does not speak English.
Of course, he's a crazy spy who, despite all his weird pretends, smells like a Klorgau, the Mr. Bean face-to-face humor and the melody of the Charles of Fire in London in 2012 for the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
He's also based on the personality of the world traveler Atkinson, who, at the time of the Barcaycard TV commercial, has now been able to look at.
With a good atmosphere in the latest JE body.
I like Johnny English when I'm getting on a helicopter and wearing a vest, and there's a fan on his helmet.
Atkinson has a talent for comedy, but it doesn't have a lot of sense of humor, especially for movies like 007 and Mission Imsibble, which now has a line of humor.
A sense of humor is a child's form, and for me, the adventures of Johnny English are less creative and more focused on quiet jokes in Atkinson movies and Bean style.
The subject that's often talked about now is that the United Kingdom is getting into serious trouble.
Cyber hackers have infiltrated the U.K.'s top-secret spy network by revealing the identity of all agents in the U.K. to destroy the active agent, which is a sad role for Kevin Eldon.
The last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a voluptuous and combative man, is facing an uninformed political collapse: emma Thompson plays the part "quisi-Terea-Mey," but there's no big role in the script.
Her secret service consultant let her know that when she exposes every active spy, she'll have to send them out of the country.
And that means that Johnny English, who is currently employed as a principal in an establishment, but there's also an interference on how a spy works: there's a funny insertion, because English offers a rock spy school.
English has returned to Whitehall to hear an emergency briefing and to meet again with his partner by the role of Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married young man who played the role of a submarine commander first, and has a funny personality, which is not very good at getting Vicki Pepper to take this part.
For batman and robin, guilty of the queen's protection, retake the throne, take the role of Olga Kurylenko by a beautiful Olivia Bullettova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger under the spell of a talented billionaire claiming he can solve Britai's computer problem: Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started with a joke: disguise as waiters in a French restaurant, they created chaos in the luxury yacht smuggling missions of Volta and English, who tried to use Virtual Revolutions to familiarize the home of Volta.
There's a very good collection of stories, but it's still funny and fun, and it's perfect for children's TV shows.

And like other movies of Johnny English, can't I help but think that the British movie industry won't let Ryan Atkinson play a role worthy of his ability?
The labors department rejected the Britons' plans to work four days a week, but paid five days' wages.
Jeremey Corby's labors department had considered the plan, which would show that Brytons worked only four days a week, but would have been paid for five days.
So, it is reported that the labor force wants the company's boss to say hello to the artificial intelligence workers by adding a special holiday to them.
As you can see, the staff enjoyed a three-day weekend, but still received the same wages.
Sources say that this idea fits with the economy and increases the interest of the employees.
Turning to work four days a week was approved by the Trade Council and helping employees benefit from this change.
Senior Labor Sources spoke to The Sunday Times: ' Expected to announce a review of policy before the end of the year.
'This change will not happen overnight, but the work of just four days a week corresponds to a party's approach to economic balance for workers, including the overall industrial strategy of the party.'
The Labor Department will not be the first to approve this idea, but along with the Green Party, who is required to work four days a week during a general campaign in 2017.
However, there is still no guarantee of labor.
'Four days a week's work is not party policy, and the party will not be imported.'
The prime minister, John McDonnwell, used the last week's labor conference to determine his vision for the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnelle said that he intended to withdraw his power from the 'President' and the 'Pressor' for public health companies.
The minister of the Shadow has planned, but the current shareholders in the company may not be paid more, since the labors department may have been misappropriated.
He also confirmed that there was going to be a company worker on the board and that it would be building Inclusive Owens Funds to give 10 percent of their private shares to employees up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said to "60 Minites" that the FBI investigations for Kavanaugh may have changed their minds.
The FBI's investigations have been postponed about the case of Judge Bridget Brett Kavanaugh, at least a week away, and whether the discovery of the office affects the Republican senator.
In a Sunday interview, "60 minutes," Scott Peley asked the Republican senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whatever the FBI might be under, to change the decision.
It seems that Kennedy was more open than his colleagues from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kenny.
"I said I was on my way to attend the investigation, I said, and I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this news, along with the question, "Do you do it or not?"
He's positive, determined."
However, the votes of Graham will be recorded quite a long time.
"I've decided about Brett Kavanaugh and will be severely punished," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I do know: Brettt completely rejected," said Graham, referring to Christine Bawd.
"and all the names that she could not confirm.
36 years old.
I see no new change."
What is Global Sitizen President, and how does it relate to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York is hosting the Global City Music Fair, which is a musical event performed by famous stars, as well as an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the World Civil Rights Festival, where tens of thousands of people gathered at the large central park lawn, not only enjoyed performing such acts as Janet Jackson, Cardi, and Shawn Menses, but also the realization that this is the true goal of this activity, which was to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Globalitizen President in 2012 was an additional program of Global Overty, an international sponsor who hoped to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting poverty.
To get free tickets for the task (if you want to pay the VIP), the attendees will have to complete the mission or "actions," such as volunteering to write e-mails to world leaders, call or perform any other method that will help them increase their awareness of the goal of end-up poverty.
But how successful has Global Sitizen been to achieve its goal in the next 12 years?
The idea of winning tickets to free concerts is just a way to convince people to run, or another way to call it "clickivism," which makes people feel that they're making a real difference by sending an online message or tweeting.
Global Citizen says that since 2011, more than 19 million "operations" from the sponsors have been recorded, pushing them to create different targets.
These activities stimulate global leaders to declare a commitment and policy worth more than 37 billion dollars, which can save two billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, a group claimed 390 commitments and announcements from a group that had at least 10 billion U.S. dollars.
By a group of fund assessments that have an effect on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important bonds are The Power of Nutrition, a group of U.K. investors, who are determined to "help children grow up with full potential" by promising to give RWANDA 35 million dollars to help put an end to poverty in many cities after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the Global Citizens.
"With the support of the U.K. government, donors, U.K. government, and Global Citizens, like you, we can make malnutrition, which is social injustice, into history."
The group also said that after more than 5,000 activity calls to the U.K., for mothers and children, the government announced a fund-raiser for Power of Fear, which would support five million women and children.
The answer to one of the more frequent questions on the website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Cotizen replied: "This is going to be a long and hard journey, sometimes we could fall and fail.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-racial movements that happened before, we will succeed because we are more powerful when we gather.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Menes, Cardi B, Janelle Monau, was one of the performances held this year in New York by Deborah-Lee Burns and Houghman.
America can use the Navy's "community" to hinder Russia's export of power.
Washington's inspector quoted Ryan Zinke as saying that if necessary, Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian power from hitting markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke legally referred to a Russian Syrian meeting-- as an act of government invitation-- as an excuse to explore a new energy market.
"I believe that's why they're in the Middle East, because they want to represent the energy difference that they do in Eastern Europe, which is the belly of southern Europe," he said on the news.
And, by the way, there's a solution.
With our Navy, the United States has that ability to ensure the open sea channel and to close the way if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go out to the market," he said.
Zinke is referring to the event attendees held by Consumer Energy Allen, who are a non-income group, who make themselves look like the "The Voice of the Power Users" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran by saying that they had the same effect.
"The economic choice with Iran and Russia is to take advantage of and replace less and less fuel," he said while referring to Russia as "a single horse," with a economy dependent on fossil fuels.
This statement came up while the administration of Trump was out on a mission to encourage its export of liquid natural gas to Europe instead of Russia, which was the cheapest choice for European consumers.
As for the effect that the Trump executive, including the President of the United States Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the two "Noord Storms" pipeline program, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the Moscow "Prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Noord Storm pipeline, worth $11,000 million, is destined to double its supply capacity to turn 110,000 cubic meters into a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's severe objections are simply driven by economic reasons and an example of an unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be used as pressure tools and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," said Alexander Novak, Russian minister of energy after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary of Power in Moscow in September.
The U.S. response caused a severe resonance from Germany, which confirmed the commitment of this project.
Germany's leading organization in the German industrial industry called for the United States to step away from European energy policies and the Twitts Treaty Between Berlin and Moscow.
"I've got a big problem when the Third State interferes with our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, the head of the German industry.
Elizabeth Warren will be watching closely in the presidential election in 2020, states Senator Massachusetts.
Senator Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, last Saturday, she said she'd been "spectly watched" in the running for president after the midterm.
During a meeting at the city office in Hoyak, Massachusetts, Warren, she insisted that she consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our ruined government, and that includes women on top," she said, as The Hill said.
"After November 6th, I'll keep an eye on the running for president."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the conference at the city headquarters by saying, "He's leading this county in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has spoken out in her criticism of Tramp and Brett Cavanaugh, who have been nominated as members of the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need to have an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the poll that came out on Thursday showed that most of the people in the democratic regime who supported Warren didn't think she should sign up for it in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters, "that should be in" Massachusetts, said that senators should not run at Suffolk University's political research center, Plo, Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent support the running.
Plo shows that there is a greater support for the former governor, Daryl Patrick, with 38 percent voice support for potential candidates, and 48% disagree.

Trackin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after serving in the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son was going through, what he was going through, was coming back, and I understood that the other families felt the break in PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers had received."
"They came back a little different, they came back stronger, they came back, and they were curious about what their fellow soldiers and fellow pilots and other members of the army had given to the country."

18 different states in Colombia challenge new refugee policy.
Eighteen states and Colombia's districts are promoting a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of refusing asylum to victims who fled from gangs or domestic violence.
The delegates from 18 states and districts filed a statement from a friend of the court on Friday in Washington to support the challenge of refugee policy, reported by the NBC News.
The full name of the suitor in the Grace V case was filed against a federally unrecognizable federal policy.
She said that her partner "and the son of her radical gang member" persecuted her, but the U.S. officer refused her escape request on July 20th.
She's being held in Texas.
The federal attorneys who supported Grace said that El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produced many refugees in the United States, are facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee policy reverses the refugee committee's decision in 2014 to allow non-reported refugees to escape domestic violence for asylum.
Karl Racine, columbia's attorney, in his Friday statement, that the new policy is "responsible to federal and international law for decades."
"The federal law determines the request for all asylums being judged on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and that's a violation of that principle," said a fellow judge.
Lawyers have argued that the policy of refusing immigration has damaged the U.S. economy, saying that they tend to become entrepreneurs and to feed needed workers.
The Supreme Attorney has ordered the authorities to provide asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Emigrations are available for those who leave their homeland because of the persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in certain social groups or political opinions."
The refuge places are never a solution to every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
The desperate efforts of Palu to help in Palu when their deaths doubled in the race for survivors.
For survivors, the situation is getting worse and worse.

Clean water is rare."
The villagers were found returning to their destroyed homes, searching for water-murdered objects, trying to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospital, damaged by a 7.5-mile-long earthquake, was tight.
Some of the injured include Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, who lived outside Palu's military hospital where the patients were treated in the open because of a series of violent earthquakes.
tears filled his eyes as he described the intense earthquake that made the room five stories he was in with his wife and his daughter tremble.
"There's no time to save yourself from danger.
"Haris told the AP News, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accused China of bullying and propaganda.
A week after a newspaper in Chinese used four-page advertising in the United States every day to persuade a common trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador accused Beijing of using American media to publish propaganda.
The U.S. president Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the extra payment of the China Daily in Des Moines Reegister - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere with the U.S. Congress on November 6th, the Chinese charges against the Chinese government.
Tramp's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the U.S. election is that the U.S. task force told Roysters that the campaign's new phase of the campaign was raised by Washington to push China.
While it was common for foreign governments to publish a commercial to promote Beijing and Washington, now lock up in a more violent commercial war, which made them adjust tax level to each other's imports.
The Chinese tax rate at the beginning of the trade war was designed to attack exporters in states, such as the Republican support of Trump, Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Brandt, U.S. ambassador to China, and a former Iowa governor, who exports a large shipment of agriculture to China, said that Beijing has been doing a lot of damage to farmers and American businesses.
China Branstad wrote a comment in Des Moines Register on Sunday, saying, "Now double the bullying by advertising our own free newspaper."
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of American free speech traditions and beloved free and independent media by putting out ads paid on Des Moines Register," wrote Brans Cut.
"On the contrary, in the streets of Beijing, you're going to find a limited voice, and you're not going to see a truly different opinion, maybe in China, the economy is a problem, thinking that the media is under the harsh influence of the Chinese Communist Party."
He added, "One of China's most famous newspapers has avoided the offer to publish."
Republicans debarred pre-middle female voters by breaking Cavanaugh, the analysts issued a warning.
According to the head Republican, many stand beside and protect Brett Cavanaugh, who was proposed to be a member of the Supreme Court in the face of numerous sexual assault charges, the analysts warned that they would see a particularly severe resonance from women during the central election.
And most Republicans say they want to move on with their votes.
"Grent Rither, professor of state science at Maxwell University at Seacrew University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reecher said he suspected the last minute push of Senator Jeff Fake for an investigation by the FBI that would be enough to calm the angry candidate.
"The women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it.
On Friday morning the protesters shouted, "November is coming!" as they showed in the Senate hall, while Republican, the director of the Juvenal Committee, chose to move forward by offering the name of Cavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, reported by Mick.
"Stu Rothenberg's zeal for democracy is going to go through the sky", an unsatisfying political analyst who told the news site.
"People say it's already high, that's true.
But it may also rise again, especially among women who are moved to the suburbs, and those who are able to vote for 18 to 29 years, where they don't like the president usually don't vote."
Even before Ford's public statement on her allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there would be a severe resonance if the Republican party pushed the confirmation forward.
Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to the NBC News,
"It's not just about final votes or final votes or whether Cavanaugh's being held back, it's about how the Republicans deal with her, and how they treat her."
However, the Americans seem to have been divided aside as to who to believe in the wake of Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, with a tendency toward the latter.
New polls from Yougov show that 41 percent of the responders are convinced or may believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they are convinced or may believe in Cavanaugh.
It's also that 38 percent said they thought that Cavanaugh might have lied or lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the push from Fleek, the FBI is now investigating allegations made by Ford like at least one of the other accusers.
Ford testified before the Senate Committee under oath last week that Cavanaugh assaulted her drunk at 17 years of age.
Ramrez accused the highest court members of the court to reveal his genitals to her while they were at a party at Yale University in the 1980s.
WorldWide Web inventors plan to start a new Internet fight against Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of WorldWide Web, is launching a race that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the Irupt Technology Legend is a company built by Solid Oppensorz Company of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose their storage sites and what people are allowed to access any information.
In that interview with Ex-Clozy and the Fast Company, Berner-Lee made a funny point that the intent behind Inrupt was "the world's rule."
"We must do it now," he said.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal online data source or POD.
It can contain contacts, lists to do calendars, music libraries, and personal tools and other professionals.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlik, Black and Sporpy with all available in one browser, and all at the same time.
What's special about personal online data is that it's entirely available to users, what kind of information they can access.
This company calls it "the development of personal power through information."
According to John Bruce C.E.O., the idea for Interupt is for companies to bring resources, procedures, and appropriate skills to help make Zolid available to everyone.
Now, this company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce Platform, purchased by IBM, some regular developers have signed a contract to work on projects and communities of volunteer writers.
Earlier this week, technology developers around the world could build their own separate zero app using existing tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said, and his team did not talk to "Facebooks and Google, whether to recommend a complete change, where all the business models of them would flip completely overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
One of the mediums published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote, "The mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial and ecological energy to protect the integrity and quality of new websites built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the WorldWide Web company at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the Internet debate.
Even at the time of the launch of Inrt Berners-Lee is still the founder and director of the WorldWide Web Group, the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I look at the incredible optimism for the next generation of web," added Berners-Lee.
The Church Father Victoria Cross, World War I, celebrated the first world war.
The only Church of England to defeat Victoria Cross during World War I, as a warrior, was celebrated in his homeland 100 years ago.
General General Bernard Vann won that award on September 29, 1918, in an attack at Belenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest honor in the British Army.
That rock was revealed by his two nephews at the marching event in Rusden, Northamptoncher, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his nephews, said that it was "a wonderful symbol," this rock would be revealed exactly 100 years later, since the success of his grandfather's reward.
According to London’s government announcement, in September 29, 1918, Colonel Owens led his troops across St. Quintine's Canals-Quinttine, through a thick mist and under heavy fire from cannons and heavy machine guns.
After that they made haste, and went up to the firing range, and with the word of great courage brought the course forward before them, and struck the cannons alone, and struck three companies.
Lieutenant Owen was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
"Some of the things I know I can't follow, but things are humble.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, put a bunch of crickets behind the parade led by the Royal Boyhood of Brytwood.
Michael Vann said, "It's an honor to be involved in this parade," and added, "The courage of a true hero has been shown out of the support of a lot of people."

But it's not. It's a government issue.
I promise to all of you that this will not happen next time.
We're going to keep it five feet instead of six, as we normally do, and we've been trying to deliver it to our fans, and we've just been thinking about it.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Diss.
Tom Daily, an Olympic jumper, said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his gender -- but that inspired him to succeed.
A 24-year-old man said he didn't think until he went to high school, "Not everyone's like me."
Speaking of Radio 4 Desert Island Diss, first presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had mentioned the gay right to give hope to others.
He also said that being a parent makes him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a longtime program of regulars, took months off from his illness.
It seems that being a floater on Laverne's first list, that Delie said he felt like "a little bit more," all the other people who grew up because "it's not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings that feel a little bit less and feel different are really things that give me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "the special thing," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally knew about his gender.
Two-time Olympic gold medalist has become the LGBT campaigner that people are watching and have used his appearance in this year's Australian state game to attract more countries to reduce homosexuality to crime.
He said he'd come out loud because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without a barrier and wanted to give hope to others.
Three world champions said that to fall in love with a man - a movie maker - a man who had met in 2013 - "I must be surprised."
Daley was married to an Oscar winner 20 years older than he was last year, but he said that age differences were never a problem.
"When you've been through so much since you were young," -- he went to the Olympics at 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it's hard to find people who have experienced the same age everywhere.
This couple became a parent in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said, "All of his attitudes are different."
"If you ever ask me last year, it's all about "I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know what? There's something bigger than Olympic gold.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named Robert, whose father died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had a ticket to London in 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him, 'I won't be able to sit in the front row," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing, and until he actually stopped breathing, and he died at last, I admit that the father was not invincible," he said.
A year later, Daley entered the 2012 Olympics and won the gold medal.
"I've just realized that this is what I've dreamed of my whole life to swim in front of a crowd from my hometown in the Olympic Games, and there's no greater feeling." he said.
It also inspired his choice of his first song--proud by Heather Small -- which echoed with him in the formation of the Olympics, and still gives him horror.

Michaelson's model is sitting in Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Michaelson, an American, will do a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th mash Rider, but he's gonna have to flip his form back to avoid it becoming a major tragedy.
Michaelson played a two-year event, twelve-time record, held on a bench by Jim Furyk, captain of the team, for Fourballs and Forums on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, as he often was to the United States, these five major winners divided his day between being a cheerleader and playing his game in the arena, hoping to solve what made him miss.
Even at the top of his career, 48 years old was not the ideal age for Le Golf National Course, where the long and fulfilling path had defeated many of the wayward children.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Michaelson in Matsch 9 on Sunday confronted Fresco Malinari, the precise British Open champion who joined the new Tommy Fleetwood recruit to wipe out the four matchmen in the week.
If the Americans are four points below the beginning of the 12 match solos, the hot start of Michaelson's match could be very important.
Furyk shows confidence in his people, it's not like he can say a lot of other things.
"He fully understands his role today, pat gently on my back and put his arm on me, and say he'll be ready tomorrow," said the Furyk.
"he was very confident of himself.
He's a highly respected man, and he's committed a lot of these teams in the past, and this week, he's going to be the best in the world.
Maybe I didn't picture him playing two match.
I imagine more than that, but that's the way it works, and that's the way we think we have to do it.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
Michaelson's gonna break Nick Faldo's record for one of the most Sunday matches on the Match Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a career, Ryder Cup, that never matches the height of his personal record.
Michaelson won 18 times, lost 20 times, and then seven and a half times, but Furk said his identity brought something difficult to explain to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's smart, he likes to play with people, and he's great to be with in the team room," he explains.
"I think young players enjoy him, too, this week, which is fun to see.
He gave me more than just playing."
Captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn knows that the score we lead on may soon be lost.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knew from experience that entering the last solo game in Ryder Cup with enough leads can easily change the sick.
The Dane launched at the 1997 Valderra, whose captain, whose side was by Saberos, had five advantages over the American team, but only through the barely cut nose line, won 14122 - 13122.
"You always remind yourself that we're very much ahead of Valderra, we're ahead of the Brooklyn where we lost, and that Valderama where we won, but only near," said Bjorn, after viewing the class of 2013, 5-3, on Friday and yesterday, to take the 10-6 Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
You'll be completely bored tomorrow.
Get out there and do the right thing.
This won't end until you score on the board.
We have one goal, and that's trying to win this prize, and that's where we need to focus.
I've been talking all along, and I've been focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're aware of what's on the other side -- the greatest players in the world."
With the pleasure of his player working on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I will do nothing more than myself in this.
Tomorrow will be another fierce animal.
Tomorrow is the only show to step forward, and that's a different thing to do.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there one at a time, you're going to be fully tested as a golfer.
That's the message you want to send to the player, which is to pull yourself out tomorrow as best you can.
Now, you must leave your partner behind, and he must go and do his best as well."
On the contrary, Bjorn, opposite Jim Furyk, will make sure that his players do their job better in person as partners, except for Jordan Spears and Justin Thomas, who holds three in four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of the final flip, as part of the team that won in Brooklyn, before the defeat, when Europe completed the "Medina miracle."
"I remember every word," he said in answer when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw led his players to their last days.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to go to that fast start as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that momentum started pouring in one way, it put a lot of pressure on those middle Matts.
We line up our order and bring them out in a way that we feel is, you know, trying to make some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead and confront Rory McIlloy in the top match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Raam, Tommy Fleetwood, and other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I agree with these guys in this order because I think they've covered everything," said Bjorn, choosing a single player.
Germany's new battleship has been postponed again.
The new German Navy's new central battleship should be tested for the first time in 2014 to replace the Cold War warships, but it won't be there until the next year at least because of a system with a mistake and cost, reports the local media.
The first trial of the "Rineland-Palatinet" ship, a mid-size ship, a brand new Bajan-Vertamberg, was moved out until the first half of the 2019, in the newspaper Die Zeit, to refer to the D.O.D.
This ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problem after delivering the problem was devastating to the destiny of the ambitious project.
Four of the ships that the Navy ordered back in 2007 will be replaced by a mid-size vessel, the old-fashioned Bree.
It is understood that they are equipped with a powerful cannon set of anti-airship and anti-ship missiles, including some invisible technology, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic dropping.
Other important qualities, including longer maintenance periods, should be able to release a new mid-size ship for two years from its main harbor.
However, a series of delays means that the battleships that are today's advanced technology, which are said to cause the power of Germany to shine abroad, will be obsolete by the time it's been stationed, says Die Zeit.
A mid-F125 battleship where fate played a joke last year, when the German Navy officially refused to run the ship and return it to its shipyard in the Humburgs.
This is the first time the Navy sent a ship back to the crew after delivery.
I don't know much about behind the return, but the German media cites a lot of the number of "problems in software and hardware" things that make ships useless if launched into battle missions.
The software error is vital because the Bajan-Weirt Timbergs is being run by over 120 crews - only half of the men in the mid-size battleships, and Brad is ignoring it.
And yet, it appears that the ship is heavily overweight, which reduces efficiency and restricts the Navy's ability to improve future upgrades.
7,000 tons of "Rineland-Palatinet" was believed to have twice the weight of the same ship used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to disabled hardware, the price tag of the entire project, including training the crew, is becoming a problem as well.
It's said to rise to 3.1 billion euros.
The problem with the latest midship battleship became important when it warned recently that Germany's marine power is shrinking.
Early in the Hans-Pier Bartels year, the head of the Defense Committee of the Germany Congress admitted that the real Navy had actually "started to have no ships that could be launched."
The authorities say that the problem is over in time because the old ship was discharged, but there is no new vessel to replace it.
He regretted that there was no mid-level battleship Bajan-Vurt Timberg could fit in with the Navy.
The National Guard listening to the secret lives of bats.
The new research was being carried on the high ground of Scott's high purpose was to reveal how bats used terrain to hunt.
It is hoped that this discovery will lead to a new understanding of the behavior of this unique flying mammal and to guide future conservation activities.
Studies by scientists at the National Protection Organization for Scotland will follow all the Soprano bats and mouse bats, including brown ear bats and Dubenton bats, at the Inverwee Park in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key points all over the area to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS agents and volunteers will perform a mobile survey using cell phone detectors.
An analysis of the sound with the help of all the records will seek the frequency of the sound of bats, and which species are doing what?
Maps and housing reports will be created to create landscape ratios in detail of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that this outcome will reveal which habitat is most important to this bat and is used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of housing management, such as pasture and the best way to maintain the forest for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the U.K. have dropped dramatically over the last century.
They are under the threat of construction and development that has affected housing and loss of housing.
Winds and lights can be risky, as can sticky paper catch bugs and some chemical construction therapy, as well as attacks by pet cats.
A real bat is not blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching their victims.
They use complex echoing techniques to locate insects and obstacles precisely on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 Hegtar areas around the country, is very serious about bats.
There are ten trained experts who conduct regular surveys of housing and assistance at times.
The organization also established the first and only bat reservation of Scotland at the Great Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight species of Scotland's eight species.
David Thompson, the local manager, said that this land is an ideal space for them.
"At Threve here, we have a wonderful space for the bats," he said.
"We have an old building, a lot of old trees, and a whole lot of good housing.
But there's a lot of bat stories that we don't know about, so the work we do here and other land will help us understand more about what they want to grow up and give birth to their grandchildren."
He stressed the importance of checking bats before doing landkeeping because of the destruction of one breeding habitat, and not only one could kill 400 females and young children, which could wipe out the entire local population.
The bats are protected and illegal to kill, disturb, or disturb them, or destroy their homes.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scotsman of the Bat Protection Organization, encouraged the public to join in.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for our species, we don't know how their population is doing."
Ronaldo rejected rape charges while the lawyer was ready to sue a German magazine.
Christiano Ronaldo labeled the rape charge against him as "false news," saying that people want to promote themselves by his name.
His lawyer was ready to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the accusation.
The front line of Portuguese and Uventus was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Myrka in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He's accused of paying her $335,000 to keep the incident a secret, Der Spiegel reporting on Friday.
Renaldo, 33 years old, reported on a live video report on 142 million followers, hours after the call was reported, and threw the report, saying, "False News."
"No, no, no, no, no.
"The winner of the Baindoor says five times in front of the camera,
"They want to promote themselves by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm all happy and good," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the accusation, which they've called "an unacceptable report in a questionable privacy area," according to roysters.
Christian Schartz, a lawyer, said that an athlete would ask compensation for "the moral damage in the amount consistent with the weight of such abuses, which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last few years."
The alleged incident was mentioned in June 2009 at the hotel suite at Palms and the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the Rohaldo Club, and Myrka, were reported in an athlete's room where he was accused of rapeing her on an anal basis, according to a document issued at the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Myrka claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her that he's "99 percent" as "good guy" by missing one percent.
The document claims that Ronaldo insisted that they had sex, but they agreed together.
Myrka also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the trauma at the hospital, but then agreed to make peace outside the court because she felt like she was afraid of interactions and was concerned about the public shame.
34-year-old says she's looking for a way to flip over because she's still shocked by the accusation.
Ronaldo was going to be joining Realmad from Manchester United during the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer was moving into Italy's Juve Giants with a 100 million Euros deal.
Brecit: The United Kingdom 'will regret forever' losing its car manufacturers.
The United Kingdom, "shall regret it forever" if you lose the world's world leader in car production after Brixit, Greg Grigg, the business secretary, says.
He added that it's a worry at Toyota UK, where he told BBC that if England leaves the European Union without a deal, it will result in a temporary stop at the factory in Burnston, near Darby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
Japanese car manufacturers say that the effects of the border delay in the Brexiet incident had no deal at all to ruin the job.
The Burnson factory, which produced the Auris and Avensis of Toyota - nearly 150,000 cars made last year, where 90% of them were shipped to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March, we'll see a stop in our factory."
The other U.K. car manufacturers took the fear of leaving the European Union without any agreement on how trade across the border would be carried out, including Honda, BMW, and from underland Rover.
For example, BMW says it's going to shut down a small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexiet.
The main concern with what car manufacturers say is the risk of supply chains in events where Brexiet doesn't have a deal.
The toyota line works primarily on "just in time" with parts coming in every 37 minutes from both the U.K. and the European Union for car production.
If the U.K. leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29th, there may be a freeze at the border, which industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It's impossible to keep more than one day's inventory from the company's Darbycher factory, and that's how it stops production.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's chess eye plan for future relations with the European Union was "repared precisely to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need to have a deal, we want to make a good deal, while I say not only will success today can be enjoyed, but for us to take this opportunity," he said to this program of BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence from not just the toyota, but from other manufacturers, is that we must be able to proceed with what is a very successful supply chain."
But long-term warnings that increased costs will reduce the plant's ability to compete and lose jobs eventually.
Peter Tullardis, who's been working at Burnston for 24 years and who's been leading the labor union at the factory, says that his members are more concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs go missing, they'll never come back.
The government spokesman said: "We push forward with a precise and reliable plan for a future relationship with the European Union."
The Tremp and Rosenstein conference may be delayed again.
Donald Trump's high-stakes conference with the assistant attorney Rod Rosenstein may be "hurled another week," as the fight has been proposed to be a member of the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanah proceedings.
Rosenstein directs the work of a special advisor, Robert Mueller, who is investigating the intervention of the Russian election, the link between the assistant Trump and Russia, and the barrier to justice possible by the president.
Whether Trump fired the attorney general's assistant, which would endanger Mueller's independence, has been pouring oil into the flames of gossip in Washington for months.
Early in the last month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein talked about putting on equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th fix.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House in the middle of a report of his resignation.
Instead of the meeting with Trump, who was then at the U.N. in New York, it was announced Thursday.
Tramp said he "likes it more than won't," fired Rosenstein, but then the meeting delayed to avoid the confrontation with the Senate board, which Cavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an investigation into the FBI for a week of calling to Cavanaugh, delaying the votes of all senators.
Trump's secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Today.
I was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, and she said: "The date for that matter is not yet determined, it could be this week, and I can see that pushing away another week is up to something else that's going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to update the media."
Some reporters will argue: Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10th.
Agent Chris Wallace is asking for a reason.
Sanders said that there was no press conference, not due to aversion, "the pursuit of interest from the audience" of the newscaster, but, even though she said: "I can't agree with the fact that they seek the attention of the audience."
Then she suggested that the direct contact between the Trump and the Media would increase.
"This president has a lot more questions and answers than any other president before him," she said by adding, without claiming: "We've looked at those numbers."
The press conference will continue, Sanders says, but if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that's a hell of a lot better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do that a lot, and you've seen that we've been doing a lot in the last few weeks, and that's going to happen in a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump gets a routine question when leaving the White House or while attending the opening or media conference with honors to visit.
A single media conference is rare.
In New York City this week, the president may have shown the cause by creating occasional and independent bizarre appearances without any regard for the rules of the press.
The health minister wrote to a European union worker in NHS Scotland about the fear of Brexiet.
The minister of health wrote a letter to a European union official working in Scotland's NHS to express his appreciation for the country and bless them as they were after the Brexiet.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scotland Congressional Congress, sent a letter with less than six months left for the U.K. to withdraw from the European Union.
The Scotland government has determined to handle the cost of applying for a status status status for the European Union who works in public service being passed over.
In her letter Mrs. Friedman wrote: "This summer, the negotiation between the British and the European Union about withdrawal has continued to lead to this unexpected decision in the fall.
But the U.K. government has begun preparing for a possible non-council situation.
I know this must be a moment of fear for all of you.
That's why I want to emphasize now how much I value the participation of every member of the staff no matter what nationality they have.
Co-workers from all over the European Union and beyond brought valuable experiences and skills that strengthened and developed health services and benefited the patients and the communities we served.
Scotland is truly your home, and we would love for you to stay here."
Christing Abercrombie, emergency surgery after a head injury.
Christing Abercrombie Linebacker, the Tigers, Tennessee, had an emergency operation after a head injury on Saturday, defeating Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Mike Organ of Tennessee, reports.
Rod Red, head coach of Tennessee, told the press that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the edge of the field and collapsed there," said Reed.
The trainers and medical personnel gave oxygen to Abercrombie at the edge of the field before taking him on the stretcher and bringing him back to the next assessment.
An officer from Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds, "There's no detail of the violence of the injury at this time," and Tennessee's trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie's senior red shirt was in his first season with Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He's got all five Tuckles on Saturday before he has to leave the game, which makes his entire season making 18 Tuckles.
Foreign buyers are collecting higher stamps when they buy property in the U.K.
Foreign buyers are collected higher stamps when they buy additional property in the U.K. with cash that will be used to help homeless people under a new tory plan.
The movement would be against the success of Corbin's drive to influence young candidates.
The stamping will be kept from the tax-free people in the U.K.
The Ministry of Collections is expected to hold up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will begin to collect stamps when they buy property in the U.K. with additional cash that will be used to help the homeless.
Such movements will be viewed as an attempt against the success of Jeremy Corbin's drive to pull the young voters' voice with a promise of better housing and a aim at those who earn a lot of money.
The stamping will be taken from ordinary people and non-tax companies in the U.K. with extra money to increase the government's edge of hard sleep.
The extra money from the current stamp staff, including the higher level, was introduced two years ago in the second house and the rent - could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Collections expects this to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of the newly built London assets were bought by non-English residents, pushing prices and making the first buyer more difficult to occupy.
The rich areas of the country -- especially the capital -- have become ghost cities, because many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was raised just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a decommission of stamps to help young people get their first home more easily.
He accused the large construction company of stealing property prices, but they didn't take advantage of it, and urged Mei to stop the Kovata in the buying house to correct the English's "Home Disgrace of Home."
Mr. Corbin has announced a series of improval reforms, including rent control and closure of "no offense."
He still wants to empower the Council to build a new house.
"Last year I said that I would devote my prime to restoring the British dream that this life should be better for each new generation."
And that means fixing our ruined housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work, and create life here.
However, it's not right to be easy for people who don't live in the U.K. as well as foreign companies to buy houses like the hardworking British residents.
For too many people in the dream of being homeowners, the humiliation of hard sleep still comes true all the time."
Jack Ross:
Jack Ross, the head of Sanderland, said that his "highest ambition" was to be the head of Scotland's administration for a time.
42-year-old Scott is enjoying the challenge of restoring the North-Est East Club, who is now sitting third in the League Day, three points away from the top.
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Meren back to Scottish Premier chips last season.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I've got the B hat, and that's it." Ross told Spartsund of BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child, and it was something special that always brought me back.
Yet that opportunity will come if I succeed in running the club."
Ross' previous managers, Dick Adforth, David Moines, Sam Alladyz, Martin O'Neenle, Roy Keen, Guz Prophet, and Paul Dicanio.
The former head of the Alola Atletic said he had no fear of following up on a name founded in a big club like this, who had previously rejected the Tabtam from Barsley and Ipswichtown.
"The success for me is now measured by 'Can I take this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, there is no doubt that it belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I might look at myself as a success here if I could get the club there."
Ross entered his management career just three years after one time as the chief assistant at the Deadbarton and the spell of 15-month training on the Asaphs.
Then he helped Aloa recover from her third floor fall and convert St. Meren from almost the winnings of the next season.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than when he's playing in his career at Clyde Harttlepool, Falkirk, St. Melanen and Hamilton Academy.
"It could be a real crossroads," he thought of taking care of Aloa.
"I truly believe that management is more appropriate for me than play.
It sounds weird, because I'm doing a pretty good job and having a good degree of happiness.
But play can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through that in terms of work stress and stress, but management feels good.
I've always wanted to run, and now that I'm doing it, it's as comfortable as I've felt on my skin my whole adult life."

Summer heat waves have added revenue to the U.K. bars, but they have increased pressure on the restaurant network.
The club and bar sales increased 2.7 percent in July, but the restaurant revenue went down 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business counselor, who collects those numbers, says: "The ongoing sunlight and the overture of the British football world means that in July, there was a pattern similar to the last June, when the pub increased 2.8 percent, except for the restaurant that was hit worse.
A 1.8 percent drop in the sale of restaurants in June just got worse in July.
The clubs and bars that highlight the drinks are the strongest with the sales numbers rising when the restaurants drop.
The food-specified pub is also as bad under the sun, even though not as much as the restaurant operator.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
The total sales of liquor clubs and running bars have increased by 6.6 percent this month, with the food declines by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst, said: "These results are still the trend we've seen since late April.
Weather and the impact of social events or sports are still the biggest factor when it comes to outside market sales.
It's no wonder that the restaurant community has to continue to struggle, even though the sales have dropped 4.8 percent over the last year, is particularly painful, adding to the stress of continuous costs.
The long summers can't happen in even worse times for the operators who focus on food and time to say whether the more medium temperatures we've experienced in August will help ease some of the demand."
The growth in clubs and restaurants and the opening of new branches is 2.7 percent in July, which reflects the slowing down of branding.
Koffer Packer checked industrial sales in the region, clubs, bars, and restaurants in the U.K., gathered and analyzed work data from 47 operations groups with over nine billion pounds of cash and an industrial standard set up.
One fifth of children have secret social media accounts that they've hidden from their parents.
One in five children - some children are 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of the fake Insta page.

Twenty percent of the students say they have a core account to show the parents.
One of five children, some 11 years old, is building online media accounts where they keep secrets from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the "insta false" account - an instagram reference to a photo sharing site.

Twenty percent of the students say they're using a clean, clean account to show the parents when there's a personal account.
A mother who happened to see her 13-year-old daughter's secret web site found that a teenager seduced others, "Seize me."

Milk pumps compare the cows and the cows to their opinions online.
The company that pumps the milk has divided it online by advertising comparing mother's breast milk to cows who are being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the first soundless pump in the world, Elvey consumer technology launched an ad inspired by a serious comedy music video to show the freedom that a new pump can offer to mothers who can express themselves.
Four real mothers dance in a cowhouse full of hay to a song full of meat: "Yes, I milked myself, but you don't see a tail," and, "In case you don't notice, these are not my boobs."
The petition continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them to babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my girls."
However, the ad that was published on the Facebook of the company has created a controversy online.
With the number of 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has been mixed with audiences, many of which say it's a disgrace to the milk industry.
"a terrible decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to conceive and birth to produce milk, except for their babies who were stolen from them within days of birth.
Elvey pumps fit into the elvie/Mother.
Another comment: "It's an understandable wound to both mothers and babies.
But yes, why not use them to advertise the milk pumps for mothers who have their babies?"
Others added: "What a unconscious ad."
Other people went out to protect the ad, and a woman admitted she thought it was a funny song.
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'll find one if I'm still breastfeeding.
Pumping really makes me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I'm assuming it's like this.
This is another genius product.
The other comment: "This is a fun commercial, focused on the mares that are often at work or in the bathroom, and feels like "a cow."
This isn't an ad that honors or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women revealed that they were all dancing with the milk pumps hidden in their bras.
The idea behind this campaign is based on discretion that many women with milk pumps say they feel like cows.
Anyway, Elvey pumps were completely silent, no strings or pipes, and they fit into the breast-feed bra, giving the girls freedom to move, to hold their babies, and even to go out in the milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and CD, where Mother comments: "Evy pumps are a revolution that deserves a bold and exciting launch.
By drawing a parallel line between a woman's expression on the stem, we want to give all its pumps and challenges prominently as a demonstration of how fun and accessible this new pump feels incredibly independent.
This isn't the first time that Elvey pumps make headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, two mothers, one of them, appeared on a catwalk to a designer, Martha Jacobowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of refugees were taken to camp with tents on the Texas border quietly.
The number of refugee children held up very high, even though each month’s crossing of borders was not quite changing, partly because of the use of harsh persuasion and policy proposed by the administration of Trump made it harder to place children with their patrons.
So tradition has it that most patrons are non-reported immigrants who are afraid of risking their own ability to stay in the country by taking over a child.
The risk went up in June when the federal authorities announced that potential patrons and other mature members of their family had to hand over their fingerprints, and that information would be shared with government immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the senior officer with the immigration and import tax testified to the U.S. Congress that it had arrested dozens of people who had applied to become a single minor.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"nearly 80 percent of the people who are patrons or members of the foster family are here illegally in this country, and most of them are criminals immigrants.
So we're still chasing after these people," said Mr. Albenz.
The authorities offered a new policy to set some children in court within a month after being held, instead of more than 60 days, the previous standard, based on the shelter workers.
Many people would show up at a video conference instead of coming by themselves asking for their legal status with the immigration judge.
Those considered inappropriate for relief will soon be banished.
If the child is still in custody, they will be more likely to be anxious or depressed, which may lead to severe disturbances or attempts to escape, according to reports from the shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system a few months ago.
Supporters say that those concerns have increased in larger places, such as Tornillo, which is a sign that a struggling child is likely to be overlooked by its size.
They added that moving the children to the tent did not have enough time to prepare emotionally or say good-bye to their friends might cause a wound in the hearts that many are experiencing.
Syria said to the United States, ‘ the troops take over ’ France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Speaking of the conference of the United Nations, Valiard Almoalm, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, also called for the return of the Syrian refugees, even though the country's wars have been in their eighth year.
Moallem, who also served as vice prime minister, said that foreign troops were illegally on Syria's soil under the excuse of fighting terrorism and that "it will be dealt with."
"They must withdraw immediately and have no conditions," he said at the meeting.
Moallem insisted that "the war on terror is nearing its end" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions of people taken out of their homes.
He said that Damascus will still "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syria's lands" by terrorist groups, and "the illegal appearance of foreigners."
The U.S. has 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mostly training and consulting with both Kurd and Arab forces against President Bashshar Alad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in a country that's broken from war.
In the case of the refugees, Moalem said that the conditions were acceptable for them to return, and he blamed some Western countries for spreading irrational fear, which moved refugees to retreat.
"We have called on international communities and humanitarian organizations to accommodate these return," he said.
"They're making it a political issue in what should be a pure humane issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no rescue for Syria until Asad and opposition to the end of the war.
A U.N. diplomat said that the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey in the establishment of the stronghold of Idlib's last major rebel group had created an opportunity to talk politically.
The Russian-Trillian agreement turned a massive attack on Syria under Russian support in the province of the three million inhabitants.
However, Moallem stressed that the agreement had a "stretch time" and was hoping that military operations would focus on the Juihads and the warriors of Alnusra linked to Al-Qaeda, who were "to be eliminated."
Stoughtad De Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes that a new meeting will be held by the new committee, which includes governments and members of opposition to draft the Constitution after the war for Syria and for the election.
Moallem set the terms for the participation of the Syrian government on that committee by saying that the jury's actions should be limited to a review of the requirements of the current Constitution and alert the intervention.
Why would Trump win the second one?

The money on the outside runs into the strongest central election race.
It's no wonder Pennsylvania's 17th place was seeing an overwhelming amount of money because of the remodeling of Congress, which puts two people in competition in the same seat.
Recently, in Pittsburgh, the newly painted suburbs have created roy for the democrat Conor Lamb - who won the chair in another region in the special spring election.
Lamb is competing with Keith Rothfus, another positional Republican, who now represents the 12th district in the old Pennsylvania area, which is heavily overlapped with the 17th.
The map was re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district had unfairly divided the election into you and the Republican Party.
A new competition in the 17th district triggered a financial campaign between the major financial groups, the DCCC and the NRC.
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March Special Election for the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania.
That seat has been occupied for over a decade by the Republican Party, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
The political experts have given the Democratic Party a little advantage.
The United States weighed El Salvador's punishment on top of China and then moved back.
The ambassador noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have accepted Beijing with a little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017, and there was a hotel in Panama until his partner drove out the Trump administration team.
The State Department has decided to call back the U.S. diplomatic mission leader from El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama for "The latest decision to no longer accept Taiwan".
There was only a trial against El Salvador, which was helped in 2017, about 140 million dollars, including drug control, development and economic support.
The punishments offered, including reducing financial help and limiting target visas, may be painful for Central America, as well as the high rate of unemployment and murder of the country.
As the next meeting progressed, the North and Central American officials moved up high-level security and economic prosperity meetings to follow similar gatherings last year, which were considered to be moving forward in an attempt to prevent immigrants from heading towards the United States.
But in the middle of September, high-ranking officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to go forward, which would stop an effective trial of El Salvador's punishment.
Vice President Mike Penz is scheduled to attend such a meeting, which is now scheduled in the middle of October as an import signal for that merger.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any message or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman to Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate explained by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal discussion of the condition of a namelessness.

The history of education.
The next pair of shoes that will fall may be a report by Robert Mueller, a special consultant on the possibility of preventing Mr. Trump's justice, which now has a lot of evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller was reported to have also turned his investigation into seeing if Mr. Trump's campaign of conspiracy with the Russians to attack our election.
If the U.S. Congress changes hand in hand, Mr. Trump will find himself responsible for it, just as he's prepared to fight again in front of voters and may eventually be a jury of his friends.
That's something that, if it's a lot to lose, and I don't mean to say that Mr. Trump's collapse is inevitable -- and what's the equivalent of him in Europe.
There is a choice that we all have to make by all of us on either side of the Atlantic, which will result in how long the struggle will last.

What would we do if Mr. Trump fired the assistant attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controlled the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water ever since this paper report was reported, and last year he told me about listening to the president and predicting he's not fit for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the accounts of the Times are incorrect.
"How do we respond if the new F.B.I. investigations of Brett Cavanaugh are incomplete or fair-- or if he confirms the Supreme Court, even if there is a reliable charge of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, shall we vote in the middle of the Congress to let Mr. Trump out to explain?

The injuries on the knees made the Grim Dorrans Central unable to appear for the first time in the season until always 2-2 with Bierreal, but he believed that the ringers could use the result as a big leap.
"It's a good one for us because Bierreal is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We took the game by believing that we might get something and get one score.
Maybe we're looking for a little too much at the end, but in general, it's a good outcome.

Although the fact that the survey attendees had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, there were only a few people who were talking to members of their own family in this matter.
About half the people in the study said that they were talking to a couple about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't do the conversation process," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance.
This is the beginning.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't tell them your wish ahead of time.
Working with your family and consultants to discuss places and ways of taking care of them, because those choices may be a key factor in setting costs.
Bring in your financial advisers: your consultants can help you think about how to handle those expenses.
The option to prepare your money for long-term care can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy to cover these expenses or insurance yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have money.

Several earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people died from the powerful earthquakes and tsunamis that Indonesia's Palu on Friday.
With the communication out, the relief officer can't get any information from Dongla's office, the area north of Palu is closer to a point above a 7.5-mile-long earthquake center.
In Palu, there were over 16,000 refugees after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala on the Sugai island:
Palu is the capital of the mid-Sulavese province, located at the end of the small bay on the west coast of the Sulavesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
This town is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and the tsunami.
Donglaa is a office that stretches over 300 kilometers to the northwest of the Sulavei island.
The office, which is smaller than the province, has a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the major economics of the central Suahua province, especially on the coast of Dongla.
Niggle mining was also important in that province, but mostly in Morowali on the opposite side of the Sulaves.
Palu and Dongla have been from tsunamis many times in the last 100 years, based on Indonesia's disaster relief agencies.
In 1938, Suna did not kill more than 200 people and destroy hundreds of homes in Dongla.
The tsunami hit Dongla in the west in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on a Pacific fire ring where earthquakes occur frequently and are constantly hit by earthquakes.
This is some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis over the years:

The federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for suspects in a terrorist attack in N.Y.C.
The federal prosecutor in New York is looking for a death penalty for Zeeullo Sipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't happened in that state for a federal crime imposed by the United States since 1953.
Zypov, 30 years old, was accused of using a home Depot rental truck to attack a bicycle route west of Manhattan, swept over a streetman and a bike rider in his path on October 30th.
In order to execute the prosecutors, the prosecutors must prove that Cypov's intent was to kill eight victims and that it was intended to cause severe physical trauma, based on the intention of pursuing the death penalty, send documents in the south of New York.
Both charges can be punishable by death, based on the court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury struck Cypov with 22 charges including eight counts of murder in aid of fraud, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime and violent and engine destruction.
The act requires a lot of planning and thinking, and the prosecutor says, by describing the way Cypov acts, as being evil, cruel, and immoral.
"Zeullo Habibulla Avivik Sipoph caused the damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego, Henrie Angeli, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lore de Cadet, Darren Drake, Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Herco Mendosa, and Alejanco" announced.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since New York's southern border for the latest execution.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two couriers, but eventually he was sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in the New York Federal Act in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of espionage in the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both of the Rosenbergs were executed by electric chairs on June 19, 1953.
Cypov, native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse for days and months after the incident, according to the court's papers.
He made a statement to the investigator that he felt good about what he did.
Sypov told the authorities that he was inspired to launch an attack after watching the Isis video, several videos on his phone, based on a lawsuit.
He also asked to show the ISS flag in his hospital room.
He didn't admit to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal rights attorneys representing Cypov, said that they were "insolently disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that the decision to find the death penalty rather than accept life's punishment without being released would only prolong the wounds of these events to everyone involved," says Patton.
Sypov's defense team asked the prosecutor not to seek death penalty.
Tory MP says the NlGEL FARAGE should be served in negotiations, Brexiet.
Nickel Farge swore that he'd moved the masses today during the Tori protest.
Former head of the YuK Free Party said that politicians must 'feel heat' from the anti-European Union' as a member of the Council of Trisa May himself has proposed that he should be responsible for the European Union's negotiations.
Peter Bones Backbecher, conservative, says the march in Bemingham, the U.K., should be out by now.
But the challenge Mrs. May faced in the reconciliation of her deeply divided team was drawn by the Reformers who joined in the protest against Brexette in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her plan to fix the Chequist in the middle of an attack from the Brecits, the Reman and the European Union.
The Allies insisted that she would push ahead in an attempt to make a deal with Brassels, even after the violent resurgence -- and force the idea against the European Union and the labor force to choose between her package and the chaos.
Mr. Bones said leaving means being rallyed out in Solihoul that he wants 'to throw Chequiers.'
He suggested that Mr. Farge be appointed a colleague and be responsible for negotiations with Brassels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now,' he said.
A member of the Wellingbough Congress said, 'I'll stand up for Brexiet, but we have to throw the Chequiers.'
He said: 'We don't fight world wars to surrender.
We want to build our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bones gave up the offer that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British had changed their minds and wanted to be the same is not true.'
Andre Jankys, the Tory Brexiets are at the march too.
‘ Chequiers aren't popular with the general public, opposition won't vote for it, it's not popular with our party, and our activists who actually crushed the streets, and we've been elected in the first place.
Please put the Checkers down and start listening'.
In her statement to Mrs. May, she added: 'The Prime Ministers kept their work when they kept their promise.'
Mr. Farge says politicians are campaigning to feel the heat if they're going to betray their decision to vote in 2016.
'Now it's a matter of trust between us -- people -- and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexiet, and we're here today to tell them, 'We won't let you get away with it by doing that.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘ I want you to make our political class, who are going to betray Brecit, feel that heat.
'We're moving the armies of the people of this country who have given us victory in Brecit, and will not rest until we become free U.K.s, independent rulers, and proud.'
Meanwhile, the Remains marched through Bermingham two hours before the convention in the middle of town.
A little bit of knowledge by the activists was sounded to Torses against the Brexiet flag after the opening of the group this weekend.
The barons of labor, Lord Adonis, mocked the conservative party for the security problems they faced when the party apps opened up.
'These are the people who tell us that they can have all the I.T.P. systems and technologies for Canada plus plus, for the non-insistent territory, for free trade, without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It's a complete joke.
Nothing good Brexiet could do," he added.
Warren's planning on running for president.
U.S.A. Elizabeth Warren, a senator, said that she'd be staring at the running president after the election in November.
Boston Globe reports that the Democratic National Party in Massachusetts spoke about her future during a conference at the city headquarters in Massachusetts, west Saturday.
Warren, president Donald Trump, is running a new election in November with a representative of the GOP George Diehl, who was president of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of the assumption that she might be dealing with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon in Holyok was her 36th meeting with the democratic people in the city hall form since the command office.
The attendees asked her if she was planning on running for president.
Warren replied, "For women to go to Washington to fix our collapsed government, and that includes women to the top."

Lewis Hamilton was on the verge of world rank after the team sent him to victory over Sebastien Fettle.
It became clear from the moment that Valteri Bottas passed the selection ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturdays when the Mercedes team would compete in most of the competitions.
From the pillars Bottas began well, and almost let Hamilton wait until he defended his position in the first two rounds, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vatthel went into the pit and let Hamilton run into the pack, which was supposed to be the final decision.
Mercedes ran one round later and fell behind Vettl, but Hamilton passed up in front of the wheel to see the Ferrari driver hesitate to let the inside remain empty after two moves to prevent the third round.
Max Verstappen started with the back row of the grid and was in the seventh place at the end of his first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he took up the lead mainly in the race, while he held his tire tight to aim to reach the quick finish and Sangikimi Rikonenen to be the fourth.
He finally entered the Pit in the 44th round, but couldn't increase his speed in eight rounds, while the Riconen took the fourth place.
It's been a hard day because Valteri has been doing great all weekend and a real gentleman who told me to come along.
The team has done a wonderful job like this to get the punch suit," said Hamilton.
That's a terrible body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Fenstein at a meeting on Saturday, insisting that she did not expose the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Cavanaugh, who was recommended as a member of the Supreme Court for sexual abuse.
Speaking in a gathering in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the statement of Ford in front of the Senator's Committee, rather than expressing what was happening in the Senate, shows that people are "slow and nasty and honest."
"One thing can happen, and the beautiful things that are happening during the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry and narrow and dishonest people," he said.
"When you look at the news and the broadcast, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Fenstein, did you release the leak?
Remember her answer... did you release the documents?
Oh, no.
I didn't let it spill."
All right, one minute.
We let it spill or not... no, we don't let it spill," he added, mocking the senator's gesture.
Fenstein sent a letter of allegations against Cavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Fenstein denied the leak from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," according to Fenstein to the Hall Committee.
"You asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it as secret as you asked."
But her rejection seemed to please the president, who commented during the Saturday night gathering: "What can I tell you?
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President suggested that the Democratic Party use these charges for their own sake.
"They're determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the narrowness, the ugliness, they don't care who's hurt, who they have to step on to gain power and control," the Medite reports the president's words.

Francois Bouchard always did for Dodee before Lukas Ludwald Nielsen made the door open, took the victory.
It was a defeat in the third league of the season for the people of Adam Keefe, who came after him to beat Dund 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.

Air traffic operators gave up their lives to make sure hundreds of people on the plane were able to escape the earthquake.
The air traffic control in Indonesia is being praised as a hero after his death to make sure that one plane carries hundreds of people out of the ground safely.
Over 800 people were killed, and many were lost after the massive tsunami last Friday that caused the tsunami.
After was still in a state of unrest, and many were trapped in the ruins of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had escaped, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunwaan Agung refused to give up his position in the tower of control which was violently swingped at the airport Muterasis Al-joo at Palau Airport.
He's at work to make sure that the batic line 6321, which was on the runway at the time, can take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died in the hospital later.
Yahanez Brait, a spokesman for Indonesia's air traffic, says that this decision could be about hundreds of lives saved by ABC News, Australia.
We're preparing a helicopter from Balicpa Par in Kalimanton to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our hearts break when we hear this," he added.
At the same time, authorities feared that the number of deaths could reach thousands with the national relief agencies said that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi, and Buong were limited.
"The number of deaths is still believed to be rising because many bodies are still beneath the ruins while there's more to be reached."
The waves up to six meters destroyed Palu, which was to bury a mass on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are bringing in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, told Sookie News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in someone's body.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets have been searched everywhere."
Jan Alland, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CN: "The Indonesia Red Cross is rushing to rescue survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could be worse."
"I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the work involved in the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia, early in the last year, was affected by an earthquake in a land wind that killed over 450 people.
Now Air New Guinea says a man went missing after the lake crash.
The airline service flight service to the Pacific Lake in Tunisia is now said to have lost a man after earlier that 47 passengers and crews left the plane safely sunk.
Air New Guinea says on the news that Saturday afternoon can't explain the male passengers.
The airline says they're working with local government, hospitals, and investigators trying to find that guy.
Such airlines did not respond to more requests about such passengers immediately, such as their age or nationality.
Local ships saved the passengers and other crews after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport in Chuuk.
The authorities said on Friday there were seven people admitted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was in critical condition.
What causes the fall and the exact order of events is not clear.
The airlines and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane had landed in a lake with a short runway.
Some witnesses think that the plane runs beyond the runway.
Bill Jannes, the American passenger, said the plane came down very low.
"That's a very good thing," says Janez.
Janez said that he and the others could break through deep, waist-high water to an emergency exit on a sinking plane.
He said the attendant on the plane panicked and yelled, and he was a little injured in the head.
The U.S. Navy said that the crew who worked nearby to improve the dock also helped with the airship to get people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
According to the flight security network, 111 people were killed in the crash of an airline registered to PNG in the last two decades, but none of the airlines involved in the airport.
The night woman's timeline was burned alive.
The lawsuit ended on a Saturday in an appeal by a man accused of burning a Mississippi girl alive in 2014.
Donald, U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, is reporting for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He concluded that he used cell phone records to combine the movements of a 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and Jessica Chambers, 19, who was 19 years old, who was the victim the night she died.
Rawlett said that he had received information from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' during his time, he said he was with Michael Sandford, his friend, the police talked to Sanford.
Sanford got on the platform on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the D.A. asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he said, "Lie because my truck is in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is Tellis. He said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Rawlett said that sometimes after the death of Chambers, Tellis had removed the text messages and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hal.
The defenses are scheduled to start closing arguments on Sunday.
Judge said he expected the trial to reach the jury later that day.

Another black guy?!
Nanny, the N.Y.'s suing couples after they're fired after the "Straight" message.
New York's nanny is suing a couple for exorcisting after receiving a text from her mother complaining that she's "A black man."
They both denied that they were racists, compared it to extortion.
Lindsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was shocked to find out that Giselle Maurice, the new child care provider, was a black man when he arrived on the first day of work in 2016.
"Don't be another black man." Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
After realizing her rudeness, Plasco-Flaxman, who "responsible" fired Miss Maurice by stating that their social nanny, an African-American, did a bad job, and she was expecting to get the Philippinesans based on New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home with Umer.
Maurice is now suing couples to compensate for the dismissal and is seeking to compensate for June 350 a day for six months, a career in the home where she works before her employment, even though there is no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do anything like that," she said to the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's a choice."
Couples suing that they're racist, that stopping Maurice's employment is a reasonable thing to do, fearing that they can't trust her after she's wronged her.
"My wife sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist. "Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you trust your son with someone you're rude to, even if it's a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
The comparison of a petition as "a extortion," Plasco said that his wife had just had a baby for two months and was in a very difficult situation.
"Are you going to hit someone like that?
That's not a very good thing," added the conductor.
While legal cases continue, public opinion courts quickly blame this couple on social media, hitting them in their behavior and logic.
Paddington Publishers are afraid that readers won't understand a talking bear.
"It's hard to pay attention to someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's ridiculous to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
Saying that her father, who had worked as a BBC photographer before being inspired to write children's book with a little toy bear, would cheer up at his work that was rejected, she added the 60th anniversary of the publication "Affliction" after his death last year.
Paddington's, who she described as "the most important member of our family," added that her father was proud of the success that finally happened.
"He's a rather quiet man, and he's not a bragper," she said.
"But since Paddington is so real to him, it's almost like you have some successful baby: you're proud of them, though it's not really your act.
I think he's looking at Paddington's success pretty much that way.
Even if it was his creativity and imagination, he'd always give credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying, and I have to say good-bye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was sent to the Nix hospital of Louis Master, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad always calls to say it's really bad, and she doesn't expect to survive," said Evan-Laperhouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad to say she was dying two minutes later, and I had to say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drug doctor gave her to keep her heart pumping, slowly slowing down and out of her system.
She had already died a while earlier, and this was when all closed down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing this was coming out.
I can't howl or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it back."
Mrs. Evan-Laperhouse, who is now regretting losing her daughter on a plane with the other passengers, has no idea what she's going through.
"No one knows," she said.
"I bent my face down, and tears fell down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on this flight I feel the overwhelming sympathy of Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves you."
The grieving woman post cards to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who lost loved ones in suicide are working to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey put a card on the Wells Bridge with inspired messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Tyler was 13 years old, son of Miss Davis when he began to experience depression and suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I do today," she said.
Miss Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, says her son is a chef with a good future, with a smile passed across each other.
"Everyone knows him because of his smile.
They always say that his smile shines in any room."
Anyway, he gave up his job before he died, when he said, "In a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the one who found his brother after he died.
Miss Davis said: "I am constantly anxious to have a knock on the effect."
Miss Davis has created a card "to let people know that there are people out there you can find and you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit there quietly. "You need to talk."
Miss Humphrey, who's been friends with Wow girl Davis for years, lost Mark, who's been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt bad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He's at the lowest point on Christmas -- when children open their gifts, he doesn't make eye contact with children or anything."
She said his death was a big wound to them, but they had to break through it:
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to stand up and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is not sure which way to go when the FBI starts investigating.
"I think that if we could really get something like what he asked -- the investigation is limited by a limited time limit in the scope -- we might bring a little harmony," said Mr. Fake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the board was broken under the strain of a heavily packed party.
Why don't you and the Republicans want to be questioned by the FBI?
Their frustration comes from a matter of timing.
The central elections are only five weeks away on November 6th - if the Republicans were expected not to do so well, they would be very weak in their efforts to get people they wanted to go to the Supreme Court in the land.
Bush picked up a phone call to Senator Senator Cavanaugh, who supported Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI does the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democratics are currently in position.
It's not clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will keep Mike Penz off duty and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea is dropping under Kim.
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un had power seven years ago, says South Korean lawgiver.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to South Korea's National Union Ministry, said that it changed its banks 1,127 times last year - relative to 2,706 times in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the more strict border control between North and China and the higher smuggling rate is a factor.
Pyeongyang has no public opinion.
Most of the defectors from the north will eventually get an offer of citizenship from South Korea.
Seoul said that more than 30,000 North Koreans were illegally crossing the border at the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them escape through China, with the longest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the DMZ, which is heavily protected between the two countries.
China is considered more illegal immigrants than refugees and forced to return to the country.
The relationship between North and South -- which, technically, is still at war -- has improved dramatically in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, leaders of both countries met in Pyeongyang to discuss, focusing on the stopping nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore when they agreed on a broad condition to enter the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister, Re Young-ho, blamed U.S. oppression on lack of progress ever since.
"without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no way we can disarm one side of the weapon first," said Mr. Ree in a speech to the General United Nations Conference in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Kavanah "The Pythonist," said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, a small council leader, called a member of the Supreme Court of Court, Brett Cavanaugh said, "Physicalist," and said that he was not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on the Saturday interview at Texas Tribune, Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman acts out like that, they'll say 'like a pie-like," Pelosi said her reaction to the Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate council on Thursday.
Cavanaugh turned down an emotional charge that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening talk, Cavanaugh was very emotional sometimes almost screaming and choking while talking about his family and high school life.
He also clearly condemned the Democratic Party on the board by demanding accusations against him as "the extraordinary and coordinated killing of characters" that were organized by angry liberals at Hillary Clinton, lost the president's election in 2016.
Pelosi says she believes that Cavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't serve the Supreme Court because it shows his prejudice against the Democratic Party.
"I think he's decapitating himself with those words, and how he beat Clinton and the Democratic Party," she said.
Pelosi wondered if she'd tried to sue Cavanaugh if he had confirmed it, and if the Democratics had a lot of votes in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only inappropriate to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh, this is currently a court of appeals judge, D.C.
Pelosi adds that as a democrat party, she was concerned about the decisions by Cavanaugh that might arise from the AAA or the Roe v. Wade case, as he was considered to be a conservative line.
In his confirmation, Cavanaugh avoided the question whether he would turn the rulings of some Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a ostentatian to go to court, and expect us to say, 'What a wonderful man!" says Pelosi.
And women need to wear it as a weapon.
It's a fair review of the many months of rage, and you can't say it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, don't you think?"
And she said, "I've been very helpful to some of the women who are executives, who say she cries when she's angry, but has developed a technique that means that when she's angry and starts to cry, she'll say to the person that she's saying, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she goes on.
And I think that's great."
Tears are allowed to be a solution to some anger because they're basically misunderstood.
One of the most sharp memories of my first work in the office, which I once found myself crying with unexplainable anger, was that I was grabbed by a woman over the age of one - a cold manager that I was always afraid of - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see you crying." She said to me.
"They don't know you're angry as wood as fire.
They think you're sad and you're happy because they beat you."
Patricia Shrioher, after that, was a congresswoman from the Colorado Democratic Party, worked with Gary Hart in his running for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested for an out-of-town marital relationship called "Monkey Business" and a bow out of the race, Miss Shrider, who felt deeply disappointed, thought she shouldn't explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It wasn't a carefully thought decision," she said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they wanted was another one.
Some people call it "Snow White" and "seven dwarfs."
Because at the end of the campaign, she was at the end of a fund-raiser, so she swore she wouldn't be in the race unless she could raise $2 million.
It's a losing fight.
She found out that some of her sponsors gave her $1,000 to a man to give her $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" She wondered.
When she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she was overwhelmed, thanks to people who would support her, the frustration with the system made it difficult to raise money and aim voters, except for representatives and people who were angry about sex abuse to choke her.
"You must think I'm having a nervous breakdown," Miss Schroeder thought of how the media responded to her.
"You would think that Kleenex was a sponsor of my organization.
I remember thinking, what were they writing on my gravestone?
"Are you crying?"
How could a trade war between the United States and China be good for Beijing?
The openings of a trade war between the United States and China are raging, and while fighting is far from over, the cracks between many countries may be useful to Beijing in the long run, says experts.
The U.S. president Donald Trump fired his first warning at the beginning of the year on China's major export tax, including steel solar cells and aluminum panels.
The most important rise is coming in this week with a new tax rate that affects 200 billion dollars of goods, thinking taxes effectively half of all goods that come into the United States from China.
Beijing's responses at one time were one of the last five to 10 percent tax taxes on 60 billion American products.
China has made a commitment to a U.S. conference, and the second largest economy in the world has not been able to blink at any moment.
The Washington government has to compromise it to reduce demand, but turning to the U.S. publicly is too embarrassing for Chinese president color.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards properly, the pressure of the U.S. Trade War can support China in the long run by reducing its dependence on the two economys.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that start economic control in both countries is very dangerous, that an approved observer has been recognized before."
Syria's 'ready' for refugees to return.
Syria said that it was ready for the return of refugees voluntarily and sought help in building a country that had been destroyed by war for more than seven years.
I'm speaking to the U.N. General Assembly, Valiard Almo allem, the foreign minister, saying that the conditions within the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure because of progress in the battle against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal health.
All the conditions are now appearing for the journey back to the country, voluntarily leaving the refugees who had to leave because of the terrorism and economic measures alone, focused on their daily lives and their way of life.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still alive in the country are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.
Almo Allem said that the government of Syria would be pleased to assist in the restoration of the country that was destroyed.
But he emphasized that there would be no help on the condition or help of the nation that supported such unrest.
Europe has won the Rider Cup in Paris.
The Europeans beat Ryder Cup in 2018, beat the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on the ground of Europe and has not beaten Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe is crowned again, while a team of Danish captains, Thomas Bjorns, scored 14.5 points they want to beat the United States.

"I don't always cry, but today I can't.
It's been a hard year.
So thank you for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have my cup back.
It's a team matter, and I'm glad I can help."
He passed the torch on to his fellow citizens, John Ram, who fell the American golf legend Tiger Woods 281 in Sunday play.
"The incredible pride I felt to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man," said 23-year-old Raam.
Woods lost his four match in France, and now there's a record of a career in Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
A strange record by one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 big shows only after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled every weekend to find fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finne, who played high-level golfers throughout the tournament.
Jim Furk, U.S. Captain, said after playing disappointingly for his team, "I'm proud of them.
There's a time this morning when we're making Europe a bit of a rush.
We're a fraction.
I admire Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players were very good.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America, and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 men, and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to accept that.
We're better played."
