Of course!
What caused Tom not to come yesterday?
Every morning I go shopping.
I can't live like that.
Are these yours?
That's it.
I'm sad.
Where is he?
Give me a day or two.
I think it's the best way to do it.
What do you think of Tom's poetry?
I'm afraid they don't get along very well.
I'm sorry. I can't go.
How lonely is this world without you?
This chair is so comfortable.
