You are a coward!
What is my room number?
I couldn’t sleep.

I paid this guitar three hundred dollars.
I was built up.
He was cool to me.
I do not want to live a life of regret because of this.

Each person has his own opinion.
I will tell him at the right time.
Will we wait for Tom here?
What we need most today is a little patience.

They snatched him out of fear.
He or she should get married.
Dogs bark.
Tom is lost.
Your chick is big.
You have to be there.
He asked me some questions.
I started lunch early in the morning.
Would everyone think that I was the one who stole the money?
Why are you so thin?
I think you have to face Tom.
Tom worked.
This cut does not sound well.
That’s it!
Again, try.
I’m going to come back right away.
Tom was disappointed.
Tom was the only person who can help me today.
