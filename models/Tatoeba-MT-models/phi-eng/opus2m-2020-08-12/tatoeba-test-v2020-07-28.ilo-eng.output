Don’t forget who you are.
Tom watched Mary leave.
Tom heard you.
The sun is beginning to rise.
He struggled to win the race.
I needed to go to the toilet.
Tom would walk.
You thought I would be angry.

Tom was a coward.
Do You Recall?
You need to be careful.
I wanted to find out my blood.
He heard.
Because it was Sunday, I woke up early in the morning.
I was not thought of well.
The public was notified in 20th October.
Tom could not think of that.
The cowards died several times before they died.
This is my son.
Tom was responsible.
Tom did secular work.
Tom could not trust Mary as much as he did.
They fought for freedom.
Go for a walk.
Tom walked.

He was caught up in unexpected obstacles.
Because of Sunday, I did not wake up early.
Would you like to hold our hand tonight?
Free Tom.
He sent a card to Mary.
The cat lives nine.
Tom must have known why Mary had left town.
Do you hate Tom very much?
I am sure Tom received the message.
Do you dare not or resist his thinking?
The blood of heroes flowed through my veins.
I cannot come.
I want to stick to him.
No one could stand in my way.
All of you seem to be busy.
Tom was not giving.
What is UFO?
Love your neighbor.
Do you need help to do this?
When did you paint your wall?
You are a smoker?
I could not solve this problem in any way.
The meaning of the words is easy to grasp.
Who owns it?
I have a cat and a dog, and the dog is black and white.
I was forced to lie.
The rains did not stop them from carrying out their work.
Does he not like me?
Get out.
He asked me when to buy a new car.
I had a job to do.
Tom did not like this color.
I liked Christmas songs.
They welcomed us.
I am amazed that you and Tom are not facing each other.
Tell them to be careful.
There are many factors to consider.
I chose to read books rather than watch television.

If I was alone, I would have no correction.
Who is calling this hour?
Tom could not have imagined that such a thing could happen.
Fear you!
What is my room number?
I couldn’t sleep.
Tom made an all - out public.
Tom needed this.
Your name is Muiriel!
How would you have reacted?
There are no roads.
Tom closed one of his eyes.
A little effort would have been made.
Tom had a huge explosion.
What a colossal coache!
Envy.
Tom saved money to go abroad.
He put the ring into Mary’s finger.
How are you?
For what is this?
I miss you.
Whom do you not know here?
He entered through a window.
I agree with your plan.
I paid this guitar three hundred dollars.
I was strengthened.
He was cool to me.
I don’t want to live with regrets for this.
Now there are 20 of Muiriel’s men.
The night was dark.
I no longer like Christmas.
This harsh climate certainly affects plants.
Were they Tom’s shoes?
I don’t have to ask for forgiveness.
The magazine is released twice a month.
Have we not come here?
Did Tom know who I was?
I would sell my house.

Tom tried.
If we were unable to answer all your questions, tell us.
Drinking beer gave me a feeling of well - being.
We are born between the urine and the feces.
This is my skin.
I’m sure Tom wants that.
Each person has his own opinion.
I will tell her at the right time.
Will we wait for Tom here?
What is really needed today is a measure of patience.
Do you know what happened to him?
On my way to school, I usually see plenty of smoke and matches.
How would you answer?
Who is to blame for this?
What could he have done?

I am sad for everyone who cares.
Someone pushed me in.

I had to walk away.
He was my son.
What terrorist group is responsible for this?
Be cautious.
I could not fix it.
Who was Tom’s physician?
Let me know what you decide.
I believe you.
Come here!
I wish I had not lied to you.
They are apprehensive.
Have you ever read any Chinese poem?
Tom gave Mary the money she needed to pay off her debts.
The trees are full of fruit.
Who brought them?
Her name was Irina.
I have been on my own for a long time.
You can no longer recognize Tom.
That is what one generation in the past thought, and that is not the case with today’s generation.
I was in Boston in October.
I was 18 years old.
He hears you.
Come along.
Is there ample time for us to finish this before Tom gets here?
I was happy to learn that he was reinstated.
Only then did he realize that he had been misled.
Water is life.
With a quick kick, the door slammed!
Does he love me?
Embarrassing!
Why not tell them?
Tom had a fever.
Instead, he accompanied his sister.
Where is Paris?
When he realized that someone was following him, he became afraid.
I wondered why everyone left so soon.
I was curious about learning German culture.
Do I place my bags in the house?
He wanted to return home as soon as possible.

They were tired.
Cats catch the tortoise.
Who asked you?
He also watched me as he saw the living whale.
I love movies that have a happy ending.
Tom was sunk down.
Our work.
DO NOT try to answer that question.
From side to side.
Not far from Paris.
We moved the project to a new servant.
You are big.
In what way?
Despite his busy life, he came to see me.
I desperately needed to talk to Tom at any time of the day.
Everyone wants him.
Tom could understand.
Do you have money?
Tom now came on the bicycle.
What?
Let us start.
Do you have a clue as to what this is?
Has it proved to be scientific?
Tom was extremely shy.
How did her son die?
I was running six miles [10 km] a day.
Witchcraft, Widow.
Have you raised children?
What do you think causes this?
You can choose whatever you want.
All three of you are happy too.
A wise person is one who discovers something far more beautiful than a handshake.
The heat was very intense, so I put the fan to work.
That does not happen.

We tried.
Just seeing it made me nervous.
Would you like to know who did this?
Good day, Tom.
Who went to my room?
Would you not, then, hate Tom’s independent act?
The book cost $5.
I’m to be commended.
Life had become difficult.
It hurts, but everyone needs to forget.

What do these boxes contain?
I know what Tom said.
Tom’s appearance changed greatly after he cut his hair.
What are you doing?

Why?

Who brought it?
They took hold of him.
They must marry each other.
Dogs bark.
Tom was lost.

Would everyone suspect me of stealing the money?
Why are you so thin?
I think you have to face Tom.
Tom did secular work.
This scissors could not cut well.
That is so!
Try again.
I would return as soon as possible.
Tom was disappointed.
Tom was the only person today who could help me.

In fact, I came home in October.
I love to cook.
The child is in a flurry of vomiting.
The cat is not a human.

He had no love of art at all.
Would you not hate this type of movie?
I have been younger than three years with you.
It was raining.
Many people were waiting for Tom.
She had to return home.
Do you miss that?
I lost my inspiration.
She lives in a fantastic world.
Linguist training in several Chinese dialects.

You would lack self - confidence.
Instead, you could have succeeded with a little while.
I don’t have as much money as you think.
Do you mean to say this?
I would go to America in the morning.
Wait here.
