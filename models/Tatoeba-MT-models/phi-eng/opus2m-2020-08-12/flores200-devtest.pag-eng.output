The term technological determinism plays a large part in its actual application, ranging from the fact that technology drives all the way to the strict assertion that human destiny is governed by scientific logic and that it emerges from technology.
Two ideas emerge from most technological explanations: technology progresses on its own way without cultural or political influence, and this allows technology to influence people personally rather than man to do so.
