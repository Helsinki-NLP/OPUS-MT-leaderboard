Stars give the sun and heat due to the energy made when hydrogen atoms combine (or join together) together to produce a heavier element.
Scientists work to build reactors that can make energy in a similar way.
But this is a problem that is difficult to solve and it takes many years before we see it made of an existing reactor for fusion.
The steel needle floats over the surface of the water due to the surface tension.
The surface tension occurs because the molecules in the water have a strong attraction to each other than their attraction to the air molecules above them.
Water molecules make an invisible skin on the surface in water that allows things like a needle to float over the water.
The blade of the modern ice skate is two-edged and then has a space between the blades . The two blades make it easier for the blade to stick to the ice, even if parallel.
Because at the bottom of the blade it is slightly curved, the blade is parallel to one side or the other, it also curved into the ice.
That's why skaters go. When skaters turn right, the skater turns right, when on the skate turns to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To return to their former energy level, they had to remove the source of the energy they had taken from the light.
They do this during the release of a small particle of light called "photon".
Scientists call this process "activated radiation output" because atoms are stimulated during a clear light, the source of photon's output in the light, and the light is a means of radiation.
The next image shows atoms producing photons. The reality of photons is, of course, less than what is seen in the image.
Photons are smaller than the objects that make up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation the bulb fiber will eventually burn and the light will no longer turn into a bulb.
The bulb had to be changed, and the bulb was carefully guarded.
The bulb switch must be turned off first, or its cable separated.
This is because the electric current on the walker goes to the junction where the metal part on which the bulb is located and gives you a high pressure if you hold the inner part on the hook or the metal on which it is attached while he is still in the audience.
The main organ of the system of contraction is the heart, which is what pumps the blood.

The triceratop's teeth may be able to break not only leaves but also hard branches and ramots.
Some scientists think that Triceratops is a cycad, a plant species that was common in the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like little coconuts with a crown of sharp, delicate leaves.
Triceratops may have used its powerful bill to remove the leaves before eating the branch.
Some scientists insist that these plants are always toxic so it is possible that dinosaurs would not eat this, even if today the sloth and other animals are examples of parrots (generation of dinosaurs) and can eat poisonous leaves or purtules.
What effect does the gravity of Io have on me? If you stand on the surface of Io, you are much lighter than if you were on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth weighs about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. So gravity, of course, is less drag on you.
The Sun has no crust such as the Earth where you can stand.The total Sun is made of air, fire, and plasma.
The gas is thinning as you move away from the center of the Sun.
The external part that we see when looking at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means "lightbol".
About three thousand years ago, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used the telescope to see that there was a part of Venus, as it is on the moon.
Other appearances take place because only the edge of Venus (or the Moon) facing the Sun is blocked by the sun.The orbits of Venus support Copernicus' theory that the planets revolve around the Sun.
Then, a few years ago in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed the passage of Venus.

When the war for France was over, Germany began preparing to attack the island of Britain.
Germany gave him a code name for the "Operation Sealion" attack. Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies were lost when they moved from Dunkirk, causing the army to be weakened.
But the Royal Navy would still remain stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed any growing large number of ships sent to the English Channel.
However, only a small number of Royal Navy ships were based near potential invasion routes because the admirals were afraid to warn them of an attack by German aircraft.
Let's start with an explanation of Italian's plans.In particular, Italy is the "father" of Germany and Japan.
This had a weaker army and weaker navy, although they had only finished building four new ships before the very beginning of the war.
Italy's main wishes are African countries, and to survive these countries, they have to launch their troops, so these troops sail through the Mediterranean Ocean and conquer Africa.
For that, they would be cleared of British bases and ships in Egypt, and for such moves, Italian warships were not in the other breaths.

His submarines are ships designed to travel deep into the sea, and remain there at a much longer cost of time.
The submarines were used in the First World War and Second World War, during which time they were very slow-moving and their firing was limited in reach.
At the beginning of the war they went up to the sea, but when the radar was formed and the crabs were turned right, they were forced to go underwater so that they could not be seen.
German submarines were called U-Boats, and the Germans were very skilled at driving and operating these submarines.
Because of their success with submarines, the Germans could no longer trust to have many of them.

It is necessary to design interactively rethink your assumptions about media development and learn to think in a non-linear way.
Interactive design can require parts of a project connected to each other, but must also be capable of its own.
What makes the lens of your zoom undesirable is its complex focus and the amount of element in its lens that is needed to get the focus span is much greater than in the primo lenses.
This is no longer a big issue because the lens construction is really getting better.
This allowed for the lens to create a barrier to the images of high quality compared to those taken from the lens with an unconventional distance of focus.
A phenomenon of distance lenses is often the largest aperture or light entrance (passages) in the lens.
This makes it difficult to use the easy-to-understand lens in the least clear if you don't use the flash.
One of the common parodys while trying to convert the DVD format film is overscan.
Most televisions were made to console the public.
Because of that, everything you see on TV is cut above, below, and on both sides of it.
This was done to ensure that the image could cover the entire screen, which was called the overscan.
Unfortunately, if you make a DVD, the edges can be cut, and if the video also has a subtitle close to the bottom, they are invisible fruit.
He has long given inspiration to the imagination of the traditional mediebal castle, which restores images of Arthurian conflicts, feasts and honours.
Even standing during the thousands of years of destruction is easily consumed by the troubles and sounds of completed cries, which are soon heard by the horses’ pillars and smells the fear of floating in the prisons.
But is our imagination based on reality, and why are castles built, or how are they designed and built?

Unlike other monkeys, hominids no longer use their hands to move or support weight or hanging on trees.
The chimpanzee’s hands and feet are the same size and length, indicating the use of the hand to support its weight when walking with the fists of his hand.
THE human hand is shorter than the foot, with straight bones.
The fossil bones of the hand had two million to three million years which revealed this change in how it was held by that hand because of movement until the operation.
Some people believe that experiencing many artificial phenomena is an abstract dream that is often very stressful.
The main reason for this penomenon is the result of deep dreams spreading over the length of time between the REM state.
There is a rare REM every night, this state that you experience when you sleep and in your body can recover becomes less frequent and can become a problem.
This can be exhausting, as if you were waking up every twenty or thirty minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on how many times your brain tries to dream deeply each night.

Perhaps the most common forms of tourism are those dealing with travel: Entertainment tourism.
This is the way people visit a place very different from their usual daily activities in order to relax and enjoy themselves.
Seas, theme park and camp grounds are often common places where entertainers visit regularly.
When one’s visit to a particular site means to get to know one’s past and culture, this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Visitors may visit different landmarks of a country or may choose to have only one destination.

HOPE, or the ability to see, depends on the organ in which the system is conscious or the eyes feel.
There are many different functions of the eyes, its complexity depends on the needs of the organism
Different productions vary in capacity, are sensitive to different wave-lengths and have different degrees of sharpness, and need different processing to make input and different numbers to work well.
The population is a collection of organisms in a particular bank of an area.
If all the people in the population are equal when it comes to one particular phenotypic quality, they are known as monomorphic.

They look like rooms, and he is the first person to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds can move from one person to another without changing.
The nitrogen counterparts still have the same gas as liquid nitrogen.The liquid state is denser than the molecules are the same,
Water is one example. compound water has two atoms in hydrogen and one atom in oxygen.

MRI is based on its physics penome called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (worker at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this sound, magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to create tiny radio signals.
In the 1970’s, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and a scientist who was studying, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, he was patented, and it was the world's first patent in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "good body" MRI scanner, which he called "Indomitable".

The postmodern study approach provides freedom, There is no single path to learning.
In fact, there is not even one good thing to learn. Learning occurs in the experience between learning and the knowledge displayed.
In our current experience of all that you do and present information, the knowledge-based displays can illustrate this point.
Many of us are careful to watch a television program that lets us know of a process or experience that we would not necessarily include or use that knowledge.
We never drove a car, built a fountain in our yard, went to Peru to see early ruins, or changed a neighbor’s house.
