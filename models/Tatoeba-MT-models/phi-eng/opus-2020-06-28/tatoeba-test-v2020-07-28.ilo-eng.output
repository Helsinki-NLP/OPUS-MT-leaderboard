Where did you come from?
What is your name?
Who are they?
We had three airplanes.
What time is it?
Who brought me here?
Birds build nests.
I’m bored all the time.
I didn’t believe this.
Tom visited Mary in 20th October.
To avoid injury or a lack of appetite, make sure to read the item before moving.
Don’t worry, be happy!
Sex is important to me.
I was embarrassed.
We knew what to do.
He was called Jim.
Do not blame them.
Do not forget who you are.
Tom watched Mary leave.
Tom has heard you.
The sun is rising.
She struggled to win the race.
I needed to go to the toilet.
Tom walks.
You hit me with anger.
You need to sleep.
I tell the truth.
Quit smoking.
I don’t really feel that I need to tell you this, but I’m really attracted to your beauty.
Did Tom explain why he doesn’t come?
Tom had a big shot.
Flowers attract bees.
Do you think that he could take me there?
Should we not quit?
He arrived in Japon two years ago.
Tom is missing.
What do you have?
Tom did not think that you would enjoy the idea.
I have left that behind.
I want to apologize for my son.
Tom’s calf looks like pepper.
Tom was a coward.
Do you Recall?
A word of caution is in order.
I want to take my blood into account.
He heard.
Because on Sunday, I did not wake up until morning.
I was not made to think clearly.
The public was notified in 20th October.
Tom did not think so.
The cowards die several times before they die.
This is my son.
Tom is the author.
Tom got a job.
Tom would not trust Mary as she did hers.
They fought for freedom.
Get on your way.
Tom walked.
The ki was a muscle tube.
I had to go to bed.
How would you feel if your wife left you?
A man’s shell takes control of him.
Take a close look at Tom.
Are you sure that Tom lives here?
Tom could have gone to Boston in search of work.
Tell me the time you are coming.
Tom won anyone.
Who came here?
Morning comes at a half hour.
Let us try to change the system.
Who is responsible for that?
How many kinds of vegetables do you cultivate in your garden?
A foreign language cannot be learned in two weeks.
I had headaches.
The towel was wet.
Tom is richer than anyone else here.
She was overwhelmed by unexpected obstacles.
Because on Sunday, I did not get up early.
Would you like to wear clothes tonight?
Be generous with Tom.
She sent a card to Mary.
Cat life was nine.
Tom no doubt knew why Mary had left town.
Do you hate Tom so much?
I’m sure Tom accepted the message.
Do you go up or do not agree with your teenager’s viewpoint?
The heroes were losing blood in my veins.
I cannot come.
I wanted to keep her close by.
No one could stand in my way.
All of you seem to be busy.
Tom wasn’t giving.
What is UFO’s?
Love your neighbor.
Do you need help to do this?
When did you paint your wall?
Smoking?
I could not solve this problem in any way.
The meaning of words is easy to understand.
Who owns it?
I had a cat and a dog, and the dog was black and white.
I was forced to lie.
The rains did not stop their operation.
Did he dislike me?
Get out.
He asked me when I could buy a new car.
I had a job to do.
Tom did not like this color.
I liked the songs Masses.
They made us feel good.
I’m surprised that you and Tom don’t match each other.
Tell them to be cautious.
There are many factors to consider.
I would rather read books than watch television.
Who disappeared?
Is that true or not?
Don’t watch TV until you’re finished.
How much time do you spend reading your lessons?
First they beat the prisoner and put him to death.
Be cautious.
They were like families.
Tom arrived here early.
Last October.
Can we do so only by saying good - bye, Tom?
I was free all day on Monday.
She was embarrassed to breast - feed in public.
Could he help me?
He likes to fish.
Would you like to drink beer?
Cats don’t like getting wet.
What do you fear?
Tom was not a coward.
Expenses were paid.
On my own, I gave no correction.
Who is calling this hour?
Tom did not think that could happen.
Dug!
What was my room number?
I couldn’t sleep.
Tom made a name for himself.
Tom needs this.
Happyly named, Muriel!
How would you have reacted?
There is no path.
Tom closed one eye.
A little effort, perhaps, would have been successful.
Tom had a massive explosion.
What a huge carriage!
Envy is present in your heart.
Tom saves money to go abroad.
She put the ring on Mary’s finger.
What about you?
For what is this?
I miss you.
Whom do you not know here?
Through a window, he walked in.
I agree with your plan.
I paid three hundred dollars for this guitar.
I was strengthened.
He was cold to me.
I don’t want to live in a repentant way because of this.
Muriel is now in his 20 ’ s.
The night was especially dark.
I don’t want Christmas anymore.
This bad climate is sure to affect crops.
Was Tom jealous of them?
There was no need to apologize.
The magazine was released twice a month.
Have we not already come here?
Did Tom know who I was?
I sold my home.
The Passover was fast approaching.
Tom tried.
If we cannot answer all your questions, tell us.
Being a beer drink gives me a feeling of well - being.
We are born between urine and diarrhea.
This skin is soft.
I’m sure Tom liked that.
Each person has his own opinion.
I will speak to him at the proper time.
Will we wait here?
What we need today is a little patience.
Do you know what happened to him?
On my way to school, I usually see lots of smoke and pussas.
How would you answer?
Who is responsible for this?
What could be?
I was afraid of being alone at night.
The king’s firstborn son would inherit the throne.
Support me.
When a woman first sneezes, she tears her hymen and bleeds.
Tom and I learned to cook.
The doctors were still trying to rescue Tom.
You are not married, are you?
Do not worry; it’s just temporary.
This was not an easy decision.
I forgot my password!
Tom needs it.
I felt sad for everyone concerned.
Someone pushed me deeper.
Here I am as a tourist.
I had to jump.
It was my son.
What terrorist group is doing this?
Be careful.
I couldn’t fix it.
Which of you was Tom’s physician?
Let me tell you what you have to decide.
I will put my faith in you.
Come here!
I would not have lied to you.
They were not old enough.
Have you ever read any Chinese poems?
Tom gave Mary the money she needed to pay off her debts.
The fruit was carried by trees.
Who brought them?
Her name is Mary.
I have been alone for a long time.
You can’t even recognize Tom.
That was the view of an age past, and it is not the way people today think.
I was in Boston as early as October.
Self - interest.
He has heard you.
Come along.
Do we have enough time to get Tom to come here?
I was thrilled to learn that he had been rich.
Only then did he realize that he had been misled.
Water is life.
With a sharp kick, the door is locked!
Does he love me?
How shameful!
Why not tell them?
Tom had a fever.
Instead, she went with them.
Where is Paris?
When he saw that someone was there, he became afraid.
I wondered why everyone had left so soon.
I was interested in learning German culture.
Would I buy my bags?
He wanted to leave as soon as possible.
You will be rewarded when you choose to be six.
I’ll try.

All my friends liked soccer.
I just don’t have time to watch TV.
Unless it rains, I go too.
Have you ever shelled a shot?

This is a horse.
I spent an entire night with my friends.
The hero is with you.
I’m tired of watching TV.
Do you know which one was in Tom’s suitcase?
This is a towering tree.
We hope to meet again.
Finding a suitable place to live can be relatively easy.
You will need more than ten boxes of beer for our gathering.
I had a tingling of ears.
I would pay the bill.
Three out of every four marriages and result in separation.
Don’t worry.
We caught him trying to get him out of his room.
Most likely that would not happen.
I came, saw, defeated.
This earth is cold.
They are exhausted.
Cats catch a turtle.
Who asked you?
She had never seen a live whale before.
I liked films with happy endings.
Tom was released.
Let’s talk about it.
DO NOT try to answer that question.
Left.
Not far from Paris.
We transferred the project to a new shoper.
You are a big one.
True?
Despite her busy schedule, she came to see me.
I needed to talk to Tom at any time today.
Everyone wants him.
Tom understands.
Do you have the money?
Tom came here on a bicycle.
What?
Let’s get started.
Do you have a clue as to what this is?
Has it proved to be scientific?
Tom was very shy.
How did her son die?
I was running for six miles [10 km] every day.
Go away, widow.
Do you have children?
What do you think caused this?
You can choose which ones you want.
All three of you are happy too.
A wise person is one who has discovered something far better than skin loss.
It was so hot that I ordered the fan.
That cannot be the case.

Who volunteered?
On my way home, I witnessed to an attractive young woman.
It is raining today, and even worse, thunders.
They were accused of providing weapons to terrorists.
Mary is looking forward to giving birth in October.
How tall was Tom?
Do you like wine?
Tom collected all the letters that Mary sent him.
I just cared about that.
We needed evidence.
It is the bride.
Insecurity is dangerous.
We have tried.
Just seeing it made me nervous.
Would you like to know who caused this?
Good day, Tom.
Who had gone to my room?
Don’t you, though, resent Tom’s habit of being alone in the space?
The book costs $5.
I was honored.
Life has become complicated.
It hurts but has to forget everything.
They required that all copies of the book be destroyed.
Tom did nothing more than TV.
There is only one way to live.
I’m sorry.
She says she is happy.
Cats are intelligent.
Tom was nowhere to be found.

We have work to do.

Tom could not use this.
Help me.
I feel good about myself.
He was proud of his skill in cooking.
Your plan is good, but I plan better.
Dug!
The cat laughed.
Are you married?
I don’t have a cat.
What do these boxes contain?
I knew what Tom said.
Tom looked very different after she cut her hair.
What do you do?
Tom was stabbed to the ground.
I wanted to scream.
You Can Speak Italian?
I was too afraid to go there by myself.
Why?
Tom was mad at me.
Who brought it?
They robbed him of his well - being.
She had to get married.
Dogs bark.
Tom was taken aback.
The blackness is enormous.
You need to be there.
He asked me some questions.
I got ready for lunch early.
Would everyone suspect that I was the one who had stolen the money?
Why are you so thin?
I think you will have to face Tom.
Tom got a job.
This scissors do not sit fast.
It is so!
Try again.
I would return as soon as possible.
Tom was disappointed.
Tom is the only person who can help me today.
You are cute.
Have any of you ever seen something like this before?
We may not have to sell our home.
When does it occur?
Again, Tom was very early in life.
The fact is, he is not there.
The shape had already been molded.
They fought for freedom.
They motivated him to commit a crime.
I wanted to go somewhere quiet.
The seven weekends were Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday.
You have heard you singing.

Law is law.
Who called you?
What a large town!
He remained silent.
It was raining, and the friendship stopped.
I loved going to the movies.
Do you think you could be a policeman?
All my friends want you.
Yes, but that?
Do you want to get drunk?
In fact, I was returning home in October.
I love to cook.
The baby is urinating.
The cat is not a human.
I agree with you.
Do you still need my help?
I had two cats.
Do not come to me.
This will never cease.
This cave was full of bats.
He comes this afternoon.
Where will you go?
Did Tom tell you if he had hidden diamonds?
"United Nations" means "UN".
CAN you simply sign our petition?
What could a priest have known about the use of arms?

He had no love for art.
Don’t you hate a movie of this kind?
I am three years younger than you.
It was raining.
Many people were waiting for Tom.

Will you accept an invitation to travel?
This place is mine.
I want to join your plan.
Hey! I forgot my password!
What kept you from working?
Where is my bicycle?
I did not believe you.
Tom does not like the decisions we make.
There was no need to apologize.
His main purpose in life was to become rich.
They are more blessed than the hand - held.
I’ll shake the sea just to see your smile again.
Their explosions were huge.
It seemed that Tom was a total stranger to the job.
Many things have changed since I was a child.
Close that door!

Go back to the folds in the box.
Why do you resort to delirium?
Would you like another one like these?

We need to move.
How old are you with Tom?
Those people were not happy.
I was sure that everything was understood.
We joke.
Tom may have been an spy.
You and your spouse likely have a busy schedule.
I could only dream of learning how to do that.
I made a mistake.
My hometown was Zamboana.
Don’t let him sit on your back.
Tom had to go home.

We had a reputation.
The day of the Passover is early in the morning.
We must start.
Aside from the importance of sleep, its purpose is a mystery.
Tom’s problems.
Who else was there?
Tom did not win.
I guess he just had to leave me alone.
We tried to celebrate her birthday.
Terrorists failed.
There were little people on the beach.
