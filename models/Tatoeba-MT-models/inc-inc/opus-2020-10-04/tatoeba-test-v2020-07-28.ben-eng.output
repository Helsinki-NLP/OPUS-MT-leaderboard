What does this sign mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Stay here.
Have I been too late?
Leave her.
I can't say right.
The language is a holo communication media.
Tom knows that.
I never listen to Tom.
How long did the next train go for Tokyo?
Tom's taking a big risk.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Are you going to America in the next month?
I don't want to go to sleep.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He's not here yet.
I'm sorry!
You want to tell me how much.
The ice represents the sluggish steel.
Come out.
They screamed.
I ran home.
We built a pancake for restaurant.
Do you have a bicycle?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're screaming.
He's clear.
He doesn't want to talk about this.
Everybody saw it.
I'll give my kid to eat in the morning and in the morning.
My son came to my house.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your password?
Please give me my pronunciation.
Do what he says.
I'm so tired to see you.
Tom started shouting.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always keeps his word.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We saw them.
Today's June 18th and today's Moriarian birthday.
Who won?
Let's get ready.
We're gonna have to call the empty tom to do this for us, right?
Can these be found in a fixture?
I'm going to the Osaka station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for it.
Someone's lost.
I'm in the bank.
I learned to live without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Just take a moment.
Tom was busy with work.
I'm not proud of the way I used.
I'm scared.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm staring.
I'm not doing the right thing.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is this Tom Book?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could've died.
Are you sure?
I have to go now.
He ignores reading.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He's easily hot down his head.
Wherever he goes, his dog's back behind him.
Who is this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
My goal is to collect the old bottles.
I like the number.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
Do you have a bicycle?
You want to come?
My mom can play a very good joke.
He knows where we are.
I know your name.
Tom isn't here.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped shouting.
Tom, how old?
Come on!
Stop painting.
Tom was there?
I've paid blood tonight.
I'm still in trouble.
Where's Tom?
It seems American to see them.
You were the only friend of Tom.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My father can drive a good car.
I'll be alone.
You need your friend.
Forget tom.
I think Tom said he was his first Jackson.
You know Tom for a long time from me.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My bags haven't reached yet.
Tom hasn't come here yet.
Please wait until he arrives.
Tom keeps his word a little bit.
Something's going on.
Is anyone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's good.
Where will I get the stamp?
I'm going to tea.
Can he speak French?
Tom can take it.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
Don't you have a little more?
And one day he left.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friends.
Guess that woman.
How old was that Church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where am I going to claim my bags?
We do what we want.
Tommy's right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for all students whose native language is not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be a minister.
Who will you trust?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I deserved.
No one's indestructible.
Are you here?
The rest are laughing.
How much night will you stay?
Have you seen people in this picture?
I lost my bag.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to watch Tom.
My son is getting financially.
It looks like the snow can start tonight.
How much would it cost?
You know what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I want Tom to be happy.
You shouldn't have to blow the rocks of those who live in the bedroom.
Why are you screaming?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to the hospital.
Tom wants his shadow back.
Is Tom at home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'm drunk.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city is divided into a river east and west.
Look at yourself.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have your car?
Tomo singer.
Do you think you're doing something now?
He's lurking now.
Can you keep watch on Tom?
You should ask her for advice.
This teeth is hitting.
How much do these flowers?
How much more would you give?
Everyone loved Tom.
What's going on here?
Take this key of yours.
Are you Japanese?
Just take a moment.
Eat whatever you like.
Take it.
Have you ever broken your bones?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't run my right foot.
I'm cutting off.
How old are you?
Can I ask a question?
What is that?
Take this key of yours.
We've seen something worse.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
He likes gas.
You don't understand.
My mother's getting sick.
Sit down the table.
He's smaller than me.
What is your name?
We're waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use the credit card?
It's too big, isn't it?
This book is found only in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I pay the credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went home to Jackson.
He got a black tape.
Anything else?
Everybody was scared.
Is there any room for students?
I eat nodles.
Tom's in the house.
Don't ask how they're going to be, ask what they do.
Will you come in?
I mean.
We like football game.
What are you eating?
Good evening.
He's empty.
I want a new suit for these shoes.
Everyone loved Tom.
Who is that?
I'm still your friends.
Enjoy.
Please listen!
He's running.
I'll go to sleep if you're raining tomorrow.
My right arm is blazing.
My father was busy.
Everyone's ready to go.
I couldn't get the train at 7:00.
He had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's talk.
You got a pen?
The class isn't starting eight years ago.
You're gonna eat time for lunch?
What does that word mean?
How much do I get?
Can you say English?
They're wrong.
My son is long from me.
Tom's parents were singers.
Here you go.
Tom's alive.
She's looking at her in the facqa.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is it worth?
You can eat as much as you want.
Leave it.
I've lost a little bit.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Put it in.
How old are you?
Take Tom.
They were scared.
You're shouting.
I don't think it's raining tomorrow.
I'll come back when I'm over.
I like the light.
He's grown in France.
She didn't work at Sunday.
He taught me to write.
Good birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
The Teroans were killed.
There's nothing to eat except his fruit.
Tom's father is a supercar.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
It's time.
I never missed.
Where's the upper door in the UA11?
I'm screwing.
Why are you tearing?
Tom wants his shadow back.
You normally go to bed when?
The country made a contract between both of them.
I'm talking to Tom in a free French language.
Tom beat his eyes.
Can you give it a little gift?
Tom is now in the car.
What did you forget?
I don't really want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's laughing.
He's not here yet.
It's not mine.
Who did you come?
He's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The terrorists left the prisoners.
I could go with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my humanity.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government has trodden down.
Leave the city!
Grow until Tirz.
He's eating.
How old was that Church?
Let's go!
Inny can say Japanese.
Did you see her going away?
How much is the Shatal bus for the airport?
Don't argue.
That's mine.
That's my bag.
I have an old computer that I don't need any more.
I got Testa.
We've been walking on our feet.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom screamed.
Tom's just a little funny.
Eat what you want.
Tom's crying.
How much is it worth?
I'm good.
They're a doctor.
The plane's up to nine minutes.
I don't know what you want to understand.
Most of the spectators were business.
Turn right.
Tom's sleeping.
I've got a lot of food.
Tom's running a lot.
He knows where we are.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Tom's smoked.
Everyone was screaming.
I'll be out.
My mom can sleep well.
They were scared.
The research was successful.
I think the gold that Tom received is too little to be given to him.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17.
Here you go.
Leave Tom.
Eat your milk.
Our names are Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who breaks the flower?
Tom's injured.
Follow the Tom.
Is Tom still angry with me?
Tom's gone.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not down.
Do you know what she said?
Listen to me.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you screaming?
What is your father's name?
Look over there.
Tell me if I do anything.
We tried.
Tom canceled on October.
The market is near the doctor.
Good Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What does this sign mean?
Tom left his head.
Are we ready?
I like Tom Blue Anners.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen to me.
Will you go to buy me?
Take it easy.
They're there.
I'll tear.
Everyone's busy.
Don't let me sleep.
Who was it?
I'm Lajuk.
When I said that Mary left the city, I was really surprised to see Tom.
I heard a scream.
How long is your plane?
Uni doesn't want to talk about this.
My book seemed to be interesting.
Tell me what happened.
I've got eight o'clock.
Please fire the light.
Tom hurt.
I'm still your friends.
I took more than two hours to translate some pages of English.
Is that yours?
Who is he?
Is it the little way to go to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
Did you know him?
It's impossible!
How long did the train reach Yokohama?
How bad is it?
The words will not correct the right words, and you can add more common translations instead.
Your shoes are here.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to cry for you.
Listen, is this train going to the Washington Scorchor?
We've failed.
There's AC in this house.
Did you get the whole thing?
Tom was Boston.
Make it clear.
Don't open that.
Tom saw him.
Morning, the snow can be drizzle.
I'm not proud of that.
There's someone there?
It's wrong.
I'm no longer young.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Can you get fish with us?
Just wait here.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
One minute.
Tom was injured.
Mary explained.
I'm not denying it.
Don't see!
Make it complete as soon as possible.
Use it.
How long did the train reach Yokohama?
I don't understand that.
I've got seven hours tonight.
I'm at home.
Run slowly.
Good day!
I'm in.
Me too.
I'm not too busy.
That's great.
Do it again!
Tom started in space.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "I don't want to go."
I know it.
I'll stay close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
I'm sick of my feet.
Ask Tom.
I'm thinking what I'll give you at birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Nice to see you again.
Why are you screaming?
Stay right there.
Eat what you like.
We played the park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy the ticket?
I've finished my work.
I'm planning to stay in the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started shouting.
I'm not quarreling.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom's happy.
Don't enter in.
We're lost.
Tom's chewing.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm looking empty. Thank you.
Unfortunately this is true.
We were waiting for them.
How many years do I see?
Tom's not happy here.
Annie was angry.
I don't like to eat coffee.
Speak calmly.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to meet Tom?
Here you go.
We don't care what he does.
I called my good friend Tom.
We can't play better than it.
We're Lajuk.
The bill can be given today.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's not right.
Eat whatever you like.
I have the Wins.
Why did Tom cry?
