I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
You know and I do that there's no chance that Tom will do that.

I know Tom might need to do that by himself.
Tom doesn't seem to be doing what he's supposed to be doing.
It would have been tiring to do that.
Tom must tell us the truth.

We have to do something.
When do you plan to do that?

Tom told me he didn't know how to play the obo.
I'd like to use this opportunity to thank you.

There is no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom doesn't have enough money to buy whatever he wanted.
Did he touch you?
Tom and Mary said they'd be doing that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today's the twentyth of October.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary is not Canada.
Africa is not a country.
Tom was not the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have kids.
I know that Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I think that book is not so interesting.
I was told that's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team's gonna continue to get better.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom certainly knows he should not do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It's a big responsibility.
I think you should turn in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should know I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom worked together.
Nobody will know I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed to get more exercise.
Tom told me he tried to do that.
Tom and Mary know they should not do that.
Tom said Mary thought she might be needed to do that next time he travels.
I knew Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she should not do that.
Tom said he knew I might need to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn't know she's in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom is concerned.
I wish I had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew Tom was going to be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in prison.
Tom said that Mary thought she wouldn't have to do that by myself.
Tom said he probably won't.
It's possible tom may not know that I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom thinks he knows it all.
Tom said it's not going to end well.
Tom and Mary said they could not do that today.
I thought we had something to give to Tom.
The pupils did the work themselves.
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind doing that.
You'll stay here until you are called.
My daughter is training toilet.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could do that.
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling good.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something happened to him.
Nobody suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said things he should not say.

Tom says he did nothing illegal.
I doubt Tom knows that Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know Tom knows how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still chatting away.
You're a nerd.
Everyone was late except me.
He could not resist the temptation.
Tom might be angry if you do that.
I thought Tom would agree with that.
I am a libertarian.
Can I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom can help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom will have to do that alone.
She wants to know who sent flowers.
My hearing is not as good as it was.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admits that he was 'rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should talk about that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know Tom is a little older than Mary.
Tom didn't know someone was hired to kill him.
Tom told me he couldn't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would enjoy doing that.
Tom said he thought I wouldn't need to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me he thought he could do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was eager to do that.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know that Tom is a bully.
He's a most smart boy.
How is your father?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous.
I'm very sure that it wasn't what Tom meant.
It won't be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired to him.
I doubt Tom would ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning to go anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it looks like.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he never planned to live in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot more books than you do.
I know Tom is about the same height as you are.
There is no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who put drugs in my bag.
Tom said he was happy that Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she read the book that he'd pay her.
He woke up at seven o'clock.
I could do that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't yet told anyone they're getting married.
They said they planned to go to Somalia.
It's not easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't talk so fast, please.
They told me that they had bacons and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone that they had to do that.
I think Tom paid too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worn out.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was busy.
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

You should stay where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose weight.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could have kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary's not awake.
Did anyone else hug Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to hurt me.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone scared?
Tom thinks he can do anything he sets his mind to.
We married seven years ago.
I could have done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't get angry with me!
I don't think Tom could do that any better.
I know Tom didn't do that right.
She's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary is better than she really is in French.
Tonight I'm free.
You think Tom would do that?
That's his house.
I'm at home.
You don't have to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should have tried harder.
I thought Tom was gonna do that today.
They promised they'd check it.
I'm sure Tom would agree.
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that.
Tom said he knew he might have to do that by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the last goal, but the process of getting there.
Tom must put a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance that Tom might hurt.
Tom said he was happy that you did that.
I always knew that Tom was a troublemaker.
Well I never!
Tom thinks Mary will not be able to win.
I'm a student, but he's not.

I wonder if Tom really is homeick.

I wish I could be someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom is not busy.
I just wanted you to know I support you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We're all in serious danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I just have a hard-boiled egg for myself.
Have you got a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia the next summer.
Tom and Mary may not be able to buy everything they need for $300.
They said they like this year.
Tom wants Mary to know that she can trust him.
They say they've lost that deal.
I know that Tom didn't know you could not do that.
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few more weeks.
With his last breath, he told him that he was taken.
I know Tom is a real close friend of Mary's.
I know who Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom think we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom won't do that?
I know Tom would probably agree with that.
Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
It's obvious tom can't do that without some help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plan to do that.
Tom could have asked me first.
You're not actually suggesting I'm going out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should.
I don't think Tom is bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't do that.
I would have done that by myself if Tom didn't help me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plan.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary did that.
Tom and Mary swore they would never hit me again.
Tom said he should have stayed in Australia longer.

I know I can do this.
I don't think I should leave before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I've already told Tom I need to do that.
I'm planning to stay at home all day Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could steal Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one conflicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom is amused by what's going on?
We haven't yet started to fight.
Who's knocking at the door?
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They say they're supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everyone.
Tom and Mary told me that they were ambidecraft.
Tom said he thought what Mary did was a mistake.
I hope no one comes.
I thought everyone could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said that she thought Mary was in her bedroom study.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's going to be OK.
Tom told me that it didn't matter.
I know Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I'm twelve.
I forgot about that.
Tom told everyone he was doing that.
They figured there was no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were happy.
I thought you were happy you didn't do that.
Tom can speak a little French.
I know Tom is a lot more taller than I.
I thought that was what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that's going to happen.
I knew Tom was not too busy.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom is faster to do that than Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary might not be needed to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everyone has a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said.
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John Alice.
I wonder if Tom will be able to do that.
Tom thought it was hard.
We've walked all around the lake.
I don't think it's going to be difficult to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom is rich as most people think he is.
You'll do no such thing.
You're so hot!
Tom would have been 30 years old today if he had not passed away last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know Tom knows I want to do that.
I wonder whether Tom is safe.
I know that Tom didn't know he should not do that here.
Do Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like that.
I don't understand how this might have happened.
You're as high as my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom's already done enough.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Tom said he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you would be happy to see me.
Tom admitted that he was the one who stole Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told to do that.
We better tell others.
Why are everyone talking about Tom?
Federa held in love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do what you ask them to do.
I know Tom could save himself a lot of time by doing that myself.
Tom said he was hoping he and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that made him angry.
When will he be done?
You're a very rude boy.
Tom plan to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of pilaf with some cabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning to do that.
Tom said he was wondering whether Mary could do that.
Who sends letters by mail? We have emails these days.
If something is very good to be true, then it may be.
Tom said he hopes you don't want to do that.
Tom said he wanted to not be there.
I thought you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in any hurry.
We may need to be in Australia for several weeks.
I didn't plan to do that, but I could if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who is able to do that.
Tom said he expected Mary to share.
I swim every day.
Who is the lucky man?
They pretended they didn't know me.
I know Tom is a little smaller than Mary.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know Tom and I'm not going to do that, don't you?
Tom and Mary told me that they finished doing that by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have left back there.
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Gaulish.
I thought you might not be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he forgot something.
She doesn't like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom's really got a lot on his plate at the moment.
I knew Tom who needed to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That's not what I said.
They put their books down.
I know Tom is a better driver than I.
I thought you loved Tom.
That's not worth the current technologies.
They said they tried to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office speaks French.
I wonder if Tom already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're sick.
Tom said he's not allowed to do that.
I think you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
You have a sense of humor. I like that.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom would refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you cook a omelet?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk any more.
I wonder if we can do anything to help.
Tom said he would be willing to help us do that.
I don't think Tom is capable of that.
Tom didn't know he had to do that by himself.
Tom's dating a girl who's three years younger than he is.
I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that.
Tom said he was not interested in sports.
Tom said he thought Mary would not want to do that.
I know Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think Tom would like this wine.
I believe we spoke on the phone.
I know tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There is a certain amount of truth in what he says.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom is a slob.
He is not a virtuo.
I doubt Tom lied to me.
Tom will finally have to do that.
Tom told me he'd call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't yet told Mary what he has to do.
I know that Tom is a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should stay home.
I don't think this is enough food to feed all of us.
He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he was planning to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends are not here.
A wolf cannot be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he hasn't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he had to do.
Tom said I should study hard.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't pay.
Are you worried that it might happen?
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary did that.
Don't forget to take your umbrella when you leave here.
I'll see that's done.
I wear a suit but no tie.
I'm as tired as you.
Tom thought he might be coming down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have apologized right away.
You're lucky you didn't hurt.
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
Are you sure Tom will do that?
We can't live without air.
I didn't know that Tom hated Mary.
Tom says Mary has always lived in Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't nervous.
Tom knows something we don't do.
Tom said he was worried about Mary.

Last night I kicked.
Tom's not very good in bowing.
Tom said Mary gave him something.
Give me some water.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be mad.
I don't think you're paying attention.
We'll need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary is doing.
Tom said Mary's gonna do that tomorrow.
You both are welcome to come with us.
I can't believe Tom's actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he ate too much.
We're all waiting for your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that soon.
Have I ever told you guys about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying the French when I was 13 years old.
Tom said he wouldn't have played chess with Mary.
I know that Tom might allow you to do that.
Is it OK if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that by himself.
I wonder if Tom is moved.
Tom said he would have done that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you were to do that.
I think Tom would not like that if Mary did that.
I still want you to do that.
Mary let me know she wasn't planning to stay too long.
I didn't know you were gonna be jealous.
Tom didn't know that Mary had children.
They say they can't wait that long.
I'm surprised that you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom may be alone.
Tom said he thought Mary was not too busy.
I'm absolutely sure that's not going to happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was happy you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary is planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do that.
You're very upset.
I've already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom would not be a good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You've finished your homework, didn't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary likes him or not.
I'm lost in the woods.
I know Tom is a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me he'd be in Boston next week.
Keep your mouth shut!
Tom said he knew he might need to do that on Monday.
Tom said he regretted what happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary that he had to do that.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
Have you got a pen on you?
Tom lets Mary do what she wants to do.
I'll wait till 2:30.
My parents won't let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it will take for him to do that.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why didn't you eat the food I cooked?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried his father's clothes.
I doubt Tom won't tell Mary why he did that.
Tom said he was trying to do that all week.
You really have beautiful teeth! Are they real?
No one knew that Tom was the man who contributed most of the money.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was disappointed.
Tom and I were both a bit confused.
I'm sure Tom knew that was going to happen.
Tom told me he thought he could do that.
I admit what Tom said I should not.
Did you know that Tom and Mary had three children?
It's not just a small problem.
I'm not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom's done that already.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should do that.
There must be a reason that Tom is not here.
It's not proper to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me that he thought Mary could run as fast as he could.
Tom said Mary is scared.
You should have been the last one to do that.
I know Tom is a farmer, but I don't know where his farm is.
Tom says the matter is urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like that.
What could be wrong?
No one could stop that.
Tom said he had to share a hotel room with a stranger.
I know I said I did it, but I can't do it today.
I think Tom is overemotional.
I am immune to smallpox.
Tom sometimes sleeps on my couch.
My class was cancelled.
Tom and Mary told me to go through the time they got here.
Tom promised me he was here by 2:30.
Tom said he thinks Mary can take care of herself.
It's not as cold here as I hope it would be.
Tom said he just got back from Australia.
I don't think I'll be alone.
I can't work now.
The game is about to start.
Tom said Mary was born in Boston.

I know Tom will be ready to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was jealous.
Does anyone else know you're here?
Tom said he wanted to go to the zoo.
Tom said he thought Mary was unhappy in Boston.
Didn't you know that Tom was not planning on that?
I know Tom knew who's gonna do that for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows she's not happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
Tom said he didn't think of the noise disturbed Mary.
No one ran.
Tom said Mary would probably do that.
I met someone who knows we were.
Tom said he thought those shoes were too expensive.
Tom said he knew he wouldn't need to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried that Tom's gonna lose.
They told me they were next.
I doubt Tom and Mary are not eager to do that just as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the chance to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't Ticklyish.
I know Tom did that just to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smart than that.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm ugly.
Tom told me he called you.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they'd eat too much.
He's old enough to drive a car.
Tom said he forgot to lock the door.
I know Tom is afraid people may laugh at him.
Tom said Mary was probably still mad.
Tom and Mary say they feel better now.
They hate foreigners; I hate everyone.
Tom said he's not sure Mary can swim.
I don't know if Tom will come tomorrow or not.
They said they were too busy.
I promise you we'll find a big place.
I think Tom is the only one who has to do that.
I didn't think you'd win.
I don't think Tom will have the time to do that with us today.
I know Tom is very concerned.
We can't let these upstarts push us around.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend is.
I knew who could do that and who could not.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom's not so sure.
Everyone here knows we don't eat pork.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't do that.
I think Tom doesn't know how to do that.
I've already told Tom that I don't plan on doing that.
I thought it would be fun to live in Boston for a year or two.
It's not healthy to skip food.
I'm glad to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I doubt Tom and Mary are the ones who did that.
I bet I can sit here longer without saying something more than you can.
It's not done yet.
I know that Tom is not on the team anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know he should not do that.
Tom just turned the radio on.
Tom has already decided he's not going to say yes.
I know that Tom is a little snobbish.
What's in the box?
Tom said Mary knew he might not want to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're not alone.
Tom said he would have done that by himself if he could.
Recognizing that there is a problem is the first step to fix the problem.
Mary said she planned to go.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be away.
Tom said that Mary was lying.
I don't think Tom would be upset if I did that.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't be there.
They said they figured I could win.
Tom means everyone, isn't he?
Tom is not really in Boston now.
I hope to get an email from you today.
I thought Tom was uncompressed.
Tom is no longer a suspect.
There's nothing here.
I thought Tom didn't do that well.
I knew Tom would do that right away.
Why didn't you go to Boston?
Tom said he doesn't plan to do that again.
Tom said that made him very happy.
I understand tom can get Mary to show us how to do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary will say yes.
I was afraid I might be late for the bus.
You are not allowed to bring dogs to this building.
Tom and Mary swore they would not do that.
I know I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
You're welcome.
I couldn't believe it was over so fast.

I was the only one who knew Tom didn't want to do that.
I doubt so serious that Tom did it on purpose.
I figured you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do that by ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me too much.
I thought it was impossible for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something about that next night.
Tom admits he wasn't brave.
I know I should do that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
I doubt Tom is waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead can't bite.
I don't think Tom is crazy as some people think.
I don't think I'll be able to do that by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
She avoided his eyes.
Tom is not as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do that by myself.
Tom says Mary is still planning to do that.
I thought Tom must be wrong.
Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason why Mary moved to Boston.
I should have introduced myself.
Tom said Mary's waiting to be retired.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I've never fallen in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom complained about that.
Tom is liked by everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you're crazy.
He hasn't got a mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John would not be allowed to do that himself.
There's no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I doubt Tom is involved.
How many kilos have you lost?
Both Tom and Mary are OK.
I'm a negative human.
I will never forget the time you and I went together to Australia.
Tom is not the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary both decided not to leave.
Tom told me he's sleeping.
Mary tried her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted that he stole Mary's bicycle.
I got off the lid.
Tom said Mary was probably in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that here.
I'm three years old than you are.
When is your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's clear that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would help you.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun doing that.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been on a meal for more than a year.
Tom said he wasn't ready to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary already had a driver's license.
I know Tom is a good drummer.
Tom realized he would not be able to change anything.
Tom said Mary should have done that alone.
I didn't know you were still with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy a weathervenue.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canada?
Come on, guys.
I doubt Tom is at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they'd do that again.
Tom threw it.
Tom doesn't like this colour.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy to marry Tom.
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here.
Tom and Mary say they don't care.
Tom didn't stay in Boston as long as he wanted.
Tom said he was a Canadian.
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
I presum that Tom is still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone knows he's enjoying that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know Tom can do that sometime today.
Do you let your children play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts that Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the desk.
I think Tom is unkind.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is it really Tom moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom could make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess these days.
I don't think I liked living in Australia.
Tom said Mary should have done that by myself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was deceived.
What you're saying is absolutely wrong.
He is depressed.
I know I need to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary is thirsty.
They said they didn't enjoy doing that.
I'm playing apps.
They said they would never study French.
They said they thought I was created.
Tom told me he's uncertain about what he should do.
Tom told me I should say yes.
Tom didn't press button.
There was nothing left in the frij.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not have to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know that Mary could not speak French very well.
I don't think there's any chance that I'll get there on time.
I think both Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he doesn't plan to go with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom is sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everyone loves free things.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does that, I will.
I know that Tom's still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they're ready to help me.
Tom is not the one who told me that Mary should do that.
I thought you said you would still like to do that.
Tom said he was wondering whether Mary wanted to do that.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom's a nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they really didn't expect anyone to do that.
Tom said that it was Mary who told him that he should do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary's upset.
I don't think I can hold so long.
Tom is not as high as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think the heat caused Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom that I disagreed.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I've already promised Tom I'd help him.
I believe everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to be at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know I have to do that today.
I don't think you really want to call that attention.
Tom said he knew that Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were gonna kill John.
Leave the lights on, please.
Tom said it's a nice place to visit Australia.
I thought Tom was in a big problem.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech lasted for three hours.
I wonder whether Tom is alive.
I might try to get a hatchet from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think anyone wants to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares.
I think Tom won't be in Australia too long.
Tom told Mary he'd never come back here.
I didn't know you could not do that by yourself.
I doubt Tom will never agree with that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom is unacceptable.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know Tom is more likely to do that than he was yesterday.
I think Tom's doing something illegal.
Our streets are flooding when we have rain.
I'll be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have a lot of choice.
Tom said he thought he could do that on October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I knew that Tom might be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know Tom is a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everyone here except Tom has done that.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everyone has a idea what Tom is capable of.
Tom knew he could do that better.
Tom said he wanted Mary to do that no more by himself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was angry.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a university student.
I think Tom didn't do that, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I've made enough spaghetti for everyone.
I know Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she needs to do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that by myself.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that it's not going to happen.
Tom plan to sit back.
Tom said he gave a book to Mary.
It would have been unsatisfying.
I know that Tom probably knows how to do that.
I know that Tom was a scrawny kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're partly blamed.
I'm not surprised that Tom's plan on doing that.
Hardly anyone expected to win Tom.
Don't break my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job was to be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put your jacket on if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary he was not planning to stay in Australia too long.
I hear you gave up smoking.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes that much.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me he was next.
Tom said that Mary knew John might have to do that by himself.
Tom said he was good to speak French.
This is not salt.
Did anyone see Tom here?
Tom told me that he thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room that I do.
He did not keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he was planning on that.
I doubt Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know Tom can speak French better than I can.
I doubt Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defense.
Tom told me he thought Mary was careful.
Tom was asleep on the live room sofa.
I found both Tom and Mary like romance novels.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I doubt Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone that he was ready to do that.
We'll go on a picnic if it's good tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone
It's not Tom who needs protection.
They said they're angry.
I think Tom might be able to do that.
Tom did that whenever he could.
They said their homes weren't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I wouldn't be able to do that.
I think we have more important things we should do now.
I think Tom and Mary have been in Boston at least once.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be sleeping.
Can anyone help me?
I know Tom is about the same age as your daughter.
I know that Tom is a very lucky man.
Tom thought I might not be allowed to do that myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom is easygoing.
I think Tom will be alone.
It looks like Tom looks like everyone.
I'm surprised tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary has to settle in her new flat.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you plan to do that.
They swore they would never do that.
Everyone stood there, shocked.
I'm waiting to hear why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I'm sorry that I wasn't as careful as I should.
Tom doesn't look so good.
Tom said he thought I should do that myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen.
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary is sleeping or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised that I did that, didn't you?
They wanted to fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I've seen Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know that the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like to do that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary right now.
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
You shouldn't just think Tom is guilty.
Watch yourself.
Mary said she wasn't planning on that.
Someone has to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know that Tom did that when he was third.
Tom said he doesn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both the Vegetarians.
Tom said I was the only one who thanked him.
Enough enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know that Tom did that?
I guess it's like that everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It's not until you lose your health that you realize its value.
That could have hit me.
They told me they're losing weight.
My house is not big.
I'm very sure Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know I was still planning to join the team, did you?
The bathroom was not very clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said he didn't think he would ever be able to convince Mary to go out with him.
Tom thought Mary would be the first to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was aggressive.
This is something I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music.
Tom said he thought he could do if he had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She's sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wanted to speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom hasn't got a prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know Tom knew I was the one who had to do that.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I left my umbrella in the phone booth.
I did a bad thing.
I doubt Tom would be interested in doing that.
I promised Tom that I'd do that.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's very good to be true.
Tom said that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to obey.
Curves are green.
I should never break up with Mary.
I wish I were in Australia right now.
Tom knew I would be early.
Tom tossed his dog some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that.
That's not just possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm very sure I can do that.
Tom says he and Mary will spend Christmas together.
Why did you fail to examine the entry?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom says he can't prove Mary did that.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were born.
Tom said he's happy you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was really meaning.
I know there's a lot of good food on the picnic.
Does anyone have any questions so far?
I doubt Tom is reluctant to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they'd come next week.
What are you referring to?
Tom said that he thought Mary was being funded by what was going on.
Everyone in the room did the same.
They're inseparable.
Tom didn't know you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised they would not do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must have done that last year.
Can you take a picture of me?
We should expect that to happen.
It would be wise to do that.
Tom told me he doesn't have a problem with that.
Tom said Mary should not go home by himself.
Tom has to be angry.
For how long have your head been hurting?
Thanks, buddy!
Tom said nobody was fired.
You think we should go where Tom wanted us to go instead of here?
He has earshee.
I don't think Tom wants to do that by himself.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.
Tom said that was Mary who told him he needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life in prison withoutparole.
I'm guessing that the gunshot I heard was the one who killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.
I know that Tom is a millionaire.
Tom said he thought that would be safe.
I don't think I'll allow Tom to do that.
No pain, no gain.
I admit I've done that.
I think Tom doesn't eat meat.
I hope we don't have problems with Tom.
Here's your bag.
This is the first time Tom has complained about the noise.
I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom is a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that.
Tom said he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I know we can't count on Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I think Tom won't be the last one to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom is downstairs.
I need to know that we can depend on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought he might not be allowed to do that.
I realize that it's not very likely to happen.
They say drugs are not safe.
I know it's very unlikely anyone can help me.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious man.
Tom said he thought it would be a big mistake to tell Mary what had happened.
Tom thought Mary would not cry.
This work is enough to break my back.
That would never happen if you did what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water temperature.
Does anyone have a kleenex?
Tom told us that he thought he could be a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom is a colossalc.
I wouldn't say anything.
Tom said he'd be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said he knew you could do that.
Tom and I are both wrong.
I think you still enjoy drinking beer.
I wonder if Tom and Mary could do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom is the person you should talk to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said I had to study French.
You're not responsible for that, are you?
You got a big head.
He's very smart.
I would never have hired Tom.
Do Tom know you've already done that?
Tom ate more than I did.
I didn't know that Tom was in Boston last week.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Tom said Mary's probably ready to do that.
Did anyone go to Australia with you?
Tom said he thought I would do that.
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that.
I hope it's enough food for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave any more early.
I know Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary are going to hurt if they're not careful.
Tom would have done that.
I didn't know that Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that.
I'd like to visit Boston again.
My time is taken with teaching and studying.
I think Tom is too proud.
I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary will not be able to do that.
They say they'll quit.
Tom is incometent.
Tom thinks Mary drinks like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
Tom and Mary said they told you.
Tom said he thinks Mary can't do that.
I know Tom is a golfer. Maybe he can teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew Tom would be able to do that without some help.
I suggest you don't go to Australia in the winter.
What else are you planning to do?
I think Tom understands everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom is talkative.
It's not my business.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're ready to help.
I think you'd like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary got back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew Tom was not a bad student.
It's impossible Tom will do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll find our way back to the campsite?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should quit while I was ahead.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandmother's texts faster than you.
Do both Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you did that for Tom.
I didn't think anyone saw what you did.
I wonder if I can help Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know this isn't hard.
I doubt Tom and Mary are not ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I thought Tom told you I would be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all week?
Tom said he didn't know that Mary was going to leave him.
You're not yet scared, are you?
I thought you'd cry.
The value of health cannot be overweight.
You'll suffer for that.
I don't think Tom knows exactly how much it will cost.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know that Tom is good.
Tom already knows Mary's planning on that.
Don't take your gloves off.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wasn't going to do that again.
Tom was able to show you how to do that.
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary was sick.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfriendly.
Put your pants on.
They said they were not ready to talk.
I know that Tom is not the one who's supposed to do that.
I admit I've rejected Tom since the first time I met him.
Is there a lot of Africans in Germany?
Where did you set the television guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It is true that the earth is round.
Tom could not help smiling.
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak French well.
Check that girl out.
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be handicapped.
I told Tom that you came to Australia.
Tom thinks it's a mistake.
I knew Tom was a reasonable man.
Tom thought Mary was downstairs.
I didn't want to admit that.
Tom said he was ready to do whatever was necessary.

Tom told me he was forgiven.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that tomorrow.
Tom knows there's only one way of action possible.
Tom and Mary said they tried to win.
They say they lost their keys.
I've decided never to do that again.
I didn't know you were dating tom.
I think Tom hasn't made a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary that they don't need to do that.
Good job, guys!
I know that Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to do that today.
Tom and Mary say they don't want to do that.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year.
Don't you know that everyone's talking about us?
Tom said that Mary knew he didn't want to do that until the next week.
I know Tom's house is for sale.
I don't think Tom is sad.
I don't think Tom will really win.
I wanted to do that with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone he was determined to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was hard.
Tom said he thought Mary might have done that by himself.
We wish we could do more to help.
Tom said he thought it would snow tonight.
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
Tom said he would look at it.
Tom said that was harder than he thought it would be.
You would love the movie.
They told me they don't really care what happened.
Tom's speech was not as long as Mary was.
I didn't know tom would be willing to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry I was worried about you.
Everyone looks scared but you.
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and he would end up telling them everything.
Did you read the book yesterday in French?
I'm a damaged doer.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could have gone.
Tom said he didn't think about the smell caused Mary.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
I thought you were a better chess player than this.
I'm glad to see that Tom is happy again.
I thought Tom's left already.
I knew Tom won't keep Mary from doing that.
I don't think we have a lot of time.
Tom said he was trying to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would do that for me.
Tom is the funnyest man I've ever met.
I doubt Tom really plan to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might not have to do that this week.
I know Tom knows he didn't need to do that.
To tell the truth, I'm not your father.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that with Mary.
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, isn't it?
I thought you could walk home.
Tom said he hopes Mary's trying to do that.
You like chocolate, right?
I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.
Tom says he knows Mary can't speak French very well.

Nobody knew that Tom was gonna do that.
That's right!
I thought I might need to do that.
I'm absolutely sure Tom doesn't have any brothers.
I think Tom was the one who wanted to do that.
I doubt that's not going to happen.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are really telling the truth.
Do you all think this is a good idea?
It must have been broken during the shipping.
They said they could not win.
Tom said he thought Mary was a good cook.
They didn't admit that they did that yet.
Everyone except Tom knew he didn't have to go to Boston.
I knew Tom knew why Mary had to do that yesterday.

If I could speak French better, I might have got that job.
Are you feeling OK today?

These turtles are not native to California.

Ya hafta smells the roses.

I'm really tired of living.

Do you have children?
Tom said he's happy that he didn't do that.
I wonder whether Tom is really finished.
I don't think anyone can do this.
Did you know Tom and Mary were still planning to do that?
Tom told me he thought Mary was too young to drive.
I'll come back.
I don't think Tom is nosy.
I would never have done that.
I believe we don't really need to do this.
Tom could have been faster than Mary if he tried harder.

In my opinion, you're wrong.

Tom said he thought Mary was a good cook.
Tom felt somebody touched his shoulder.

Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be nice.
Can you think of anyone who would want to kill Tom?
Tom said he thought he could do that for me.
I thought you enjoyed doing that.
You could have drowned.
Tom told Mary that he was happy to be doing what was going on.
We really need more American slang on Tatoeba, stat!
Tom said he didn't believe that Mary was really planning to go with us.
I know Tom would do that for me.
I don't think the weather will clear anytime soon.
Tom and I look like swimming.
Tom said he didn't want to go to dance with Mary.
Tom said the pain started three months ago.
Tom told me he hoped Mary would go there the time we got there.
Tom pretended he didn't notice that Mary was staring at him.
Tom thought he had to help Mary.
I'm going to New York next week.
It is normally a difficult language.
They realized that they needed to do that.
I'm sure Tom needs to do that again.
Tom must have been tortured.
Last night I kicked.
Everyone here except me has done that.
Tom is almost as high as Mary is.
Tom told me he thought Mary was upset.
We need to protect our children.
I think you've already read this evidence.
I don't think you should do that until this afternoon.
Tom said he hoped that Mary would like to like the gift he was planning to give her.
I thought Tom didn't like you.
I was surprised that Tom didn't need to do the same thing I needed to do.
I thought Tom was probably winning.
I can't help laugh at him.
I don't think I really have to do that.
I know Tom is a heavy sleeper.
I think Tom will call you.
It was the first time I visited the museum.
Tom said he hopes Mary won't let John drive.
What are you gonna do with that money?
Why are you planning on that?
I'm sorry I couldn't get you soon.
Treatment!
We're sorry that it happened.
I didn't notice that Tom was doing that.
Tom is about three years old than Mary.
It's important we do that right.
I think Tom's just pretending to be asleep.
I promise I won't cry.
Tom said he thought I wouldn't have to do that myself.
I doubt Tom is frustrated.
Tom and Mary told me they needed some money.
I always knew Tom could win.
You're welcome.
Tom showed me his stamp collection.
We're here.
Both Tom and Mary don't speak French.
What you said doesn't make sense.
They told me they'd join us later.
I doubt Tom and Mary are gonna hate this.
Tom said she wanted Mary and I wouldn't go out by ourselves after darkness.
We could not see the top of the mountain.
They told me they'd be back soon.
You should have been able to do that without Tom's help.
Someone's waiting for us in the lobby.
I knew Tom was planning to tell Mary to do that.
I've lost three kilos.
The same thing must have happened to Tom.
I know Tom is almost the height as I am.
Tom didn't read everything carefully as he should.
We know Tom is impossible to do that.
I knew Tom went to this school.
I'm afraid we'll have to start again.
I'm so sorry this has happened.
That's a interesting claim.
You weren't surprised that I didn't have to do that, were you?
I'm familiar with this subject.
I don't think anyone really thought Tom was rich as he said he was.
She's not enough old to get a driver's license.
His dream has become a reality.
They promised they would do that tomorrow.
I think Tom and Mary were born in Australia.
Why do you think Tom would do that?
I might go out if the rain drops up.
I don't think Tom enjoys hiking.
Tom could have been present at today's meeting, but he didn't want to be, so he wasn't.
Tom and Mary say they'll never give up.
It may not be hard to do as you think it will be.
Kids, listen!
They say they have no vices.
No one in my family is a musician.
Tom admits he was weak.
Tom said he was happy you were able to do that when you were in Boston.
Tom and Mary think they know what to do.
I don't think it's a good idea.
I know that Tom is picky.
The wound hasn't been healed yet.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who's able to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would do that.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
Tom said he thought Mary was the last one to do that.
I should have paid more attention in biology classes.
Tom said he thought he was too young to do that.
You're not taking it, are you?
Is there anywhere we can talk privately about this?
I guess I could try.
They're not like people who say they're.
I don't think I'll be busy next week.
I don't think I'm the man you're looking for.
I'm far away from happiness.
I don't think Tom has any friends living in Boston.
Both Tom and Mary complained about John.
I know you're not serious.
Tom said he never heard of me.
Tom said he didn't think Mary knew how to drive.
I never said that!
Take a great weekend.
I doubt Tom and Mary have already left Australia.
Tom thought it was gonna hurt.
It's not worth much.
This is real hard.
Tom's gonna be surprised if you don't do that.
Tom knew Mary was with John.
I promise I'll be back soon.
Tom said Mary should not stay at the party so long.
They put their boots on.
I thought you came to see Tom.
This should have been done a long time ago.
I don't think it's probably gonna come over this night's time.
I don't mince words.
Tom said he thought he'd have to do that tomorrow.
Tom should have done that week ago.
Mary said she wasn't planning to go.
Tom told Mary that she should go home.
I think Tom's still moved.
I should have kept going.
I thought Tom was hungry.
Tom thinks if he tried a little harder, he could win the race.
Tom's lawyer wasn't surprised when the jury found him not guilty.
What's the real reason Tom didn't want to buy that?
Tom thought everyone at school knew he was arrested.
It's not something that I'm very good at.
I thought it was true.
The books were so valuable that they were handled with the greatest care.
You should have rejected the invitation.
I didn't know that Tom told Mary that he couldn't do that.
I know Tom is a teacher here.
Tom thought he forgot to tell Mary what to do.
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't pleased.
I understand no one wants to help us.
Tom and Mary told me that they thought I should lose some weight.
I know you don't even know.
If you want this pen, I'll pay it to you.
I know that Tom doesn't know why you didn't do that.
I think it would be difficult to do that.
Tom told me he thought you could do that.
Tom doesn't know that Mary was the one who did that.
I know Tom is a bit more taller than I.
I don't remember!
I should have been a movie star.
Tom said he hopes you won't go home by yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary used to play the guitar in John's band.
If it were possible, someone would have done it by now.
I think Tom still needs to do that.
Tom said he didn't need your permission to do that.
Tom's eating.
Tom said Mary was willing to help you.
I know Tom is more beautiful than me.
Tom and Mary said they're happy to help.
Tom knew he was busy on October 20th.
I think I can do that better than you can.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are worried.
Tom and Mary said they could not wait.
Tom said the team's still confident.
I wonder if Tom wanted to sing.
I don't think Tom is unconscious.
I know Tom can't play the guitar.
Tom said he didn't think you should ask Mary to do that.
He's a passive-aggressive teacher.
Tom said that he thought she was in Australia.
Tom doubts that Mary can swim.
It's not easy for you, is it?
Tom could have been one responsible for what happened, but I don't think he was.
Tom knew I was uncomfortable.
Tom told me he'd be back soon.
It's obvious tom wants to do that.
I think it's a risk that anyone would take.
I'm sorry I forced you to do that.
I thought you said you did it instead of yourself.
Tom said he thought Mary would be scared.
Tom doesn't want Mary to know he doesn't know how to do that.
Tom vehemently refused to do that.
Tom should have told Mary that she was doing that wrong way.
Call me!
You should have told Tom how you felt.
We'll consider your suggestions.
Food is too bad for health.
The paint's drying.
Tom may be lost.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is.
Hi, my name's Tom!
Tom said he never wanted to marry.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would do that.
Tom's still dating the same girl he was dating three years ago.
You're not that easy away from me, Tom.
Tom will give us everything we asked for.
Tom and Mary said they were supportive.
You're a drug addict like me!
I think I don't deserve it.
I thought Tom wasn't here.
I'm speechless.
Tom was surprised Mary didn't do that.
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
Thank you for coming.
I doubt Tom will leave anytime soon.
Both Tom and Mary will go.
I thought you asked Tom to do that.
Don't hang up!
I probably sing better than Tom.
Tom is hard.
Didn't you know there was a good chance that this would happen?
I wonder if Tom would be at Mary's party tonight.
Tom is the only one in our office who doesn't speak French.
It's not expensive.
I never thought I had a chance to do that.
I know that's hard to do.
Tom must have missed something.
I know someone had to do that.
Tom said he hoped he would be able to win.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
It's not a big deal.
Tom thinks he's in love.
It's not necessary for Tom to do that by itself.
Tom said Mary had to do that.
Tom didn't know Mary used to live in Australia.
I wonder if Tom still thinks Mary must do that.
I'm planning to send Tom a birthday present.
I don't speak French as frantically as you.
Tom has given me many things.
I know that Tom didn't know why you wanted him to do that.
They said they weren't sure what to do.
I should listen to you.
Do you have a umbrella I can borrow?
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind.
Feder keeps his service in love at 2-2.
We should study harder.
Tom said he'd die rather than that.
I think I'm going to have to tell Tom everything.
I know Tom didn't know who didn't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom is biased.
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to do that.
Mary says she's planning tomorrow.
I must have misunderstood.
Tom sheeped Mary a birthday cake.
I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she should do that.
Tom said he didn't have time to answer all my questions.
Tom said it was simple.
I don't think Tom knows how badly Mary was hurt.
I think we're free to go.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I know you're not enough to believe that.
I don't think anyone could do that.
Tom agreed to have our children babysit the next week.
Tom said he was sure Mary would not win.
Tom said he's not sure Mary can take care of herself.
Tom lived in Australia for three years when he was a child.
I doubt that Tom really plans to do that this week.
Is it true that Tom tried to hang himself?
Who are you calling stupid?
I'm calling my brother.
There's a good chance to do that for us.
I knew Tom wouldn't hurt me.
Tom was not completely honest.
You could just tell me.
Tom was just pretending he didn't understand French.
Tom said Mary was willing to do that for you.
I thought that was interesting.
Tom's sorry.
Tom told me he would not be in Boston the next week.
Tom let me know he was planning to stay in Australia for three weeks.
Tom and Mary said they always did that.
I can't do that!
I don't think Tom knows what Mary will do this evening.
I know why you didn't do that.
There's no hot water.
I like grapes and vegetables.
Tom plan to stay with us when he comes to Boston.
I don't think you need to tell Tom what Mary did.
Tom thought it over a few days.
Tom works in a store not far away from where he lives.
You're very brave.
Tom said he understand why Mary might not want to do that.
Forget it.
Tom said more than he should.
I thought Tom wouldn't like the book Mary gave him.
Tom said he thought Mary would not do that today.
Tom was not the one who told me that Mary didn't want to do that.
I hope things remain peaceful.
I can rip you apart with my big hands.
I thought Tom might be angry with you.
I don't think Tom is Mary's boyfriend.
Tom said he thought he should do that.
Tom and Mary told me they're safe.
Tom thought he heard his name called.
We don't believe that's true.
This is a song I learned when I was a kid.
The road is long.
Tom's a good carpenter.
Tom said Mary was probably in Australia the next week.
It's going to be difficult to do.
I thought I tried that again.
Tom will be very disappointed if you don't eat the salad he made.
We're both from Boston.
I don't think Tom knows I'm Mary's boyfriend.
You lied to her!
I'm not sure, but I think Tom wants to be a teacher.
I thought it was a interesting story.
They put their skulls down.
Tom and Mary said they were sure they could do that.
I think Tom would not like to do that.
I must have made a mistake.
Tom told everyone he decided to do that.
Tom told Mary that he was not planning to stay in Boston too long.
I know Tom is a really successful musician.
I didn't think anyone did that.
I didn't want Tom to know I wasn't going to do that.
Both Tom and I need help.
Are you also hungry?
I doubt we were ever in any real danger.
Did you know Tom was gonna win?
They say they don't think they're snore.
The doctor said that this ailment is possible.
Tom told me he'd do that if I did that.
I knew Tom would be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary said they didn't mean to hurt you.
I don't think Tom will come to school today.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to say.
Is there any chance you could help me get them?
Are you sure that's what you want to do?
I know someone who can do that for you.
I thought I heard a mouse in the kitchen.
I know Tom won't make Mary do that.
Tom put on his glasses.
There is nothing God can do.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't impressed.
I thought about it a lot.
Tom said he thought the financial was in bad shape.
I was living in Boston when I was the third.
How long was that?
I think Tom is lovely.
I'm buying a new car.
In 1497, John Cabot exploded Canada.
Tom and Mary told me they cried.
I didn't think Tom was happy that happened.
Do you think it would be hard for you to do that?
Tom told me he likes that.
I know you're not like that.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't going to win.
I didn't think Tom would be fired for that.
I plan on that tomorrow.
Tom knew he shouldn't say anything right away.
Tom and Mary say they'll sing.
There's a park near my house.
I hope I'll be given another chance.
You'll know the truth one day.
Tom told me he won't come to school tomorrow.
We found that Tom was a thief.
Tom had no intention of returning to Boston.
Mary made her husband breakfast.
It's not still bedtime.
I think Tom may be able to do that.
I must have forgotten it.
You know yourself.
Don't say anything.
I would have done it at that time.
Tom and I are both busy.
Tom told me he left his wife.
It's probably going to be hard for Tom to win.
I knew Tom was doing that.
I admitted I didn't do what Tom told me to do.
They said they weren't retired.
Tom says he's not planning on that.
Nobody else complained.
Tom told me Mary was very hungry.
Tom and Mary think they understand women.
I didn't know Tom was trans.
They say they're gonna beat you up.
I think you should let Tom know that you can't speak French.
I knew Tom didn't care about Mary.
I didn't know Tom had a house in Australia.
I can't stand this heat.
Tom and Mary say they don't care.
I'm just as surprised as everyone else.
They thought they were cute.
I don't think that's what it does.
I didn't know you were planning to do that today.
Why's Tom mad at Mary?
They say they want something to eat.
Tom help anyone who asks for help.
I know that Tom is a member.
I doubt so serious that Tom will be here.
That book is very old.
No one of us plan to stay here so long.
I know that Tom is not a dental student.
I thought you were supposed to do that right now.
Maybe Tom doesn't know he's probably not fired.
Tom wanted to keep walking, but Mary insisted that they stop and rest.
I don't think Tom knows how to dance.
Since it rained, I did not go.
Tom knows I'm at home.
Four times two is eight.
They said they'd think about it.
Tom said he was asked to help.
I never thought Tom would talk to me again.
It's not very airy today.
Tom won't be here until 2:30.
Tom is the only one I know who has been to Australia.
I promise I won't tell anyone what you did.
They put their pigs on.
Hurry up, Tom.
You should have spoken more policies.
If you were there, we would have a good time together.
Tom said he wasn't happy here.
I'm at a loss of words.
Tom and Mary said they'd like to do that.
Tom and I are both busy right now.
They said they felt the manipulated.
I don't think Tom would be moved to do that.
Tom said it didn't look like Mary had a good time.
Tom told Mary he was not interested in doing that.
You should have told Tom and Mary that they didn't need to do that anymore.
I knew Tom wouldn't cry.
I think Tom would like to live in Australia.
I thought I could handle it myself, but I couldn't.
It's not yet evening.
Tom thought everyone knew Mary was going to do that.
I know that Tom didn't know why Mary was doing that by himself.
Tom said he could swim at least as well as Mary.
That's the most funny movie I've ever seen.
Tom plan to go soon.
You're not upset, are you?
Tom said he thought Mary was planning to go to Boston with him.
Let's go to the park where it's not noise.
I think Tom has to do that.
I thought I wouldn't go long.
Where are you going?
Tom and Mary said they'd attacked their visa.
She dreamed a happy dream last night.
Both Tom and Mary are very tired.
I thought both Tom and Mary were under thirty.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know what to do.
I have to admit that I'm a little worried.
Tom stopped his hands with the towel that Mary handed him.
I think Tom's record speaks for himself.
You have the same rights as everyone else.
Tom and Mary said they planned to stay where they were.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom said he wouldn't try that again.
Tom said he thought he would not be able to do that until October.
Tom said Mary is sleeping.
Tom said he never left early.
I doubt Tom would be that stupid.
I'm not sure I can do it.
I don't think Tom would ever think about it.
How did you know that Tom couldn't do that?
Tom's not on the good terms with his family.
Tom can see things that Mary cannot.
Tom said he hoped he could figure out how to do that.
Both Tom and Mary were quiet for a long time.
I'm starting to remember it.
If I had the money, I would buy this computer immediately.
We're already mounting it.
Tom and Mary said they would make it at time.
I don't think Tom understand how well Mary can speak French.
Tom told everyone that he was happy to do what was going to happen.
The price of rice rose by three percent.
They say they've been asked to help.
Tom knows he has no choice.
No one should die.
Tom would have done that himself if he knew how.
I hope Tom knows he doesn't need to do that.
He's piss.
I would have done that for you if I had more time.
I knew Tom was not in Boston.
Tom said he thought it would be raining on Monday.
You think Tom would like to do that?

Tom said he loves that kind of work.
I know Tom didn't know who wanted to do that.
Tom said Mary was wrong.
They told me that they needed money.
Tom said that he thought Mary was planning to go to Australia with him.
Wait!
I didn't tell Tom I grew up in Australia.
Tom did that for the purpose.
I thought Tom had a party last night.
I know that Tom didn't know you needed to do that.
Tom already plan to do that.
Who is the photographer?
I knew Tom was a gun owner, but I didn't know he had so many guns.
I didn't understand.
I'm lucky I'm still able to do that.
They put their phones away.
I think Tom would help us if he was there.
They said they were thrilled.
They're doctors.
Tom and Mary should have been awake.
Tom and Mary said they didn't plan to go together.
They said they were bore.
Tom could have given me more money.

I'll watch television.
I don't think Tom knows when the meeting will start.
Tom and Mary let us know they won't do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much money was stolen.
Tom and Mary are planning to stay in Boston for a few days.
Keep the grass off.
Tom and Mary said they felt lonely.
Tom said we should be patient.
Is it true Tom used to live in Australia?
As a rule, we have three meals a day.
Is that true Tom thinking I believe that?
I'm playing volleyball now.
They say they can't help.
No one knows that Tom didn't do that.
I don't think anyone does that.
Tom said Mary wasn't one responsible for what happened.
Tom said he thought Mary was hungry.
I thought Tom was with Mary.
I knew Tom would not be moved to do that.
It could have happened to anyone.

I'm a woman.
You know you did the right thing.
Tom probably should go home now.
Tom said Mary was probably early.
Tom told me he thought Mary was fine.
I know you're not doing that right now.
We already know you did that.
I think Tom would be a cooperative.
Tom knows he has to do something, but he's not sure what.
I'm sorry tom thinks like that.
Tom said he hoped he could win the race.

We're a team.
Do Tom and Mary know if they would leave?

Tom plan to go, too.

Tom said he was supposed to be able to do that.
Tom's happy.
Both Tom and Mary are maintained.
Tom said he thought Mary could not be allowed to do that by himself.
I'm praying.
Tom told me he thought Mary was satisfied.
I don't think Tom knows the whole story.
I don't even think Tom saw me.
Put your shirt on.
The same for me.
I'm the first musician in my family.
Some people say true love does not exist.
I'm not very good to play people up soon.
Tom told me I could use his computer.
The first person I met in Australia was Tom.
Everyone but Tom knew he didn't need to stay in Boston.
Tom and Mary told me they'd look at it.
They know that Tom means business.
Tom said Mary knew John might be allowed to do that after his birthday.
I don't think that was the problem.
They told me that they felt good.
Tom said he really enjoyed dancing with Mary.
Tom said that's not the only reason why Mary wants to do that.
It's unfortunate that happened.
Tom told me he thought Mary was downstairs.
I know Tom knows he should not do that.
Tom and Mary are planning to take pictures tomorrow.
This man is not my husband.
Tom said he didn't believe that.
I'm very sure Tom didn't say I was going to do that.
Tom must have been very tired when he got home.
I'm very sure Tom can't speak French.
There's no chance to help us.
I don't think you can eat that.
Tom said he'd try to do that.
I thought it was hilarious.
Tom works in a store not far away from where he lives.
I thought you didn't want to talk about it.
I don't know anyone except Tom.
Tom told me he was faster than Mary.
I don't think Tom's still upset.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was fired.
It's not a bad plan.
Tom knew you were planning on that?
Tom convinced me that you were the best person for the job.
Tom thought Mary would not do that for him.
That water's not cold.
I think Tom stayed in Boston last summer.
How could anyone vote for someone like that is beyond me.
They said they were busy.
I know Tom is in his room packing his suitcase.
Do you really think you can convince Tom to buy that for you?
I don't think anyone saw us do that.
Tom said you speak French.
I should have gone to the dentist last week.
They told me they're shy.
I don't think Tom is adopted.
I swear I'm not high.
Tom and Mary gave me their old car.
Tom said he didn't see Mary for a long time.
Both Tom and I know you did that.
Tom told Mary I was broken.
I know that Tom and Mary both are sick.
I can't understand why anyone wants to do that.
Tom said he's interested in learning how to do that.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary what to do.
They still hope that they can do that.
Tom said he ran out of the way.
"Are anyone with you?" "No, I was alone."
Don't pretend you're sorry. I know you're not.
Tom told everyone he was reluctant to do that.
This box is too heavy!
I thought you said you wanted to go to Boston.
I met someone who knows Tom yesterday.
I know you can't get away with this.
When someone knocks at the door, my dog starts barking.
Both Tom and Mary have the same problem.
There's no way you can do that by yourself.
I'm afraid something wrong with Tom.
The bill was hard to calculate.
I want to know who's coming with us.
I've never met anyone like you before.
It would have been hard to do that.
Tom may be ready to do that.
Tom will try to help Mary do that.
It could have been worse.
Tom think that's not a good idea.
I'm sorry that I didn't tell Tom the truth.
Tom and I didn't go to the meeting yesterday.
How did you not come to the party?
You think Tom is already retired?
I wonder if Tom still remembers how to do that.
Didn't you know that Tom used to live Boston?
I don't think it will rain, but I'll take a umbrella in case.
Tom promised he'd tell us.
Tom said he thought there was no need to hurry.
Both Tom and I are still high school students.
You're making a big mistake.
Tom says he saw a ghost.
Tom thinks Mary won't be alone.
Tom and Mary said they would help.
Did the umbrella you found belong to Tom?
Tom should have done much better.
I know Tom's almost at home on Monday.
I think Tom really hates you.
I know Tom would like to do that by himself.
Tom said he was retiring next October.
I didn't know that Tom played the trumpet.
Do you think it will rain this weekend?
I know Tom probably didn't do what he was supposed to do.
I don't remember asking you to do that.
There's no way I'm gonna let you do that.
Tom told everyone that he was alone.
I wonder whether Tom is still busy.
What is our CEO name?
I know you're worried about Tom.
I thought I did very well.
Tom admits he was worried.
Nobody could hear what Tom was saying.
Tom said he'd visit Mary in Australia the next summer.
They're good queens.
Not everyone is ready.
There's going to be a storm.
Tom must have been questionable.
Where's the meeting going to be?
I think Tom is wrong.
Tom said Mary thought John wouldn't want to do that.
I thought it would be easy to do that.
Tom says she hopes Mary knows she has to do that.
It's not as cold today as it was yesterday.
That's not a game for kids.
I hope you'll wait for us.

I think Tom would be hurt if you did that.
Tom and Mary thought they'd find other jobs.
Tom said I should not leave early.
I know I should stay and help.
Don't look at me.
I doubt Tom and Mary were planning to do that tomorrow.
I didn't know how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I know Tom does that well.
Tom said nothing changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night.
I know Tom knows I needed to do that.
Stay out of this.
I know Tom's afraid he'll get fired.
If I were you, I would call the doctor.
I wasn't very hungry.
I've done everything you asked me to do.
Do you have a tie I can borrow?
I didn't think we could find anyone who could do that for us.
Tom is not an angel.
I think Tom is mad.
That sounds strange.
Tom is driving over to Mary's apartment to give her something.
Tom said he thought Mary would wait.
Tom said he didn't think that smell caused Mary.
Tom said he's ready to do that for us.
Can you believe Tom's still only the third?
Tom sent Mary his picture.
Tom already knows that Mary doesn't plan to be here today.
They say they've never eaten Thai food.
I think Tom and Mary have never been to Boston.
They're playing chess.
I thought I heard someone singing.
I heard Tom plan to move to Australia.
It's not like hot here as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I belong here.
Nobody saw Tom leave.
I knew Tom used to live in Boston.
Tom ran home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he could win.
Tom had no problems with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know you're not misguiding me for someone else?
You should've refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
I'm starting to believe we'll never convince Tom that he's wrong.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Tom should never have been left out in prison.
His train arrives at the main station at 5.50 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said that Mary thought that John might have to do that by himself.
I know what I would do.
He didn't need umbrella.
Tom and Mary were not at home when we went to visit them.
Tom thinks I need to do that today.
Tom admits he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had the chance.
Tom told me you were with him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom and I didn't know we were those who were supposed to do that.
I'm so tired that I can walk hard.
They felt that they needed to do something.
I read many foreign languages, but I don't speak.
You set a trap.
I should add more salt.
I know that's not what you want.
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to marry.
I think Tom is smashed.
Tom and Mary say they'll never do that.
I think Tom is sorry.
You were skinny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could have got home himself.
Both Tom and Mary know who you are.
Mary said she didn't plan on doing that by herself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were uncompressed.
Tom hasn't told us what he needs to do.
I know you probably don't need to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remember where we first met.
If you had helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said he expected Mary to get back to Boston on October 20th.
Tom said he thought he might be needed to do that again.
Tom think you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim.
I knew that Tom told Mary that he couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize they're ignoring.
If Tom left at 2:30, he would have got here now.
Tom and Mary said they would do it.
There's no doubt Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom has decided to stay in Australia for another three days.
Tom said he thought I was unconscious.
I should have stayed and helped Tom.
Tom said he thought I'd be able to do that.
I figured Tom would be scared.
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here.
I wonder if it's snow tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom is pleased.
I'm frying fish.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Slow down.
Tom would have done that until now if he was really planning to do it.
I know Tom could do that if he really needed it.
We'll never know.
Tom admits that he killed Mary.
Didn't you know that your taillights were not working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom's never gonna hurt anyone again.
I'm learning Esperanto very fast.
You're not gonna get in trouble for help, are you?
I heard that women spent more shoes than men.
I think Tom's gonna be excited.
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
Tom said he would take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do whatever he wants to do.
I thought you were going to fix that.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told he's not allowed to do that.
They say they're unsuccessful.
I know that Tom didn't know he would not be able to do that.
Tom should have told me before.
I have to go to the toilet.
Both men apologized to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John will actually do that.
They say that they also need to do that.
I know tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me they would help me.
I don't think I'll ever be able to buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they're snore.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tom said he found something.
A business is not a charity.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had ever been to Australia.
I don't think Tom is like good-looking as John is.
Tom said he thought that prices were too high on that store.
I don't think anyone argues that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't remember.
Tom said he hoped he would be able to do that today.
You knew everyone at the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unfamiliar.
I'm sorry it happened like this.
I know Tom is not afraid to walk through wood alone.
Both Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without some help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
Nobody asked me whether I liked it or not.
Many old people can't keep up these days with time.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know that Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he decided to do that.
It's a kind of cat.
Tom thought Mary would probably not do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
Tom rejected that he accepted the money.
Tom said he thought that would not be a good idea.
I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was broken.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sad.
Can't this wait until morning?
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
We know that it won't happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his neck loudly.
I think Tom is unprejudified.
I'm afraid I lost it.
Tom said Mary was probably a grumpy.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they were.
I know Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do that today.
Don't talk about business while we're eating.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard.
I hope Tom gets adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She has to be taken to the hospital.
I would have helped you if you asked.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
It's not a drill.
Tom should have done that long ago.
I think Tom slept all night.
I wonder whether Tom is upset.
Tom said that he knew he wouldn't let him do that at school.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes that.
Tom would have done that for Mary if he had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something's not right yet.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked riders.
I know Tom is not planning to go to Boston with you.
Tom said he's not sure Mary has to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be able to talk to Mary in that way.
Is it true that Tom and Mary plan to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know that you didn't want to do that by yourself.
Tom said he thought that would be fun.
I think you'll find that it was Tom's fault.
I thought it was rather ingenious.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are going to do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary were those who did that?
Are you still planning on doing that with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
His younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know when you said you would be there, but I wasn't able to be there at that time.
I don't think they're complaining.
You and I both know that's not true.
Let's think that's gonna happen.
Tom told everyone he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone he could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was true.
It's probably that Tom will come.
I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
I didn't think anyone tried that before.
You should have made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom said it looks like Mary had a really hard time doing that.
I'm learning old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could have done that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard to get along.
They said they were very drunk.
You could have told me before.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was proud.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are in doubt.
I know that Tom never does that anymore.
Tom says he only swears when it's absolutely necessary.
I don't think Tom is high.
Tom was drunk and said things he should not say.
Tom said he thought Mary was interested in the basketball.
Tom told me that he thought this book was interesting.
Tom thought everyone knew he couldn't do that.
Tom said he planned to go on October 20th.
They said they're just doing good.
Hostilities reversed between the two powers.
The only reason that Tom came to Australia was because everyone else in his family did.
I did that if I could.
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning on that.
Tom thought everyone at school knew he was arrested.
Tom wanted to know how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he saw Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said he thought Mary would be able to do that.
I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary to do that.
Everyone knows Tom can't speak French very well.
My discoveries suggest that it's not the case.
Tom found the watch he lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Someone must leave the window open.
I know that Tom is a messy man.
I'm sorry, sir.
I know Tom knew Mary was planning to do that.
Tom was just stating clearly.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know she wasn't happy.
Tom said he would be able to do that in a few hours.
No one doubt you'll be able to pass the test.
Where's everybody?
How did you feel?
Fortunately, the brave.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still looking at me.
I thought Tom heard us.
It's not compulsory.
I hope no one comes.
What color was tom wearing?
Tom and Mary would not ask you to do that for them if they could find anyone else to do it for them.
Tom said he'd walk Mary's home.
It's hard for Tom to win.
We should hire someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was uncompressed.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me that he was too tired to study.
Where is your luggage?
Both my parents are musicians.
I live in Greoningen.
How do we know that's not true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said he thought Mary would be able to help him do that tomorrow.
I know Tom is a cubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom's gonna be ready to talk to me.
Tom said he was happy Mary was able to win.
I didn't think you would be able to get Tom to that.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, very little German.
Tom thought something was going to happen.
I thought that was what you wanted.
I know it's very unlikely someone knows me.
Where is Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I doubt Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I enjoy playing volleyball.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
Tom said he was unable to win.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that anytime soon.
There's a chance Tom won't want to go to Boston with us.
It's not enough to know only one language.
She's a blend girl.
Tom think we can't do that.
I know Tom is a better Tenis player than I.
Tom said he's not mad.
Tom may have done the same thing that Mary did.
I know that Tom is a sophomore.
Tom definitely knew he should not eat that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that until Somalia.
Tom should never have tried that by himself.
How's your father?
My son is not a snob.
I would've let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was harder than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that alone.
I wonder whether it would really be hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you've experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said that Mary knew she might not have to do that again.
They swear they won't do that again.
I'm not really planning to do that.
I know Tom will let you do that.
Tom said Mary would do that.
They said they won't do that.
Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John.
Tom said he thought there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would like it.
You're not the only one Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary wasn't done that yet.
They put their notebooks away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn't know that Tom could actually do that.
I didn't say I used to live in Australia.
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary.
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he would.
Tom said he thought Mary was over 30.
We went up to the Apparel Stalls to reach two floors.
I don't think Tom is funny.
Tom think he's going to die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know that Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they would be happy to help.
Tom and I want to go.
I didn't know you told me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I'd be able to do that for Tom.
Tom promised he never made such a mistake again.
Don't you think we should talk to Tom about this?
Tom told me he thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me that he still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't sweat the little things.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it's a very common problem.
Are you sure this'll work?
I'm afraid I'll be tied up all night.
I know you can hear me.
You seemed unhappy to do that.
Tom told Mary that he thought she was doing it wrong, but she didn't care what he thought.
The doctor is no longer available.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first-time offender.
I promise you that won't happen.
Tom said that Mary thought she might need to do that.
Tom said he would never try that again.
I don't think it worked.
Don't forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom has given me a lot of things.
I know Tom is a few years old than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom admits that he lied to me.
Tom and Mary have told John they don't plan to stay at home all day.
Tom doesn't know I still have this.
We're not absolutely sure what we're supposed to do.
We both love Tom.
Tom said he expects you try your best to do that.
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what everyone else wanted to do.
Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that to this evening.
I don't think I know the man who's playing drums.
This old man has liver spaces on his skin.
Tom and Mary vowed they'd never do that.
Give me that candy.
Tom didn't seem to be aware of what he needed to do.
There's no time to explain.
Tom didn't realize he had to leave.
They were scared.
Tom and Mary say they can't find their hats.
I graduated from Kyoto University.
You're comparing apps and oranges!
Tom said there was still a lot of work to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was embarrassed.
Tom said he thought he was arrested.
Tom and Mary told me they were worn out.
I heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to see Mary anymore.
They're living in a fantasy world.
They said they thought I was charming.
I didn't know that Tom was in the hospital.
I don't think you'll have a lot of fun doing that.
I doubt Tom doesn't do that as often as he used to.
I was surprised that Tom didn't know how to do that.
I'm planning to quit lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was scared.
Tom has already told me that he's decided to go to Boston next summer.
That doesn't make sense.
They say they're dying.
Tom offered to pay me some money.
You think Tom would let me do that?
Tom had no idea what she was doing.
Tom told everyone that he needed to do that.
I don't think Tom is a native French speaker.
They said they weren't planning to go.
They say they've taught French.
I doubt Tom and Mary are interesting.
I know Tom knows I don't need to do that.
You have to help Tom.
Tom told us he had a headache.
The bomb was defuted just minutes before it exploded.
Tom and Mary told me they won, but they didn't.
I'm glad to hear it!
Tom and Mary say they don't know any French.
I don't think we'll find anyone who can help us do that.
You should've refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't like tom dating Mary.
Tom said that's not the main reason why Mary should do that.
Tom doesn't have a car or Mary.
I'm a cat.
I know you don't do that anymore.
Tom said he wasn't different.
Tom admitted what he said was wrong.
Tom could have been scared.
Who do you think you asked me to give it to you?
I'm just sick.
I hope I get a raise.
Tom said he didn't think we should think about it even.
Tom said he would have come if we invited him.
I don't think I'll do that.
Tom said he might cry.
It's Sunday.
Tom told me he wasn't tired.
I didn't think anyone really thought Tom was busy.
I think you know we have to do that today.
I didn't think Tom would actually do that.
I knew Tom would leave early.
Tom said he thought that Mary understood French.
Tom said he needed my help, so I helped him.
I don't think anyone lives in this house in a long time.
Tom denied he stole the money.
Tom said he hasn't decided what he will do.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't like to go to Boston.
Tom said he thought tomorrow would be a sunny day.
Tom is really drunk.
I'm absolutely sure that that's not going to happen.
Everyone was there except Tom.
I thought you promised to give that to Tom.
I thought you saw Tom this morning.
I think Tom was supposed to be here.
Tom and Mary said they've recovered completely.
I didn't know you weren't planning on that by yourself.
I don't think there's any way out of here.
There is no rising without a thorn.
Tom thought Mary probably didn't know John spoke French.
You know I won't do that.
I think we all know that's a bad idea.
I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do.
Tom was probably about 13 years old at that time.
Tom and Mary said they were tickled.
Tom said he would not be able to help the garden today.
I wonder how Tom knew I would be here.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
I'm not sure Tom would let me do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was.
So, where's the problem?
Tom didn't think she was beautiful.
He will have to do that work again.
I know Tom didn't know anyone who was able to do that.
Only new veg is sold here.
I believe this is not a good idea.
Tom has already been asked not to do that.
Here's your change.
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew long ago.
When was the last time you asked someone for help?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny.
I know Tom's angry.
I didn't meet any new one today.
This lake is the deepest in Japan.
I knew Tom was planning to do that.
Tom and I don't speak French.
I thought you were ready.
I know why Mary didn't like to do that.
I didn't think Tom was happy that happened.
They said they were very tired.
You're not enough old to get a driver's license, are you?
I don't think there's any harm in telling you now.
I thought you said you did that on Monday.
Everyone here knows Tom is in Boston.
Tom denied he met Mary last week.
That's not why I'm here.
Australia is a seliamentary republic in the middle-Europe and consists of nine Bundeslander.
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall.
They said they're not 30.
I didn't think Tom really needed to do that yesterday.
I thought Tom was back already.
Tom said Mary knew she might not be allowed to do that unless John did it with her.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were happy.
Tom said that Mary thought John might be needed to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I thought Mary was cute.
Tom thinks Mary will not be able to do that by myself.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy.
Did Tom say he stayed in Australia?
Tom said he paid for everything.
They told me they weren't alone.
I don't think I can finish the job alone.
Tom said Mary is not safe.
Tom said I saw a thinner more than the last time he saw me.
They said they'd see me tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was concerned.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's gonna do this afternoon.
Tom paid someone to do that.
I thought Tom would be a cooperative.
Tom told me he was safe.
Tom said I should go to Boston with you.
They think they know what to do.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be scared.
Tom and I are very proud of you.
I knew that Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked him.
We can't blame Tom is normal.
Tom's amused.
Tom should never have tried that alone.
Tom and Mary said they'd never do that.
I'm taller more than him.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was a servitude.
Tom said he probably wouldn't want Mary to do that on a cold day like this today.
The teacher's room and the gym are under reunion.
You think there's any chance you'll be able to do that?
Tom set his glass down.
You'd think that would have impressed Tom.
This is the first time I bought a newspaper in this city.
That's a good question.
Without water, we cannot exist.
Tom definitely understands that we all need to attend today's meeting.
Tom and Mary said they didn't agree with that.
I know Tom will be able to help us do that.
I had three hours before lunch.
Tom said he appreciated Mary's help.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
You're the only one who can protect them.
Can anyone explain this to me?
Did you know Tom was going to be in Boston all week?
Tom and Mary told me they wanted a dog.
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other.
I know Tom didn't know I wasn't going to do that.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't have to do that by himself.
Tom has a lot of things he needs to do.
Tom and Mary say they're not sure they're ready.
There is no logical reason for this.
I suspected Tom was infected.
I hope I gave you enough money to buy all that you needed.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary was enjoying that.
They said they were fine.
I wish you didn't see me doing that.
Tom and Mary said they had no money.
I don't think I need to tell Tom to do that.
Tom should have never got that job.
Tom told Mary that she was his only one.
Tom knew he wouldn't be removed.
Tom was convinced that Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said he knew what Mary had to do.
I think you're thrilled.
I wonder if Tom's going to Boston next week.
Tom says he didn't know that Mary would not go to Australia unless he went with her.
I know Tom doesn't want to do that.
You're not a fool.
I think Tom doesn't often win when he plays chess.
Tom said he didn't know Mary wasn't able to speak French very well.
Tom said he knew Mary would win the race.
I know Tom came to Australia last week.
Tom said Mary wasn't mad.
I think we've bought everything we need.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't have to do that by himself.
Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it.
I think Tom is average.
You're not just working for Tom.
Tom said he knew that Mary might have to do that by himself.
I don't think Tom knows how it happened.
It's not a watch.
Tom and Mary said they're unrestrained.
I'm from the United States.
I don't think Tom knows how to have a good time.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
Tom seems to be unrepentant to correct his mistakes.
I loved that book!
Tom said Mary wouldn't like that.
Tom said he felt safe.
Tom is homeick.
Did you know that would happen?
I think Tom believed me.
I don't think we can do that by 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary would probably not do that.
I thought you said we weren't going to do that anymore.
I know that Tom doesn't know anyone who is able to do that.
I'm very sure Tom has a girlfriend.
I thought you might be the only person who would listen to me.
I know Tom didn't know Mary did that.
Tom said he thought Mary would be nervous.
That's the guitar I want to buy.
I think Tom did it.
See you tomorrow morning!
They told me they were ambidecraft.
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary has to do that.
I really thought Tom would change his mind.
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped buying a chocolate bar.
I doubt so serious that Tom's gonna be excited about that.
I didn't know I was supposed to help Tom do that.
Whatever you say, I'm sure I'm right.
Tom said he didn't need any more help.
We cannot change our schedule.
I was surprised when I heard that Tom was arrested.
Tom and Mary probably don't know they're not supposed to park there.
I thought you could use a friend.
You're not really gonna kill Tom, are you?
They said they would be willing to help us.
Tom told me he did that.
Tom's not the same as he was 30 years ago.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this today.
I doubt Tom won't tell Mary she needs to do that today.
America's Civil War lasted four years.
They say they're disappointed.
It is not always easy to distinguish what is good from what is bad.
Tom said he's going to try something he has never done before.
I don't think Tom is strong.
It's not too hard.
Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us.
I doubt Tom and Mary are doubtful.
You're a parude.
Tom said he would have done that if he could.
I don't think anyone really wants to do that.
Tom said he wanted to kiss Mary goodnight.
If you do that, I will.
I think Tom is unplaceable.
They told me they were tempted to do that.
