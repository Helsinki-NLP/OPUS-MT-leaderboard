Johann Edward: The ability of languages is vital for the world’s citizens
In Scotland’s private schools, a track record records of accommodations, and this is being processed in 2018 with another set of testing results that you are being built with personal and social skills in games, arts, music, and other brothers.
These schools, represented by some 30,000 students in Scotland, try to give their students and parents the best service.
Individual schools are the goal of their students to be the next and higher education, choose the career, and prepare them as a citizen of the world.
A educational field that can design and apply the texting of the Bespock school, we are looking at modern languages as a popular and essential feature of schools
Nelson Mandella said: "If you talk to a person in a language he understands, he goes into the brain.
If you talk to her in your language, she goes to her heart.
This is a powerful basis that we cannot trust only English when we want to contact and trust people of other countries.
We can see this year's recent test result, that languages are at the top of the top top of the top of the top level of schools.
Cool 68 percent of the students received a high grade by reading foreign languages.
SCIS’s 74 member of schools symbolizes that 72 percent of the students received a high grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who have received it are reading German, 69 percent of French, and 63 percent are learning Spanish.
It gives evidence that the indigenous schools in Scotland are finding support as special skills in foreign languages that will be necessary in the time when children and young will be brought up.
Now, as a subject, the topics of language, STEM (practice, engineering, and mathematics) are now being detected as well as in other places.
In 2014, a report by the Communist Committee for Rosgar and Forecasts found that 17 percent of the population lack the language production of the laboratory.
So the language skills are being extremely demanding for their future careers.
Languages are needed for the interest of more experienced workers in a business world, and they need skills.
And if any man have a proposal, and have learned another language, they shall be profitable to him in the present lifetime.
A brilliant person who is able to communicate directly with the people of the foreign countries will be put forward in his own case.
According to the YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent of young people were unable to speak the foreign language well, and French is the same language spoken by two numbers.
This is the reason why it is important to buy money to teach the children of today.
Many languages, specifically developing places, in which children will be prepared with an excellent opportunity to get a meaningful business.
In the midst of Scotland, schools will be different from what they teach.
In many schools, most classical modern languages will be centered, while other languages that will be considered for 2020 will teach the most important languages, such as Mandarin or Japan.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will be many languages to choose for yourself in schools, including educational staps, which are vast in this area.
Scottish has been dedicated to educating the environment in self - educational schools that will prepare children and have the need to be successful, whatever will be in the future.
This can't be denied at this time, in a global commercial environment, that language is very important for the country, so it should be part of the teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "Internal communication skill".
Individual school schools will continue to provide choices, development and skills for young people in Scotland.
"The source is not English."

Aim to place the suits in the order which fits the current layout most naturally, but is most likely to match that of the player.
So they will say, ‘ Where is the speed now? ’
Jordan Spieth went down to rest for the day, and said, "I know that they had six turtledoves, and this is the four; for we are going up a little."
Europe has the advantage of reaching more than 12 digits in the field.
As Steth says, Americans feel that they have a lot of interest in their game, and they have a lot of interest in the game, not as much as they have received three digits from each of them and play together every day.
Spith has been affected to the earth, and has gone forward as an example.
As he walked through the streets, they were sharpened by the sleeve of the glass. When he and Thomas came down two times, a great ghost fell down.
Indigenous (Glolphe) Marines who won them in 15 balls, they were tied with the same chicks as he believes that the American team is not out of this.
Spith said, "You've got a real boost and you're going to have your brain."
Each player has left all of these players now.

Francesco Molynri and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players in the last two days who have more numbers than Spieth and Thomas, the biblical story of the Ryder Cup.
Epoch but lovely couples are four and cannot be misused.
"Mollywood" was one of the two who didn't die on Saturday afternoons, but Saturday morning, Saturday afternoon, they kept looking at the boggies and went back to the nineth Friday morning.
This race and the way the power of both of them plays the largest largest crowd that they are the winners of the Sunday, and there is no greater democracy that can prevent the triumph of the Great European as the Sun Le Golf National.
Both are at the same time differently.
Although EURPOPII’S statements are inseparable.
When the Indigenous Alex Narran was married, Baba Watson and the Web Simson did a little work for Sergio Garcia, the prime minister of four genders in the morning.
A bogey and two dolls brought Spanish and The Watchtower into one of the trucks, and they never had to go out.
Even though, on Sunday, there is no one outside your house to cure you.
It's interesting to see four gangs and four passengers close to, because the effect of the couple's opinion, they advised, did not give, and the way a policies can change at that time.
EUROP has played as a team, and the next and last days, but the four known sessions also showed that the team has a geographically invading the U.S. United States.
The last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe took the lead to 100-6.
The last day of Europe's Ryder Cup. In the United States, there will be a good benefit by playing four Saturdays with the Leed of 110-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari's inspired couple took two constitutional Tiger Woods with Le Golf National and Four digits to the moment.
Two years earlier on the European team of Thomas Bjorn, the defeated traffic in Hazeltline, who defeated the target American team in the four hours of the morning.
U.S.A. was more aware of the opposition in four contests, two meters won, but they didn't eat.
Jim Furyk team needs eight digits to keep traffic in the 122nds of Sunday.
In the history of Ryder Cup, Fleetwood is the first European Russian to receive four numbers in a row that he and Molinari, after a synthetic week, said "Mollywood", only the second was to win four digits from the first four.

Woods, who took himself in two fishings on Saturday, had sometimes sweeped the reaction, but now he's been defeated in the 99 machines in 29 and was in one row.
Justin Ross rested for four balls in the morning, returned with Henrik Stenson, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka from 2 and 1 to 1.
And there was a synonymous and good day on the west side of Paris's way, yet it was not with Europe.
On Saturday, three largest winner Jordan Speath and Justin Thoms set the benchmark with two numbers for Americans.
They won a great victory in the German Ramam and Len Polter in Spain, and later defeated two hotels, and returned to Poltor and Rori Molkorri with 64-3.

The North Korea says that 'no way' will kill the weapons unless you believe in it.
The National Institute of North Korea told the United Nations that the banners had made their lawyer in the United States more deeper, and there was no way to leave the country together.
Rio Yang told the people's annual annual meeting that last year North Korea had made "a great use of Lazwab", such as the industrial and media test, to destroy the natural sites, and not to spread the natural weapons and natural technology.
He said, "If we don't see an old answer from the United States."
"Our national security will not be trusted without any trust in the United States, and there will be no other way in such situations that we will be able to dedicate ourselves to our own will."
When Rye held out the opposing of the Washington's anti-human complaints, the North Korea could be honored, which took the necessary measures, it became important, just as Punung has done in the past.
On June 21, Ryan mentioned a share of a conservative statement by Kim Yang Un and Donald Tramp's, at a Singapore convention, the leader of the North Korea in Singapore, when KI planned to stop "work" while the Trap promised the security of the North Korea and the Democratic Republic of America.
North Korea wanted the end of the war, but U.S. has said that Punjag should first leave its natural weapons.
Washington has also resisted the Callaway to calm down the harsh international bans on North Korea.
Rye said, "America" enforces the emphasis on "America-Parm" and allows the pressure to increase its level and to make its purpose strongly come true, and "the end of the war" also insisted on the end of the battle."
"It's understandable that restrictions can defeat us who are not aware of us.
But it is unlikely that the restrictions continue to deepen our vices."
Rye did not quote the second sign convention in Kim and Tropia, which the U.S. President of the United Nations in the beginning of the week.
In the last five months, the Minister of Central America and South Korea spoke of three visits in Man Jai-in and said: "If it was the South Korea party and not the United States, it would not have been so late for Korea devie and the philosopher."
When he told the United Nations, Freri, the story of Ry's talk was quite different from that of the last year. The general meeting was "M. I" on a self-determined missionary called the "Racket Man" with the Racket of North Korea.
In the United Nations this year, Tramp, who threatened the northern Koreans last year to "destroy", was all praised for the armed action, but said that there is still a lot of work to do and that the dictators have to remain in the North Korea.
Tramp said that there was no time limit for this, "if two years, three years or five months, no freaks."
China and Russia argued in Yuan that the meeting was to choose and honor the Punjag.
While the State Secretary of the U.S. Pompu, U.S. Secretary of the U.N., told the security Council on Wednesday: "According to the Constitutional Relational Relationship and Uncomfortable until we do not fully, at last, the Democratic Constitution of the Democratic Republic of America."
In 2006, the Security Constitution unitedly contributed to the wealth of the pyuong’s productive and mathematician programs
Pompu's branch of the United Nations found Ryan-sheet and Rye. General meeting and later said they would go to the next month for another convention.
This year, Pompeu had traveled three times north Korea, but the last journey was not correct.
He left the pyang in July, claiming that the progress has been progressed, his "spiritual demands" was banished only in hours for Korea.
North Korea promised to end a mixile site and an astronomy group if the American is taking "unformed action."
He said that Kim had said he was expecting the "unrupted step" that Turmp in Singapore had announced the end of security, and he went on to have a common relationship with Washington.

In another part, participants remain sleeping for long periods, so they can increase the range of heart movements, steel, chickens, and cancer, as well as more.
Then the partners are moved to think about their daily Rutin with a map, an interactive icon of their campus.
"We know that this student will not change immediately.
Professor Szeller said, but we believe that they have the right to know, as if you have the right to choose a cigarette and to know the effects of health.
Modern technical and students continue to suffer constant stress, they said, the beauty of the universe is still present.
He said - Sleep should be a student's 'interior weapon' to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even suggesting that they want to stop the load, as a sleep that keeps sleep in hunger, he keeps himself hungry.
Remond So, a 19-year-old genetic and physicist scientists in California, who helped to create the corus of Professor Czeisler, was one of his first year class classes in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to be moved to the special coordinator of the campus.

Lewingstone 1 - 0 Ranges: Menga Goal Gerard's male
Rangers had another tough day in the struggle, like Dolly Manga's crashing caused Steven Gerard to lose 1-10 in Liveston.
The Ibrox's team was trying to write to St Johnston on his first victory street, but Gary Holt team composed Gerald's second attack in Bus 88 games because Ladbrookes Premiership left eight numbers as a manager and continued to circulate the hearts and minds of the leaders.
Menga was tracked seven minutes ago, and Rangers had never been equal in the queue of the Rangers.
When Rangers are gone down from the sixth place, Livingston rises on the third place and is behind Hibernean's slope.
And when one object is dropped away, the wounded head of the Lineman Calum Spence may be more stressful in the store for Rangers.
Gerard changed eight changes in the symposium in Betfred Cup, who removed Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livi11, who had brought you a number of hearts and was happy every time his brilliant drum made it hard for his opponents to take his good suit.
Rangers could have had a powerful cover, but Lincoln did more with the ball, with what he had.
They want to score in two minutes when the Scott Pittman was sent by Manga Alan McGregor, the first time he left the Globe of the Scot Pitman, but the middle Filder jumped him on his further occasion.
Kyaghan Jacobs found a grove frequency and scanner Creg Halket but his rescue partner, Alan Lithgow, was able to try the previous post.
Rangers took control, but they had more hopes about their game in the third century.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he and Steven Lawle had to be guilty of a single-hour sign, but Refrie Steven Thomson turned away with the episal of Colombia with the signal.
Rangers set the goal of the two first halfs, but the former Ibrox Golkyper Liam Kelly player Lasana Coulibali came to a simple and clear sermon of the Ibrox Golly player Lasana Coulibali.
Although Livi's 34th-minute game could have been in vain, no one could deny that they were the only rights for their own graphs.
Failed to compile a deep set-period of Rangers Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not reflect because Declan Gallagher pushed the ghost to Scot Robinson, who took Menga for a common hammer.
Gerard was so impressed by the media that he changed the change to Ryan Kent, and the scenario gave almost a quick effect as Vingor stooped into Morelos, but the effective Kelly pushed the bok from his line.
While livingston was playing the same game that they enjoyed with Lithgow and Halket because of the long ball with the guests, they were playing the same game that they enjoyed after the long game of Lithgo and Hocket.
Your lead Holt team could be drawn in the last step, but first to kill McGregor Nejakobs from the corner of Lithgow.
Glenn Midton’s location was a riot of another crime, since he was convicted with Jacob, but then Thomson turned to him.

He is a house of affixed, and has a great deal for these teams this week, and this week.

So the history will tell me, and every one is in his team that has not been finished.
You're going to be a dog tomorrow.
Go there and do good.
This will not end until you get a board or a score of cards.
We have a goal, and this is to try to win this trait, and it's where it takes attention.
I've said everything together, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're well aware of what's on the other side -- the greatest player in the world.

The next day is a dangerous animal.
The coming days are personal appearances that come forward, and this is a different thing to do.

When this speed (mommetm) goes on one side, it presses a lot of pressure on the machines between them.
We were fully prepared in our line, and put the boys in the facility that we loved, and you know that tomorrow we are doing some miracle."

The new German continent was rebuilt once again
The German Navy had ordered the new frame of the German Neighbor to change the season of Shit-Uri. But the next year it could not be due to less cost, and the local media reported in the report.

It is considered to be a powerful top, anti-Aircan, and anti-ship mice, along with some steel techniques, such as radar, infrared, and fast signals.
Other important features are that this will not be done for long periods, which must be applied when new frames are separated for about two years from their own ports.

The cost of software was more important because the Badon-Votomberg ships will be run by 120 ships, which are half of the number of the old Bremensi runners.
It has also been found that the ship’s load is too much that reduces its capacity and prevents the snack of new things in the future.
"Rinalent-Fals" shipwrecks are considered to be a double brother in the 700-two tons of the zodiac ship.
In addition to bad hardware, the cost of the entire project was also being made a spectator
It is said that from the beginning to the 2.2 billion, it reached 3 billion ($3.6 billion).
Recent warnings of the lowliest power of the German army, new war chariots, and noises in the slopes of the German army make the most important survival.
In the beginning of the same year, the chief of the German Parliament Committee, Hans-Pitter Barttles, believed that No Sana is actually the "black of shipwreckable ships"
The authorities said that this issue was more and more important than time, since the ancient ships were evicted, but no other ships were taken in the place.
He felt sad that no budden-votomberg monster could join the warship of the Navy Army.

This kind of question will continue with the press, said Sandras, "but if the press has the chance to ask the President to perform the process, it's better to talk to me than to me.
We're trying to do this and you've seen us do this in the past few weeks and a press conference that you're able to talk directly to the U.S. President.
When leaving the White House or sharing in the open sessions or sharing with the great ones, passersby regularly accepts questions during the conference
The press conference is too low with a single match
