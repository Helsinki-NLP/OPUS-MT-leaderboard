What's the news?
Look for Tom and the sheep.

I'll show you mercy.
What are you doing?
Cornavara doesn't respect the border.
Tom has a transical.
I would have bought you if I were in your wake.
Please confirm.
What's going on?
When will life be small?
That is why I accepted the office.
I'm ready for it.
Of course.
Of course.
I hate you.
I haven't complained about this.
And Quachuan.
That's why I took the office.
In 1957, Cookers sent to the sky a Kukuruka, a Soviet Union.

Excellent!
I don't need any more work.

Two times four.
You must do what I say.
Sweetheart, turn around.
Tom and Milky Way.
She will call back.
Tom and Marie are trying.
Naturally.
It's now written in Rome.
Come on, Quakchon.
Like my molecule.
He's trying.
From left to right.
I would have bought you if I were in your bed.
You've been asked to give it to me.
I love you.
I just had a cup of coffee.
No, I didn't.
You must do that to me.
What Is the Weather?
Put your hand away from my money.
What an unbelievable sight!

The whole swamp is swamping with the mosquitoes.
I love you.
Have you ever seen her?
I just have a cup of coffee.
I'm talking to my friend.
I'm not proud of it.
That's why I took the office.
Are you okay?
Is that true that you say German?
Drag and drop the odds, and put them in a powder.
What are you doing?
You must always read.
Fill the number three.
I'm ready for it.
Judge Tom and the sheep.
I loved you.
No, he didn't.
Have you ever seen him?
What's going on, red?
Of course.
Where is your school?
Are you good?
Read!
She'll call back.
Put your hand back from my money.
He will call back.
I've been here for three years.
My right hand is up to me.
I don't really like it.
What are you doing?
It looks like the Menad was in the tunnel.
Where is your school?
Keep yourself out.
Put your hand away from my money.
Wait until you get warm and sweet, with oil, with Nimch and jaluk.
You ever go to Rome?
No, she didn't.
They're trying to finish the job.
I want you to do more well.

Fuck!
I still feel bad.
When will bad news end?
Where does Tom work?
Can I eat the cigarette?
Current Burge Blanka Earth's highest Attalica.
Put your hands off my money.
The weather will start calming soon.
I love you.
Can you fix it?
Yanya was looking for the skurai to come back.
I've been here for three years.
And Quachuan.
It wasn't time to do anything else.
It's not so complex.
Two times four.
Of course.
I finally got my national insurance!
Tom wasn't so funny.
I'm ready for it.
I haven't complained about this.
They wanted to help you every time.
Have you ever seen her?
You ever go to Rome?
Have you ever found yourself in Rome?
Put your hand back from my money.
Are you okay?
Like my molecule.
Tom isn't returning.
I'm ready for it.
Fill the number three.
It's raining.
He's in the hospital.
When will bad news end?
What are you doing?
That's why I took the office.
He put the door in his arms.
The enemy's friends.
What can you do about this?
Tom wasn't crying.
That's the kind of new.
Put your hands off my money.
Sweetheart, turn around.
I thought to him as my beloved friend, but he betrayed me.
My name is James Gordon.
What are you doing?
Divide the number three.
Humbly.
It's now written in Rome.
Tom never forgives you.
Tom and Marie are trying.
I want to see evidence.
He will call back.
Put your hand away from my money.
Tom has a transical.
I'm going to take it as little as a kid.

Have you ever seen him?
Tom doesn't tell us the truth.
Not tomtocolla.
No, I didn't.
Normally.
Have you ever seen her?

I'm talking to my friend.
I hate you.
It's gone forever.
He finished his job.
It'll be okay.
Never return to Gotha again.
What's going on, red?
No, she didn't.
There's not so much snow here.
She'll call back.
You'd like to see you're still alive.
Who has given you the advice of the same doctor?
Tom was not dependable.
Wait until you get warm and sweet, with oil, with Nimch and jaluk.
Tom wasn't on my bus.
This is possible murder.
I'm caught.
Tunis.
I don't really want to stay in Australia.
They're trying to finish the job.
Every one must die.
It looks like the Menad was in the tunnel.
Tom was not sent to the house.
I came back!
It's with me.
Of course.
I hate you!
That's why I accepted the office.
I'm holding him in my hand.
What's going on?
Where's your school?
Tom wasn't in trouble.
Is it time to eat?
I want you to do more well.
Why don't you stop talking?
Read!
Drag to read a photo of this size.
That's not so bad.
I'm not proud of it.
Where is your school?
Drag and drop the odds, and put them in a powder.
The whole swamp is swamping with the mosquitoes.
Of course.
Put your hand away from my money.
That's what I'm telling you.
Tom's not set up a new computer.
No, he didn't.
Keep yourself out.
You're not bad.
Tom wasn't the first.
Tom doesn't work the same thing.
It's not too bad.
I want you to do more.
I can't see such objects.
You must always read.
I'm really funny.
I think you're bad.
