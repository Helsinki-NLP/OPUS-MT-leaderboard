Welsh Assemble members are anxious about the "smooth-smooth"
Several members of the Assembles work hard to change their former MWP (Mamber of the Weelsh Partition).
This is because of the threat to change the name of the Assemble and offers a vocabulary to change the name of the West Parliament.
Individual members of various political parties fear that the name will be replaced by a riot.
A Levite Assembly member said that his group was concerned that the new subconstitution was "encouraged with Twp and Pwp"
For the readers out of Wales: Twp means fools and Pwp.
One of the members of the street Assemble said that as a group, they suggested "nothing" and the option.
A member of the Waelsh Conservative Party says that the change of the group is "surely thought" but mentions the difference between the MWP and the scales.

The Assemble Commission, which implements the law to start the current renaming process, says: "The final decision of the members of the Assembly members must take to themselves what the details will be about."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Wales Assembles the right to change their names.
In June, the Commission announced the result of a population in which the proposal to change the name of the Acembly is a great support to the Oelsh Partition.
The Commission is supporting the Welsh Partment Member or WMP, but most MWP has been supported in public.

Heli Wiloby refused from the dead of 11 million pounds, Peter Jones
Drugs Den star Peter Jones's lifestyle Brand's star star star tankers to focus his new agreement with the TV advocates Heli Wiloby and ITV.

The business was comparable to Gup Brand of Ginneth Paltro and expected that Wilobe's 11 million pounds would double.
After reporting his departure from Turley to Wilobe, 37, in Instagram, Jones left the jet in the air for his holiday.
One source states: "Truly was on the top of the Holly Prime Ministers.
It was part of his long-mediaid's future plan that was required for the next few decades.

More than three months after the Singapore Assembly of Singapore, the world leaders in the general United States at Ryang Ho Saturday convention in North Korea were not able to see any "complicable reaction" to the previous act of the North Korea.
However, he said that the United States has banned the pressure.
Tramp has a more positive view of the talk in her réli.
"We're in good position with North Korea," he says.
"We were facing war with North Korea.
It could have killed ten patients.
Now we have a good relationship."
He claims that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have resulted in positive results — which has been overcoming rocket tests, has helped to release prisoners and to return to the United States workers.
And he has supported the unbelievable way of talking to Kim about his relationship.
"It's very easy to act Presidentially, but it wasn't just a few 200 stabbing here, rather than trying to get out of 10,000 people outside the public. "Trump showed the fingers for the surveillance to be in front of him."

What is certain, the conflict between the 17th century turned into the next development of our nation, and Cromouel, a well-known character representing a part of this section.
As Lord's Protector, he's celebrated and remembered."

During the Middle elections, the president stressed the situation of the neighborhood of Bret Kavana, who chose his superprimary cort when speaking of the importance of the Republican voting in the Middle election.
"We're all in trouble in November of what we've done.
Five weeks away from our life's most important choice.
It's a big, big-- but I'm really running because I've encircled all the places to fight for the poor candidates."
Tramp continued, "You see the horrible Democrats, the Dickal Group of the Democratics, and you're looking at it right now.
And you see the lowness, sensibleness, which they need to take back the strongest ways they need.
They're hitting, getting power and control, they're not going to give them anything. They just want power and control, and we won't give it to them."
He says the Democratics are in the mission of "Refuge and Prevention".

Labar is no longer a free organization.
There's not tolerance for those who think it's on their faces.
When the parties in my area blamed me, it wasn't a surprise.
Because your heart will not be welcomed here - I was the last Levite to tell you about it.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Rayan, received the same behavior because he stood firm against Judaism.

The importance of a responsible financial policy, of Europe and national security, and similar issues, which did not agree with the former former leaders.
On Friday, Nuntingham East Lebar Mitting says, "We want to include and produce the meetings."
In my eight years as local Leber MP, this was the same way the GC Mitting night on Friday.
However, sadly, today, it's not the sole of the meeting and the promise of the "Dailu, gentleness" politics has been forgotten long, if it has ever started.
It is widely recognized that the Lebar Party is not to be compromised and that each opinion is judged to be acceptable for the group leader.
After Jeremy was leader, I thought with fellow colleagues that I had a similar political view that they hoped to take me to the U-Tern and to take positions that I would never have been ruled – whether national security or Yu-EU-E-CA.
Every time I talk in public, and no matter what I say, I'm invited to be removed by social communication, the center's politics, and I'm told that I should not stay in the Lebar Party.
And it's not just my single experience.
Actually, I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because they're also political.
I'm surprised to see all the colleagues who face a storm of genocide or ethnic violence on the basis of the day.
The most disastrous way of politics in this world is how garbagelessness has become normal.
Jeremy Carrierin demanded that Leber Party develop the culture of the endurance of the Leber Party.
The fact is that we are not more free organizations, and each vote or election rule conflicts the group.
For the past two years, many have advised me so that I'll keep my head down, that I'm not so smart, and I'll be "truly".
But I've come to politics and don't do this.
When I joined in the school 32 years ago, we were huddled by the government that destroyed our classes of our widely distributed schools, and then I tried to give the needed government services — perhaps as local quantities or government ministers.
I never hid my politics with the last election.
No one in Nuntingham East has ever been confused about the differences between my policy and the current leadership.
For those who preached to this protest on Friday, I'll just tell you that when the country is moving towards a brochure that will damage family, business organizations, and our population, I can't understand my time and energy by showing loyalty to the Leber Party leader.
But I don't really have a message for the Ningham Momentum, it's for my elections, whether members of the Leba: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no non-sensitivity threat or political intensity will prevent me from accepting your own good.

Ivo Morales, the Caribbean migrant president of Bolivia - who will face a conflicting fight for the next year - he also depends on the night of Monday.
"We're very close to the Pacific Ocean," he promised the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is not capable of making a decision for Bolivia – and if it is, it will be only a small change.
The Netherlands, based on the United Nations, did not have the power to destroy Chile and told that they would not determine the possible results of the discussion.
Only six months after ICJ's final argument, it indicates that the case wasn't "silent," said specialist of the Chinese International Law page.
And in the past four years, it could be left behind for the reason of Bolivia.
"The current Bolivia administration has been administration, ” says Zeret.
Morals' war talks that promote the interest in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk until a period of time, but it would be hard to discuss.
Two countries haven't transferred to 1962.
The Balivia representatives of The Hag, former president Eduardo Radriges Valentz of the Court, refused to take the decision as an absurd.
Monday Bolivia's "a wonderful opportunity for a new age with Chili" and "a 139-year-old controversy" will bring an opportunity.
Calzadila also denied that Morales is still the most popular president of the Latin Americas - Mary Issu is still using politics.
"Bolivia will never abandon the rights of access to the Pacific," he adds.
"It's a chance to see our past."
North Korea says that the parliament of the U.S. will not be until the U.S. unbelievable.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Reye Yong Ho says that his nation will not first be subjected to nuclear weapons if they cannot believe in Washington.
He keeps this statement on Saturday in the United Nations General session.
He invited the United States to follow a high ceremony in Singapore at the opposition leaders.
His comments come when the U.S. President Mike Pompo, North Korea Kim Jang Un, seems to have been on the way to re-establish theory in Singapore more than three months later.
Rie says it is a "Pip Drum" that keeps the bans and causes the U.S. complaints about the end of the Korean war will sweep the North Korea.
Washington warned that Piangyang could agree with the announcement, not with the process of predetermined disloyalty.
Kim and the U.S. President Donald Tramped the Second Conference.
However, there is a lot of suspicious doubt that the country seems to be the only way to give her security.

John Edward: The language skills needed for the world’s citizens
Scotland's free schools have held a track record of academic excellence, and in 2018, it has continued with another unprecedented testing that is just for the efforts of sports, artists, music, and other communities to be strong in personal and constitution.
With more than 30,000 students in the Scottish Council of Industrial School (SCIS), these schools are trying to serve their students and parents in the best level.
Individual schools have aimed at preparing their positions for more and higher education, their chosen careers and world citizens.
As a educational field that can enforce and apply a special school, we see modern languages continue to be popular and popular in schools.
Nelson Mandella says: "If you speak to someone in the language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to her in her own language, it's in her heart."
This is a powerful concept that we cannot only rely on English if we want to have relationships and faith with people of other countries.
From the recent test of this year, we see the languages that are above the top of the lyg tables in the vocabulary between independent schools.
Mot 68 percent of foreign students have acquired high grades among foreign-language students.
From the school of 74 members of SCIS, 72 percent of students in Mandarine have acquired a high grade when 72 percent of German studies, 69 percent of French study and 63 percent of Spanish study.
This proves that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as an incomparable skill that will surely be needed in the future of children and youth.
Now, as a matter of choice, the individual schools and other STEM topics (scientific, technology, technology, and mathematics) are being organized in the same way.
A survey of the UK Commission for the Employment and Schills 2014 showed that 17 percent of the officials have been responsible for their language skills.
So more than that, the language skills have been lost to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are needed in the world around the world for more opportunities.
Anybody who chooses Caribbean, if they learn another language, they will have a real advantage with their lifestyle skills in the future.
A multilingual person being able to communicate directly with the people of the country before competing.
According to Ugav, more than 4,000 students of the United States, in 2013, 75 percent of the conversations were not able to speak in a foreign language, and the French language was the only language of the decades.
That's why it's important for children today to take care of language education.
Many languages, especially developing industrial languages, give children a better opportunity to find a meaningful work-construction.
In Scotland, each school will be different in their educational languages.
Many schools will focus on more classical languages, and on the other hand, in 2020, others will be considered to be the most important language to the UK, such as the Mandine or the Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest may be, there are always many languages to be selected in the vocabulary schools, including special instructors.
Scottish independent schools are requested to provide a educational environment that will prepare children and make them skills that are necessary for success in the future.
In the world's business environment it is not reluctant to deny the languages that play an important role in the future of the country, it must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "the skill of international communication."
Individual schools will provide this choice for youths in Scotland.
It must be done.

However, the initial goal of these gatherings was to help the Republicans gain some speed in front of the elections of November.
In this way, President Trump’s campaign stated that the following week these five Talis was the purpose of "to encourage volunteers and supporters, since the Republicans are trying to protect and spread their number under the Senate and its representatives."

READER CAP 2018: To save hope in Sunday's solitude.
Three separate sessions lasted for Saturday's bikel forsama.
The Pedum of Montom's Panduam is a full-responsive speculation, but the players believe in the truth, and the highest in the national competition.
So where are they now?
"They had a six-point lid and now it's four, so I think we have a little mottoam," asked Jordan Spit to move to that day.
Europe has advantages, of course, to remain on the four points of more barracks.
As Spith said, the Americans feel that they have some help in their way and can be encouraged from many things, and finally the form of Speth and Justin Tomas who played together all day and took three points from four.
Spith was dead from the beginning to the end and was taking the lead from the front.
He was more enthusiastic with his rounds than when he and Tomas went back to the two point after he and Tomas had scored the whole school.
The metropolis he won in 15 days was the same type of symposium that he believed that he was not outside the American team.
"You have to go deeper and think about your own story," said the speaker.
Each player has it now.
18 holes to mark a mark.
The last two days more than the Spith and Tomas are the only stories of Francisco Malinari and Tommy Flitwood, Raider's Cape.
Unbelievable in Europe but can't make any mistakes from four to four.
"Molewood" was the only one who did not get a boost at Saturday's beaches, but they left the Bobby on Saturday morning, Friday, and Saturday.
It seemed to the people and their powers to see that they were defeated by Sundays, and that they had no interest in the European winners without Flatwood or Malinary.
It's good if both are in different ways at the same time.
Even though the European pride has gone far from long.
During Alex Narren's constitution, Bobba Watson and Web Simpson had a problem with the Fabel Nyk Sergeo Gerizio.
In the first nine, a sister and two double Spanish and Swedy were thrown into a cave where they could never get up.
On Sunday, though, there is no one to get you out of your bed.
Particular frequency between the conspiracy, which they advise not to suggest, and the strategy that could be altered is very interesting from the nears of Forbel and Forsam.
To the end of Europe, it has been a good game to be a team and has taken a very important lead in Final day, but this Forsam session also proves that TMUS has a hunger for the fight, especially the Statside.
Europe took 10-6 lids in the radar cup.
On the final day of the radar cup, the Saturday Forbel and Forsam Mach will take the European health benefits of 10-6 bars against the United States.
Encouraged to Tommy Flitwood and Francisco Mallinari were taken to their tablets in the Gulf Nassel for two time.
Tomas Jern's European team, selling the Harry Traffic Traffic in Hazelton two years ago, moved the U.S. to abate the U.S.-3-1.
The United States offers more resistance to the two Mess Zees, but they have not been able to complete the risk.
In order to restore the Traffic, we need eight points from the 12-elevants of the Jim Furrick party.
Flitwood, who is the first European Rukie and Malianari, is the first four-point engineer in the history of Riyadh.
The Udnes and Patrick Ridds were then severely arrested by the UDs and the American Ruki Bryson Dekumbus in order to defeat them by 5 and 4.
On Saturday, the two Masse had a flashy storm between the Uds that pulled himself, but now he lost 19 Mays and seven of his symposiums between his morb and Forsaum 29th Mass.
Justin Ross, rested for the morning, returned to Henryk Station in Forsam, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Quepecker, two and three numbers from the world.
It was a delight to Southwest Paris, even though it wasn't on Europe on the day of the wind.
Three-third winner Jordan Spith and Justin Tomas set a measure for the Americans.
They have won 2 and 1 strong against Spain mon and Yan Polta, and have returned to Hare Polter and Ryri McCallroy to defeat at 4 and 3.
In the history of the radar cup, only a team returned from the four-point gang, but now there is only a drive to restore the traffic against Furif as well.
After two days of the second best, Joehok, it seems that the rubby attacks were going to sweep them away.
The North Korea says 'never' will not be conscientiously dismissed without faith.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Saturday, said to the United States that the current restriction has increased infidelity and there is no chance to leave their nuclear weapons together in this state.
In the annual annual session of Ry Yong Ho World Constitution, the North Korea took action to stop nuclear and trauma testing last year, breaking the nuclear test, and not to increase nuclear technology and environmental weapons."
"We didn't see any similar reaction in the United States." He said.
"Unless there is no confidence in the United States, we will not have any confidence in our national security, and there is no way to separate ourselves from our national situation."
Even though the Washington’s “strong” method against Washington’s “strong” method was described by the North Korean complaints that it would be rewarded because of stepping slowly in North Korea, his statement was so convincing that he did not leave the entire parliament together, since he had done it in the past.
In RI 12 June Singapore, the first assembly in the United States and North Korea, the Kim Jang Wun and Donald Tramped a share when Kim promised to work on the parliament of the Continents of Korea, and when Tram gave the protection of North Korea.
North Korea is looking for the official end of the war, but the United States says she must first leave her nuclear weapons.
Washington also called for severe international bans on North Korea.
"America has forced the "Englishing" to the beginning and has forced the bans to achieve their purpose, even against the announcement of the end of the war." "Rii says.
"The rules can cause our land to be a dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem has been that restrictions continue to deepen our faith. "
There was no commenting on the second top convention in Rikkim and Tram, which took place in the United States for the first week of the week.
In the past five months, the minister Mohodaye, who spoke of three conferences between Kim and South Korea's leader, stated: “If this event is in the United States, if it wasn't in South Korea, it would not be uncomfortable for the Korean subcontinent."
Even so, Ri's speech was not directly different since last year, when he told the U.N general community to target the U.S. mainland by the North Korean Rocket when the "Miwl President" Tram Kim said suicide.
In this year, Tramp, the last year, threatened the North Korea to be “completely destroyed, ” and she praised the key for her courage to take action, but she said that there will still be much work and restrictions will be forced until the North Korea is degraded.
Wednesday Tramp said that there was no time for it, he said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't work."
China and Russia argued that Pyangyang should be rewarded for taking the U.N. protection constitution.
However, the United States Secretary of State Michael Pomp also reported to the Americans on Thursday, security Council: "We must continue to keep the bans of security until we do not fully realize the complete surveillance"
The security Council, the peasants, and the Bassilian survival campaigns of security, have increased the bans on North Korea in 2006 to stop the financial supply.
The pomp also met Riya in Azmlai and then said he would return to Pyongyang in the next month to prepare the second assembly.
Pompo has already traveled three times north Korea, but his final trip was not good.
He said when he left the Piangyang in July, something went on, just a few hours before he was accused of calling him as "Gunda"!
North Korea promised the meeting with Mun to be a missile site and a newly-complexed company if the U.S. is accepted by the United States.
He said that Kim said that he was looking for "comforts" that he had given protection in Tromp Pore, and that was his security Garantti, who was moving to normal contact with Washington.

A map of the campus with an interactive icon, then encourages the participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it doesn't immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know-- as your cigarette food has the right to know its effects on health, "Pressor Cigiller added."
He said that the culture of the “sleeping in Sara” still exists, he added: “There is a rampant problem with sleeping because of modern technology and educational pressure.
He said that a teacher should be a 'growing weapon' to fight your well-being strategies, hunger, and anxiety, to make sure that your sleep is enough.
A 19-year-old rend So, a 19-year-old in California, has also taken a class of his first year of Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes, and he was moved to a campas-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes that all Nativity students will ask for a stadium program before joining the competition organization.
Professor Cyzilla recommends when the students should go to bed and when the pace should be tied to a arraign and should be aware of the damaging effects of the "Nikal Light" created by the Interior Screens and Eldi Alo, which may cause your surveillance's stomaching problems.

The Waters' statement has rapidly received criticism in online, as is the old press of the White House.
"It's inadequate," writes Flizzar.
"It says he has no intention of being a Congress member.
They don't get angry when there is no complaint against anyone they haven't done.
They mustn't be a protester.
Of course they should not ask questions about the purpose of the complainer.
They must be calm and upright."
With Democratic criticism of the judge, the Waters were comparing the reactions of the Waters, Flizzar, who did not listen on Thursday, the critics thought he was very ugly.
Republican candidate Omar Navaro, who chose to post the Waters in the Middle election, has also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's big," he tweets.
In his statement, the Waters said that his office has warned government officials and law-woman organizations about the so-called claims.
"We will make sure the criminals will be revealed," he continued, "and the members of my workmates and members will be sentenced to destruction and destruction for all their actions."
John English Strikes Ageine Review - weak Roan Atkinson Secretary
It is now traditional to see Brexit in any new image with British Tirq, and it seems to be the revival of Johnny English act-Camedy Spuf Francis, which began in 2003 and came back to Johnny English Rebellion in 2011.
Clearly, how many of us are a rude nation will become the chance of a new revolution?
The one who has the license to create new things like the second time in English, which is unstable, is an extensive commodity designed for other languages without English.
He must have shared a note on the Olympic event of Sharitots of Fair theme in London in 2012, despite the adventuration of the Massachusetts, Mr. Bin and a dolphin of Chap.
He based on the main trainer, and man of the international secrets of Atkinson once thought of the Barclaycard TV advertisements that he forgot.
This last Jee-out has one or two unfortunate moments.
I'd like to see John Englis to a helicopter in a slightly small helmet after the dressing of the Middle Eastern Blades.
The gift of Atkinson is seen for physical jokes, but it has become very low and strange, especially "Syrias" and the Miss Empsibils are now a part of the belief of self-trust.
Association looks like it's called to children more than adults, and I have a joke like the jokes of Atkinson's Nirb Shinma in the face of the genetic disasters.
Fortunately the Topcal base is the Great Britain problem.
A cyber hacker found a very secret web network in Briton's secrets, to identify all the British agents in the field, to destroy the responsible agents - to be sorry for Kevin Elden.
This is the last trust of a Prime Minister who has already experienced the full opposition of politics, he is stupid and bound: Ama Thompson has been accused by his best character in Teresa, but there is nothing more to do in the script.
Her grandparents told her that every activist had agreed, so she had to get somebody out of the house.
And that means saying to John Englis, who is now appointed as school instructor, but the record teaches out how to be sixteen-workers: There are some good jokes here, because the English has a school of Guendagari's Rock-Tademe.
He returned to the English White for Briffing and reunited with his former cydic buoy, Ben Miller.
Bau is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, the role of a Jali-Haki-Sticky who has been abused by Vicky Pepperdine.
So Har Majstis Cycret service has returned to the Batman and Rubin Acceleration of Olga Kurellenco's foreign women, Ofelia.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Karishmetik, who claims that he can solve the problems of Britain's computers: Zac Lasi, a sinner Jason.
In English and Bou started their stunning voice of high-sympathetic elevation: they fire in a Flasher Restroy in the Weater's six-thirteenth day; they started to steal themselves in Balshubul boats; and they tried to make a surgeon in order to identify themselves with the internal home of the English volcano.
All the posts must be tieed for the last period, but it's as sweet as it is, it's a lot of children's thoughts on the whole subject.
It's a lot of middle Stuff.
And I can't think like other English movies: The British film can't have any role in Royan Atkinson, who really judges the issue?
Lebar refuses that it is planning to work four days a week for Briton, but it will be paid for five days.
The Jeremy Kurlin's Leber Party will consider a basic plan to work four days a week — but for five days.
The group claims that the governments will share the funds of collecting the worker's work on a more day by satellite philosophies (AI).
It's going to be a three-day holiday, but it's still going to be in the same market.
The source tells us that this idea will be "fit" with the group's financial activities and that it is planning to move the country to work.
The Treds Union Congress allowed to be transferred to a four-day week as a way to take advantage of the changed economic opportunities of workers.
A senior parliament of the Leber Party told the Times: "I hope a policy will be announced before the end of the year."
'It won't happen by night, but it's a four-day activist who has spent the company with the team to protect the financial support of the workshop'.
The Leber Party, the Green Party, promised the four-day activities during their general election campaign in 2007.
The desire is not currently supported by the Lebar Party, even though it is not.
"It's not a four-day activist party policy and it's not considered a group's official."
John McDonall of Shado Chancel used the work conference last week to reveal his view of a social development in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to return power from the "foreigner" and "Lavibans" in useful organizations.
Shareholders of Shado Chancel's plan may even be able to get the whole part of the water organizations because the work government may give 'em' something because of the wrongs that the worker has done.
He also made plans to put 10 percent of workers on the board to evacuate 10% of residents of the base food.
Linds Graham, tell John Kendy "60 minutes" that can change their mind's investigation of Kavanna's FBI.
EFII's investigation of charges against Bret Kavana has delayed his final vote against his choice in a week, and the searches of barracks have raised questions to question whether any of the republican sensors can support them.
In an interview with Ruby, the reporter Scott Pelly Republican Senators asked whether the FBI could discover something that would lead to change their minds.
Kendi was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kendi said.
"I told you to go to the hearing, and I told you, I spoke to the judge Kavana.
After this incident, I called him, and the complaint came out, saying, 'Did you do it?'
He was strongly determined, unconscious."
Graham vote, of course, seems to be unfortunate.
"My Bret Kavana has become an important complaint," he said.
"D. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret has strongly rejected it," added the Graham.
"The name he said they couldn't verify.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see any new changes."
What is Global Citizen Festival and what did it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an unfortunate line of paraframes of stars and a sympathetic mission; the world's poverty.

To obtain a free ticket for events (if you don't want to pay for the VIP tickets), many of the works of Consertgoars, such as "encouragement", had to work to help a universal president to make an e-mail, call a phone call, or to increase his aim of poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been to remain in his goal for 12 years?
What is the real step to invite people to take action through a concert, or another case in which people think they're signing or sending a tweet to the truth?

The group estimates that the safety of the Thubel has still been affected by some 64 million people around the world.
Among the main promises are a retirement of the Nitrogens, the U.S. based administration and advocates, which are promised “to help children grow their full potential, ” to provide more than 4,700 tweets of the problem in the continent.
"with the US government, the government, the national government, and the Global Citizens, we can make social injustices as a history of a constitutional constitution in the April 2018.
The team also said that after more than 5,000 steps in the United States to improve mothers and children, the government announced the release of a project, which will reach 5 million women and children at a time.
In answer to a question asked on the website, "What do you think we can do to end the poor?"
Global Citizen answered: "It's a long and cold way -- we'll never be able to read and fail.
However, like great citizen rights and anti-cronomy protests in front of us, we will be successful because we are more powerful together.

Michelson, in the off-frame, will sit in the raider's camp.
The American Phil Micelson Sunday will build a record on its 47th radar cop match, but he will have to return to his form.
Michelson, who plays in this double event 12 times in the record, has been sitting in the benches of the Saturday and Forsam instead of Captain Jim Furrick.
Instead of staying in the center of the hospital, what he was in the United States, the winning day of the 5th day of the winner was cut off and was busy playing his game in Range.
This 48-year-old site isn't right for Glf National Cors, where the long raff often smashed long shots.
And if the case is not enough, Micelson, 9 November May, is facing the British Opin Champion Francisco Moliner, who has won their four-hour match with Ruki Tommy Flatwood this week.
If Americans, who are under four points at the start of 12 Singals Mass, can start well, the Mach of Michelson can be important.
Furick showed confidence in him, though he didn't have much to say.
"Today, the whole land has been fully understood, holding my hand in my arms and saying that he's prepared for tomorrow."
"He has a powerful self-trust.
He was one of the Famar and last time, and this week he gave a lot to the team.
I probably didn't think he'd play two masks.
I hoped more, but that's what happened, and we thought about moving like this.
He wants to name in the mud, just like everyone."
The May Maye Michelson Nick Foldor will be the most radiocup record of the game.
It can draw so much into the radar's cup, which doesn't even contain his personal records.
In Micelson, 18 wins, 20 rates, and seven hafts, though Furick says his presence raises the team.
"The funny people, Amade, wise, prudent people, like a team in the room," he said.
"I think the new players have enjoyed playing with him, even this week, that's very good to see.
He only gives more than a game."
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large lid can be invisible.

In 1977, Mache, founded in Valdarama, where the Governing Body of Savi Balestros received five points to the Americans, but in some way the Finnishing line was defeated in 141 /2-131.
"Keep reminding yourself that we had a big lid in good works; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we're hanging, and in good times, where we're winning, where we're only in the place, and where we're winning," says Borgon, in the picture, on Friday, and the last two days in Lee Glphe National 5-3 in 2018.
History will show me and all the teams that it hasn't ended yet.
It's full of enthusiasm.
Get in the ground and do the right thing.

The new wars in Germany were rebuilt.
According to local news media, the newest German Nevi in 2014 was to be launched with the New World War War II, but at least the following year it will not be done by the poor system and the loss of Snobleing.
Quoting the military title, the journal Dee Zeit stated that the first "Rineland-Falge" of the new Budden-Wortemburg-Serene was suspended until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to be in the Nawabian in 2014, but this elevated project has been a problem for the Delivery-Turn problem.
In 2007, the Navabians who overlapped the ship of Baden-Wortemburg-Share will take their place in the old Bremen-clus Freege.
It seems that they will be in the power of art, anti-Earcraft and anti-ship steel, some of the steel techniques, such as Reduced Radar, Infrared and Actic Signer.
Other important features include long monitoring - new frames can be calculated for the maximum two-years from the country's port.
Whatever the case, it was only a long time for the modern wars to help Germani in order to be able to show power in a foreign country - it will be overloaded at the end of the Dee Zeit news.
Unfortunately, last year the feef came to the title when German Navys refused to launch the ship in Hamburg and Vos Shipeyard.
This was the first time a ship was sent back to the Shipballar after the Navy Delhi.
The reason behind the return has been very few, but German media mentions a number of important "software and hardware errors" that will evade the ship in the war.
The necks of software are especially important, since Baden-Wortemburg-sheet ships will be guided by the revolution of about 120 nobie, which is half of the people of the old Bremen class.
Also, it was shown that the ship would be a relatively heavy load that would slow its performance and would create obstacles for the future of the ship.
The 7,000 tons of the "Rineland-Faz" World War II seem to be doubled to the ship used by Germans.
It has also been a problem for the entire project with the training of the Crewer, the undercover of the wrong hardware.
The original level of 2.2 billions has arrived at 3.1 billion pounds (3.6 billion dollars).
The new frequency has become more important in the recent development of the warning of the survival of Germany.
