I'm worried about being a 'mepats' as they look like welsh AM.
Some AM or his titles have been skeptical about the suggestion of MWP (welsh constitutionist) to change their titles.
Ashley’s name has been changed, and Velsh Parliament’s plans have resulted in the controversy.
They are concerned about the change of political parties.
A worker said that their group is concerned about the title "Wp and Pwp".
For readers outside the Wells: Twp in the Wells is a sense of foolishness and pwp meaning calculus.
A PLAD AM said that the entire group was the "Narjam" and the options were suggested.
A Wellss Conservative said that our group is "a great heart" in the name of a Velsh Conservative, but they navigated that MWP to MWP, a little verbal persecution.
In the same same reference, the U U U U U U U U is similar similar to the U U U U U, the U U U U, the U U U. The U U U, is similar similar to the chchry.
Assebli Campsin, who is now the parliament of the law, said: "The last decision will be based on any description of what should be named by members of the Assabulary."
Welsh Assemble has been authorized by Welsh government in 2017 to change his name.
In June of that same year, the community’s public counsel on these projects issued the conclusion of the issue of public counsel, which shows that Assombilla was a Velsh Parliament’s collaboration for the name of a Velsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of AAM, the Commission showed the Velsh Parliament Party or WMP, but the public advice for the MWP was the most support for public advice.
For example, in the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, and the United States, the United States, the United States, and the United States, the United States, the United States.
The regulations of this law include other changes in the essay work system, including the regulations of the U.S. regulations and the Commitment arrangements.

Massedonians believe that the name of the country will be changed
Metropolitans will post the "Republic of Narth Masedonia" to change their country's name and put "Republic of the Republic of the Republic of Masedonia" on Sunday.
These are being taken for granted because of the use of the media, which is the Masedonia province of their own country.
Ethiopia has long been exhorted that his neighbor’s name is a representation of his country, and EU and NATO members of EU and NATO have continued to give him.
He said that they would ignore the idea of a change in name, George Iwanow, the president of Macedonia.
However, with Prime Minister Zoran Zoev, the supporters claim that the name change is the value of EU and NATO.
St. Martín’s hour of silence while fighting in Harlem’s churches
"Thanksily, the older people I spoke to think that every corner on each corner was once and a discussion, "Sir Adams said."
"Today, there's nothing in it.
He explained that Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bar Bars was blind.
"people come together in different ways" today, they say.
"Bars are now not staying in the housekeeping Rumus where people are regularly going.
Regarding the churchs, they worry that the money that comes from the market will not be as sluggish as long as it's expected by the leaders, "but soon or later they will return to the beginning.
They added that those who did not support the buildings of the churches would be condoned by those who did not help those around them.
He said, "The majority of the people who buy the condomiums in these buildings will be poor," "so it will soon come to be the time for the churches to be completely closed because most people who are in these condomiums may not be members of this church."
A decade after St. Martín, 1870 was built by two churches of the Guaranteans before the Mediterranean Community - Harlem Kyrishnam City in 1870.
The original Gora Mathodist group went out in the 1930 ’ s.
A group of brilliant people who were praying nearby took the building’s property.
The Kyrgyzstan team, who was the leader of St. Martin, who led the 125th strategic retilers on the street, was the main venture of Harlem's purchase, and opposed to the conspiracy.
In 1939, a fire engulfed the building, but Ferdinand Johnson’s Parrisoners planned to rebuild it, and Carolon began to build it.
David Johnsen, son of Feder Johnsson, and St. Martin's successor, the Carrilonian name was "green hours of the poor people."
In July, the scholars who argued the Carrilon in this arthrist used him in another way: "a cultural treasure" and "a strange historical song".
Tychigan University of Tiffany Ng, Michigan, also observed that the first of the world’s parliamentary, deonicio A. Lind, who attended the reversal in the Reversid Church 18 years ago, was the first Carilyon, the Greater Careylon.
Mr. Meriwader said that St. Martini did not change his mind.
Last few months later, in St. Martín’s case, Arctics and Controversy have been one of the storys of the church leaders, and the rest of the Episcopal Diosses, who brought them a few possibilities.
The Westri – Paris's director, the general leader, was born – he expressed concern when he wrote to the Dioss in July – that this diossis would try to "access to find" Vestry, but the academics sent by the Diossius and the Continents were not participating in the work.
Some patriotics complained that the di·osʹss was aggressive.

Welcome to West Virginia
During the mid - 1930 ’ s, the president of the U.S. conference on the importance of republics in the Middle Ages, highlighted the situation around the Brit Kevino, selected by the Supreme Court.
In November of that year, what we did will be the case.
He is far away from the most important choices we have ever made.
It's a big, big, I'm not fighting, but I really fight, so I'm going to all places for the great wars.
Tramp added: "You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see, it's happening now.
They are determined to reinstated in any necessary way and to be reinstated by selfishness.
They don't know whom we have hurt, and who we have broken down to power, and to whom we have broken down, that we don't give them the power and the hand, and we don't give them.
They said that Democrats, "opposing and resistance" campaigns are on their way.
They called Democratsna "spiritual and selfish, disloyal, and false" by saying that you've seen it four days and that you've seen it."
The Sinnet Justice Committee pointed out that the Democratic Senator Diane Finstine had a reputation for being honored by the Century Committee.

Jehovah’s patience is not limited to what is said in the heart of a fellow believer
It wasn't surprising, when my company's officials refused to accuse me of the crime.
And then, I'm the most refreshed in the Leber MP line of the Leber Region, which said that I'm not welcome.
My conscientious colleague, Joan Reyan, was treated the same way because she took a stand against Juan’s hate.
I was accused of refusing to agree with Jeremy Corbin.
Happily, these are the facts that Jeremy’s former leadership with the issue of national security, Europe’s responsible economic policy, and Europe.
"We need to be participant and productive at meetings" at Natingham East Laber's meeting.
Most of my eight years as a local Leber MP, the GC meeting of the Friday night was exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not have such a atmosphere, and "More kind, gentle, well-husband," politics's word has always been forgotten, if it really started.
The increase in the number of opposing views on the Laber Party, which are based on the basis of each party’s refusal to accept the leadership.
It was just a while after Jeremy became Lider, because the colleagues who had previously expressed such political opinions I'm going to migrant and I hoped that I would never accept it again — either national security or EU Singal Marquet — whether they were national security or EU Singl.
When I speak publicly and I'm not interested in what I'm talking about, I'm not really interested in what I'm talking about – social media is a shame on me or I'm abducted or advocates of politics, I'm told that I should not be in the Leber Party.
For example, I had to leave home and go to bed for a while.
Indeed, I am better than some of my fellow workers, for my response is of political nature.
I am wondering about the emotions and determination of friends who do not even experience sexual or verbal abuse every day.
Politics, which is one of the most reluctant subjects of this system of things, are the common denomination of words.
Jerome Corbein, who had been in the past week, noted that the workers should be able to do the same for the culture of the patient.
The fact is that we are not so generous that every "unbelievable" proposal or election rules will be compressed.
With the request that I put my head under my head, and that I might not speak more, and that after the last two years, I have received abundant advice, "All things will be well done."
I didn’t come in politics.
As a school student 32 years ago, since I was a school student, as a local city servant or as a government administration, I have asked for more good public service for those who need more public service.
I have never hid my politics with my past choice.
Nobody in Natingham Ist can be confused about my policy and the state of the current leader.
On Friday, for those who support this proposal, I just want to say that the country on which Brexit is moving, which affects family, business, and social services, I can't understand my loyalty to the worker's leader for my loyalty and energy.
But that's not the message that I have, but that's not for Nativity. It's for the people, whether they're members of my economy, or not: I'm proud in your service, and I promise you that no diplomatic threats or political facts can turn me away from my work, which I think is for you all.
The MP is from Krice Leslie Neutingham East.

Melroz's Christian, Robin, said: "The credit for this goes to Irona. They enjoyed better opportunities than we do.
A 14th minute of the Grant Anderson, from Frizzyer Climo, was released, but a Yellow card freed from the virus released by the virus, which was released for the release of the Scotland Cape Roy Hughes, was found in Melroz, and he was transferred to a remote traitor.
And Climo had taken a pink with a pentalty, and then he had 17-5 to a single truck at the time of the break.
However, Melroz began to improve in the second century C.E., and the banks of Patrick Anderson’s Trail deteriorated the five - month periods.
After that, a serious loss of Ruyrid Nott, which was taken from the stacher, and the reincarnation of the Air Stefford Macdomwell, led by Climo’s paranoid behavior.
He was later given a card to the Air’s Hungary Region, Blaire McFersen, and then, Melroz took advantage of the luxury in the middle of the stress left.
Later, the local team returned, but, while Pentalti Lyn-out from Boul without Bullymola, the card was given to Struwan Hutchson, and the Macfersen runs back to the Air.
After he was caught by the black robe of David Armstrong’s box, and after sending the Flickr Gregor Henry to the 5th truck of the League of Renaissance, Climo did just as Climate did when the reconstruction.

Many Bolivians will see the ICZ's judgment on the whole country, hoping that Heg's judge will judge Bolivia's bellivia's belligerence, which has been legally accepted to take Bolivia as a way to the sea.

But some scientists believe that the courts are less likely to be defended against Bolivia - and even if that happens, the situation will not change.
Naderlands-separated UN organizations have no authority to share the country of Chile, and they have decided that they will not determine the consequences of the possible speech.
Only six months after the ICZ elections, the last argument was to be seen that this issue was not "a parliamentary" of China's National Institute, which was said to be Paz Zurate.
It may have been for the past four years to go to Bolivia for the sake of retirement and Bolivia.

John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
In 2018, it has also been observed that the unprecedented test results have been added to more than just sports, arts, music, and other social activities, such as personal and social achievements.
With more than 30,000 students from the entire Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), these schools are represented by the Scots of the Scotland Schools (SCIS), which are the best standard for their students and parents for the ministry.
Individual schools set their students a goal to prepare for their place as a future, a higher education, a career, and a global citizen.
As a schoolteacher who is a prerequisite educational field, modern - day languages are looking at modern - day languages as the theme of choosing a popular and appealing schools.
They said to him, "If you speak to a man who understands him, he will be in his head straight.
"If you speak to a man in the language of a man who knows him, he will come into his heart.

Recently, the results of the regime of Yinda’s test show that in the mid - 1930 ’ s, high - technical regimes in the Mediterranean suburbs are being placed on top tables.

This shows that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages, which will be needed in the future with children and young ones.
The language is now being considered as free school studies, as well as as as STEM (Sines, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
In 2014, UK's Academy for Worker and Practical Education in 2014, observed that 17 percent of the languages were responsible for the lack of ability to fill empty spaces.

In Scotland, each school has a variety of languages.
Many schools focus more on modern languages, while others teach other languages, such as Mandridin or Japan, which are considered to be the most important to Yuke when they look at 2020.
Even though your child is interested in anything, there are many languages in which he can choose his own schools, and there is a teacher class that is a special teacher in the related areas to teach.
They are dedicated to a educational environment, which will prepare the students, and will be able to make them successful, even though they may be in the future.
This time, a global business environment is unable to deny that language is an important part of the country’s future, so it is vital to be taught by the emphasis on education.
Of course, modern languages should be considered "Internal communication skills".
It will continue to make this choice, distinction, and excellence for young people in independent schools Scotland.

North Korea is asking for the beginning of the war of Korea in 1950-53, but U.S. States said that Pyongyang should first release his infectious diseases.
Even the Washington has opposed the demands of refusing to take back the harsh international bans laid on the northern Korea.
Rye said, "U.S." is the first to force "stop the economy" and forcefully empowered by restrictions to achieve their objectives, and "warning the end of the war" has also been issued.
"There will be only one idea of those who are unreliable about us.
But the problem is that the restrictions continue to disrupt our confidence.
The U.S. leader of the U.S. states that the second meeting between Kim and Trump did not mention any of the plans of the U.S. leaders in the United States during the early part of the week.
Instead, the मंत्रors underlined three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Muun Ji-in between the following five months and said: "If the South Korea had a party to stop the economy, and if it had not been U.S, it would have been a constitution to stop the Korean island's pronunciation.

In the United Nations, who had warned the last year of trample in North Korea, they praised for their courage for the steps taken for disfellowshipping Kim, but said that they had to do much work, and the end of the North Korea was to continue until the ban continued.

However, the U.S. Secretary of Maike Pompio U.N. Security Administration chairman said: "Secure bans should be strictly and determined to continue until the expiration is over and over.
The security परिषद्‌ has blocked the North Korea from 2006 to prevent the pronunciation of pyongyang’s pronunciation and explosion programs.
Pompio met Réré outside, and on the public meeting, he said that the next month they would visit Pyongyang to prepare for another meeting.
Pompio, who had already visited North Korea three times before, was not the last visit.
In July, they left the Pioangyang to say that it was progress, just for North Korea, they're “praying like a roost” in order to announce it in just a few hours.
In that month, the North Korea and in the company of the Muna promised that if the United States made a convenience of the United States, they would destroy the site of the controversy and also the atoms.
They said that Kim told them that the "related solutions" that they wanted was to take steps to take place in Singapore, the promise of security in Singapore and Washington.
The students of Harvard’s students are studying the best way to rest.
The Harvard University of Cafene-Sewan, which is now a new practice for all of his newly-prepared students, to have a new sleep program to cope with the genetic culture of the Cafene-Sevine.
According to one study expert, “the basic information about how to care for a number of youngsters in one of the world’s largest countries is often unwittingly unwittingly unwittingly. ”
Slipe Medicine professor of Harvard Medical School and specialist Charles Chizler, experts at the University of Slyp Medicine and Women, have made a study process that is considered to be the first one in U.S.
They were encouraged to start this practice when explaining the results of their education when they were sleeping.
‘ Afterward, one girl came to me and said, ‘ Why was this said to me now, when I am in my last year?
She said that she hadn't told her about the importance of sleep, which I am wondering.
This study program, which is the first time presented in this year, shows that the students and their classmates need to do their work and to improve their normal health.
According to Dr. Paul Beryera, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School, and a psychologist at the University of Medical Health Service, observed that after weekends, the student has been seriously asleep from sleep.
A brother who lives in his mid - 30 ’ s says: “I’ve been studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
In one area, there is a dormant room, where students are coffeeing, and the results of the caffeine and light, and the lack of sleep, and the players have a role in the activities of sports, teachers, and books that highlight the importance of sleeping time.
In the second part, participants are told how long sleeping increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Afterward, the Campus map, along with communicationactive Icons, moves the audience to think about their daily activities.
"We know that this will not change the students' behavior.
But we believe that they have the right to know – as you have the right to know the health consequences of smoking,” said Professor Chizler.
They said that pride's culture is still present, in which modern technology is affluent and constant pressure to increase students's attention, meaning that sleeping is a problem.
To ensure that good quality, sufficient sleep, is to have a secret weapon to cope with stress, tiredness, and anxiety, which they say -- to avoid the weight of weight, for if the brain is tolerated from sleep, it keeps hungry and sustains them forever.
The 19 - year - old Remmond gold professor Chizler, who learned Camical and Physical Biology, helped make this practice program for his first year in Harvard during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the study process opened his eyes and moved him to go through the campus's course.
He hopes that in the following stage, all the responsive students will be told to do so before they enter the contest organization.
Professor Chizler recommends that the students should go to sleep and awake at times, and keep alert to the effects of the ellectronic screens and LED lights that are electronic and electronic lights, which will cause your body to be slumbered, so that the problems of sleeping may arise.
Leavingstone 1 – 0 Rangers: The balls of the galaxy in the Gerald's organization are insignificant.
The regexers took another step when the steak of the Dolly stew was defeated by 1-0 at the Livingston of Steven Gerald's Levin Gerald.
After their first victory in February 4-1 of the Ibrox Union St. Johnston, their way of victory in February 4-1, they were looking for their first victory in their way, but Gerald’s second victory in 18 games as director for Gari Holt’s Constitution, resulting in the second victory of the 18 games, their organization, the Ledbrox Primeiomiership, remained eight.
And the monkeys swarmed seven minutes before the semi-time, and the regression of the regressing team was never seen in the same way.
The regexers now have been removed from the sixth location, and they have reached the third location of the Livingstone, which is only behind the slope of the hybernian slope.
Another problem may arise for Ai and Rengers, since the second end of the second part has been cast. Lincolnsman Kelm, the head of Spain, had to be treated for the wounds that had been put on the head of the leans.
Gerald made eight changes in his organization, which made the elephant of Betfred Cape change.
On the other side of the Holt, the same Livy played with 11 men who had received a score from Hartz in the last week, and he was delighted that every time he put his colleagues in his beautiful manner.
Even though the reengressers had more control over the chendus, Livingston used the steel that had them.
It could only be in two minutes, when Le-Off, the first-day of the Machgrader sent Scot Pitman to the streets of Ann McGreegar, but Midfields did not allow him to go to Scot Pitman.
Kygan Jakebs, on Deep, sent Free-Curric Craig Holocaust to the DFNCV participant, Alan Lithga Back post.
In time, Rengers took control, but the last Thorard played a part of their confidence in the game.
Alfredo Morlos, who became his wife and Steven Lolles, was convinced that he and his wife would have to pay the penal liquid over to Mark, but Rephire Steven Thomson did not pay the collaboration.
Rangers could only kill two Furst-Haf Shots, but Maji Ebrox गोलiper, Lim's lusana Collybel's header, and the stairs of Ovi Izaria are not so hard to hold.
It was the first bullet of Livi's 13th-minute, which was against the flower of the volcano, but it won't be a competitive thing for him.
The regexers dup failed to resemble the jacks set-plus of the jobs again.
When the DCLAN Galger gave Chendu Scott Robinson, the Scott Arfield, who quickly chose to complete the ceremony, did not respond.
And Gerald called Rayon Kent's place in the Brekek, and showed his skill to call the Collebell, and the change was immediately manifested. Morlos, on Wings, gave him a hand but a harborer, came from his line to block the block.
However, Lithga and Holocaust, Livingston’s favorite way of playing with guests, held back on one of their texts.
In the last decade, Holtt’s skin could be infected, but the Macgreggars stood firm in order to prevent the zebbs from coming from Lithga, far away from the Cornner.
The man named Glen Midtleton, who changed the reengress, said that he was delayed to take a second to Pentalti on the floor but did not listen to him again.

John English Stryx Aghan - less effective Rowan Actinson's secret widbon
In any new movie, the story of the British is now traditional to see the effects of Braxit, and it applies to Johnny English-Comeddy Widmunn franchiz - who started in 2003 as Johnny English, and in 2011, Johnny English Rebourn.
Would you like to be happy about how much we're worthless for the new export opportunities of the country?
In any case, the unprecedented verdict of Rakri's face would have been renewed to Johnny English - his name suggests that he has a huge comic comicic crision design for those in English areas.
He is indeed a fool acquainted with a witchcraft agent who is a little missile glammers, but he is a minor colleague like Bin and has a note in the London Olympics of 2012's Open Open of the Fire Thames of Chariots of the Fire Thames.
It is also the source of the architectural architectural movement, based on a traveler and acquaintanced international man, who has now gone to the Memorial of Tychicusard’s death.
The newest JE film in this film is also one-two beautiful moments.
I was impressed by the fact that John Engleish Mediterranean clothes, helicopter, and helicopter’s feet tied his head to the top.
The gift of physical funds given to Atkins is shown, but the vendor is very effective, especially as 007, and as the mission emposible film Browns now include jokes as an object of trust.
Vinod looks like a plan for adults, not for children, but for young children, and I feel that the unprecedented accident of Johnny English was uncomfortable. It wasn't the imagination and focus of the movie of the Aktinson.
Now, the general basis of the subject is the Great Britain’s problem.
He enters the Super-Sycrate Web network of a Siber-Hacker Britan's secret website and opens the identity of all the Agents of Britain's work, which is shocking to work on the Agent - Kevin Elden is very small.
This is the last hope for the president who has already been involved in politics: Amma Thompson, who has set a very beautiful vessel like you, but it is not easy to do anything more.
Her secret counselors point to her that every active secretary’s information has been revealed to her, so she has to bring someone who has been released.
And this means that the foolish Johnny English, is now a school teacher and is a teacher of the High Compassionate Intelligence, and the practice of secret operatives, teaches: There are some interesting occasions: because English schools make the Rock-Taipe Horgeririe accidery.
In a quick way, English is called Opscanlin Briffing in the Whitehorol and again meets his long-time colleague, Bos.
Bo is now married, and she has married a submarine commander, Joli-Hoki-stics-Role, who has a artist's ability, such as Vicky Pepperdine.
By the end of each magazine’s secret service, Batman and Robin, accompanied by a beautiful woman named Olga Kurillenco, who was a victim of a surgeon.
During that time, the Krishmai, who claims that the prime minister can solve the problems of the computer’s computer, is under the dangerous influence of the survival: Jeck Lassein Walta, the dangerous surgeon.
The English and Bo Bo starts their sensational funding: They fire the French restaurant; they skeptical themselves from Voltelt's highway hotel; and the English sets up a virtual real headset to identify themselves as Walt’s home.
It's all the last time for the last time, but it's a lot of fun and aggressive, and it's like a TV show.
In fact, some of the materials that are available in the world are relatively small.
Just like Johnny English films and other Johnny films, I still wondered: Is it possible to make the British movies advertising Rowan Actinson his speculations?
Leber Party suggested that the British were working for four days each week and that they were planning to get five days' wages
According to the British newspaper Jeremy Corbins Leber Party, the youngest man who was planning to earn five days a week’s work and accommodations was thinking of taking care of him.

A former Leber Party Source said to the Sandy Times: 'The change is expected to be announced after this year.
It's not going to happen in the night, but four days' work is a week's agency, which is involved in the view of the economy of the economy and the total industry policy of the party.
The Leber Party, which is the first party, was not the imagination of the Leber Party, but the Green Party of 2017's Global Choices promised four-day work in their preaching work in their 2017.
However, the record is not fully composed by the Leber Party.
Leber Party's provincial president said: 'The weekday work is not the ceremony of the party, but the party has not considered it.'

This means that the plans of the monkeys have also meant that the current constitutionals in the waters are not able to return to the entire part of their continent because the worker could've done with the use of non-violences.
They also rejoined the plans of the workmates to take the company’s directors into the company, as well as to those who are able to receive a yearly profit, to make 10 percent of the workmates in private areas to make a public accommodations available to them.

They were unrestrained, sluggish, and disgusting.
Graham’s idea, however, seemed to be the case.
He said, "I've decided about Brett, and he can change a big accusation."
"Do. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know: Bret has been denied the charge of the whole power," Graham Christine Blossy's references to the next.

But how successful are the ग्लोबल Citysen when it was 12 years old for our purpose?
The idea of making a free musical sites for the people is a sincere way to evaluate the people’s activities or another type of "kliticivism" which is simply anonymously advocates of an online request or a tubbit that really makes a difference.
Global Citizen says that since 2011, their colleagues have been registered as "work" more than 19 specialists for various purposes.

Pover of Newtrison is a member of the U.S. Constructors and coordinators who help children to make progress with their ability" and who have promised to give over 4700 to the world’s citizens after they have arrived from 4700 to destroy the coffin in Rwanda.
In April 2018, a musical program in the UK government, gifts, national governments, and world citizens helped us to make a number of ratings of social injustices in history, ” said Povern of Newtrison, Tracy Ulman, in a musical courtyard of April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 active acts in the U.S.A., the government announced that 50 million women and children would be able to provide food for plants and plants.
"What do you think we can eliminate poverty in a very bad way?" answered the question.
"This is a big and hard way, sometimes we're going to fall and fail.
But, like our former rights and racial differences, we will succeed, for the unity of the congregation has increased our strength.
Janet Jackson, The Wicked, Shan Mendice, Cardy B, Janel Mone, some artists who were present in New York's holidays, these are part of the survival of Debora-Li Fernez and Hugh Jackman.

The German new wars were rebuilt again
According to the report, in 2014, the newest wars in Germany were to be executed in order to replace the wars of the war, but the bad systems and the costs resulting in less than the next year.

But after the first of the ship had received the ship, he returned to the company that was to which the ship was bound.
There was no information about the reasons for returning, but German media called "Software and Hardware Error" and said that it was not suitable for war campaigns.
The software lack was especially important, since the ship in Baden-Wutenburg-Service's ship will be launched by 120 ships - the old Bremen class is half human beings of the war in the Bremen class.
It also showed that the ship was a large stadium that would reduce its activity and that it would not be possible for the ship to improve in the future.
The "Rhiland-Faez" is considered to be a double weight than the ship used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the drought hardware, the entire project has also been a problem with the training of the financed driver.
She has reached the beginning of 72.2 Billion - astronomers with $3.6 billion ($3.6B).

The officer said that the problem is getting worse as soon as the time is coming, because old ships have been disabled, but they have not been replaced by new ships.
They lamented that there was no fighter in Baden-Wuttungberg-separators in Badden-Wutenburg-Speech's surveillance to launch the ship.
