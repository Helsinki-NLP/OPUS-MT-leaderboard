It's a kind of cat.
It's a interesting city, New York.
It's a pity that you can't travel with us.
It's a pity that you can't join us.
It is a privilege to meet you.
Be quick to take your time and make mistakes.
It is clear that he is at home.
It's Friday.
It's getting bigger.
It's getting dark outdoors.
It's getting dark out.

They should have a second home in the United States.
It's time for you to go to bed.

It's a beautiful day!
It's about time you got here!
It's a complete disaster.
It's a deadly poison!
It's a good thing that Tom did.

It's very hard for me to walk so far.
It's since we last met.
It's a while since I told you that I love you.

It's going to be difficult to do.
It's going to be difficult to find someone to replace Tom.
It's going to be easy to find someone to rent this house.
It's gonna be hard to do that now.
It's hard to find someone to replace Tom.

I have done everything you asked me to do.
I've done that many times.
I've done that more than anyone else.
I've enjoyed talking to you.

I have to do something with these radishes.
I heard that shoplifting is fun.
I heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.

I was hoping it was a joke.
I was hoping you and I could get together this afternoon.
I was just about to call you, but you beat me to it.
