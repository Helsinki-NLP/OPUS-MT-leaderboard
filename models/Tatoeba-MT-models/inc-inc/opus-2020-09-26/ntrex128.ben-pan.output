The president of Macedonia, Georg Ivanov, who is the opposition of the democracy against the name of the change, says he will ignore the democracy.
Although, the democracy supporters, including the Prime Minister Joran Zaev, thinks that the name change is an important step for European Union and Nato.

However, sadly, today, it's not the soup of the meeting, and the promise of "Dalu, gentleness" has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It is advisable that the Lebar Party is not to be treated differently and that every opinion is judged whether it is acceptable for the group leadership.
After Jeremy leader of Jeremy, it started to be the beginning of my colleagues that I felt that I was giving a similar political view of myself and asked them to take a position that I would never have been ruled - whether national security or you units.
When I talk in public, and even if what I say isn't possible, I'm invited to get away by social media, center politics, and I'm told that I should not stay in the laber party.
And that's not just my own experience.
Actually, I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because they're also political.
I've been surprised to see all the colleagues I'm dealing with, or the genocide of gender, or the genocide of genocide.
The most disappointing way of politics in this world is how garbagelessness has become.
Last week, Jeremy Kurmin claimed that the Lebar Party should be born into the culture oflerance.
The fact is that we're not the release organization and that each "nationatta" vote or election rule has a change group.
For the past two years, many advised me so that I'm going to put my head down, that's not so swollen, and I'll be "right" or "I'll be right."
Of course, I have been in politics, but I have never done this.
After 32 years ago, when I joined in the Lebater as a schoolteacher 32 years ago, we were released by the government's Afhela, which destroyed our widely distributed school classes, and then I tried to give the necessary government services, even though it was a local constitutional or a government minister.
I never hid my politics with the last election.
No one in NTingham East has ever been confused about my policy and the differences between the current leadership.
For those who preached to this movement on Friday, I'll only say that when the country is moving to a Brexit where family, business organizations, and our population will be damaged, I don't know how to show loyalty to laber Parti’s leader and time and power are unacceptable.
Of course, I don't really have any message for the NTingham Montamam, which is to my elections, to the labar members: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no non-sense threat or political intensity will prevent me from accepting your best interests.
I'm an MPP from Kris Leslie Ntingham East

John Edward: The language skills of the world are needed
The free schools of Scotland have held a track record of academic gravity, and in 2018, it has continued to produce another unique test of test that only supports personal and constitutional efforts in the race, art, music, and other communities.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, Scottish Council of Indignant School (SCIS), these schools are trying to serve their students and parents in the best level.
In order to improve their educational and educational skills, their chosen careers and the world's citizens, they set up their positions for their positions.
As an educational field, which can use a special school to design and apply the text design, we see modern languages continue to be popular and popular in schools.
"If you talk to people in a language he understands, it's in his head.
Well, if you speak to him in his own language, he's going to be in his heart.
It is a powerful reminder that if we want to make relationships and faiths with other countries, we cannot trust only English.
From the recent test of this year, we see that languages are in the top of the lygg tables with the largest pads in the separate schools.
Mot 68% of foreign language students have acquired a high grade of 68 percent of the students.
From the 74 members of the SCIS school of 72 percent of students in Mandrain, when 72 percent of German studies, 69 percent of French studies and 63% of Spanish students have acquired it.
This proves that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as an infinite skill that must be needed in the future for children and youth.
The language is now being organized as a matter of choice, independent schools and other STEM topics, such as science, technological, and mathematics.
According to a report in the 2014 Commission For Empulation and Schills, 17% of the officials responsible for the reason that they have given them to fight in their language skills.
More than that, the language skills have become obsessed to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are needed by people who need language for more possible opportunities.
Anybody who chooses Caribbean, if they learn another language, they will benefit with their lifesaving skills in the future.
A person who is able to communicate directly with people of foreign countries is able to put a multilingual person before competing.
According to Ugv, more than 4,000 students of UGV in 2013, 75 percent of the conversations were not able to speak a foreign language and the French language was the only language of the Democratic Republic of the Democratic Republic.
This is why it is important for the children of today to have a language education.
More than one language, especially developing industrial languages, giving children a better chance to search for a meaningful work-place.
In the middle of Scotland, each school will be different in their educational languages.
Many schools will focus on other classic modern languages, and others will be considered to be the most important language in the United States, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be many languages to choose independent schools, including special students.
The Scottish independent schools are requested to provide a educational environment that will prepare children and create them with the skills needed to succeed in the future.
In the world's business environment, it is not possible to deny the languages that play a key role in the country's future, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "the art of international communication."
The schools will provide this choice for young girls in Scotland.
You need to do this.
John Edward is a school director of the Scottish Council of Independent School

This message needs to be delivered to all players, which will be the best day to give.

The new war in Germany is repudiated.
According to local news reports, Germany Navir’s newest group in 2014 was to be launched to establish the war of the former Thunder-Jouggian war, but at least the following year it will not be done.
Dee Zeit, quoted by the Die-Wortemberg of the Frigage of the New Baden-Wortembburg branch, has been suspended until the first half of 2019.

Also, it was seen that the ship was a relatively heavy load that would deteriorate its performance and would create obstacles in the future of the ship.
The 7,000 tons of the "Rineland-Faz" World War II seems to have been doubled than the same group of Germans used in the same ship.
The cost of the entire project, with the training of Cruz, has also been a problem.
