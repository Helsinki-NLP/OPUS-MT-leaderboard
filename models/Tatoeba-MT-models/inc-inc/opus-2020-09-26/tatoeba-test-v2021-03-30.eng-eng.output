She's not a good cook.
Tom said he's not in any hurry.
I know that Tom doesn't know anyone who does that.
I didn't know you weren't Canadians.
Come to see us play music sometime.
Tom said he understand why Mary doesn't want to do that.
Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do that today.
Tom told me he'd complain about that.
Tom's a member of my housing co-op.
Tom left the street where Mary lives, hoping to see her.
I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
You know and I do that there's no chance that Tom will do that.
Tom wasn't sure whether he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
I know that Tom may have to do that by himself.
Tom doesn't seem to be doing what he's supposed to be doing.
It would have been tiring to do that.
Tom must have told us the truth.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should do that.
We have to do something.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said he really didn't believe Mary was planning to do that this week.
Tom knew he would be punished.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone do that before.
That's not difficult.
I'm afraid we don't have any left.
Tom told me I should learn how to play drums.
We have not yet succeeded.
I've never been to Paris.
Tom said he didn't eat anything, but that wasn't true.
I'm a atheist.
Tom said Mary was at home with a cold bed.

Tom told me that he thought Mary was puzzled.
Tom said he'd be happy to do that for you.
Tom said I saw a little again.
Tom told Mary that she should quit imagining to be confused.
Tom thought Mary was alone.
I know Tom's hiding something from me.
Did you know that Tom didn't start playing guitar until he was thirty years old?

I'm sure Tom will be back.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary went on October 20th.
I know that Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
Why are everyone staring at us?
I know that Tom didn't know who did that to Mary.
I reason that Tom did that because everyone else in his family did.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom told me that he didn't know how to play the oboe.
I'd like to use this opportunity to thank you.
I would have left early if I could.
I know I have to do that before Tom gets here.
I don't think you're enjoying that.
Tom hasn't talked to Mary about that yet.
I don't think Tom is handsome.
Tom was the only one who was sleeping.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't asleep.
I should never let you go home alone last night.
I think I'm going to have the chance to do that tomorrow.
Tom said you were really good at Tenis.

Tom said I don't have to do that this afternoon.
Tom said it was a good time to leave.
I know Tom is scared.
You can't appreciate the poem until you read it many times.
I deliberately did that.
Tom should never leave early.
She's already married.
It's blasphemous!
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't awake.
Tom said he was happy he was able to do that.
You can't buy one of those for less than 30 dollars.
You think Tom would like to go with us to Australia?
Tom said he likes dancing with Mary.

I hope I haven't forgotten anyone.

I thought you loved romance novels.
I doubt Tom and Mary are born.
Tom has already been told about the problem.
I know Tom was disobedient.
I don't know anyone who hates Tom.
Tom said he think I'm able to win.
Three years ago, I was in Boston.
I don't think I could do what Tom is doing.
Why don't anyone listen to me?
Riches don't care about me.

It's not for startupers.

Tom has a lot of friends here.
Tom knows he cheated.
I think Tom used to be a member of our club.
Where is your notebook?
I don't think I'll be as early as I was today.
It's probably not that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
How many kilometers is it from here to the railroad station?
I don't think that story is true.
He often accepts the behavior and speech pattern that characterizes the benefits.
Tom said you were his friend.
I'm thinking about having dinner at six.
Tom told Mary he was doing that tomorrow.
I know Tom's through.
Tom said Mary's dog bit him.
Tom said he was doing that.
Tom said he's appealing his suspension.
He's deeply involved with her.
I thought you'd show me how to do that.
I'm telling you we have to think that Tom is dead.
Mary's got a hairdresser's appointment.
Tom said Mary thought she could be allowed to do that today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It smells like someone's smoking a cigar in here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I think that question isn't right.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a child?
I don't think anyone saw what we were doing.
What are we gonna do?
I could cry.
There's no free lunch.
I thought you said we weren't going to Boston with Tom.
Tom's quitting smoking.
I think I know what Tom is doing here.

Did you give the key to Tom?
Tom wasn't surprised when Mary told him to do that.
My father is a doctor.

Tom said he was gonna help us do that.
Tom's house is very close to my house.
The host cut the turkey for guests.

Tom told me he thought Mary was rude.
It's not wrong.

Tom and Mary said they were planning to go.
You better take your shoes off.

It won't be so hard to do that.
Don't let Tom do that by himself.
I was so excited!
Tom is a party animal.
I thought it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party.
Tom will probably have to do that today.
I hope I don't have to do that.
Tom must have changed a lot.
No one's better than me.
As soon as I saw Tom, I could tell him he was angry.
I know that Tom knows he should not do that here.
He's here.

I wish I were by your side!
Get your paws off of me.
I'm afraid I have to refuse.
I know you have recently retired.
I knew Tom would be happy if you did that.
I wonder whether we really will do that today.
Tom's sleeping.
You're a good boy.
I should just walk in right.
I don't think you were listening to me.
We're brother and sister.
I don't think Tom's done that.
I don't think we did anything illegal.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone trying it before.
Didn't you get a television?
Don't give up!
I don't play the mandolin as well as you.
Tom said he thought that Mary might not be needed to do that anymore.

I'm as happy as possible.
If they knew what would happen, they would change their plans.

I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said that he knew that Mary would not be allowed to do that.
I would have done the same thing tom.
Are you sure no one can see us?
There is no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom's gonna be busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom doesn't have enough money to buy everything he wanted.
Did he touch you?
Tom and Mary said they're gonna do that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today's the twentith of October.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's not Canada.
Africa is not a country.
Tom was not the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have kids.
I know that Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I think that book isn't so interesting.
I was told that's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team's gonna continue to get better.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom certainly knows he shouldn't do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It's a big responsibility.
I think you should turn in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known that I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom worked together.
Nobody will know I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed to get more exercise.
Tom told me he tried to do that.
Tom and Mary know they should not do that.
Tom said Mary thought she might be needed to do what he went next time.
I knew that Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she should not do that.
Tom said he knew I might need to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn't know that Mary is in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom's concerned.
I wish I had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew Tom was going to be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in prison.
Tom said that Mary thought she wouldn't have to do that by herself.
Tom said he probably won't.
It's possible tom may not know that I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom think he knows it all.
Tom said it's not going to end well.
Tom and Mary said they could not do that today.
I thought we had something to give to Tom.
The pupils did the work themselves.
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind doing that.
You will stay here until you are called.
My daughter is training toilet.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could do that.
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling good.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something happened to him.
Nobody suspected anything like this.

I doubt that Tom knows that Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.

I know that Tom knows how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still chatting away.
You're a nerd.
Everyone was late except me.
He could not resist temptation.
Tom might be angry if you do that.
I thought Tom would agree with that.
I'm a libertarian.
Can I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder whether Tom can help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he didn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom would have to do that alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing is not as good as it was used to.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted that he was rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should've let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should talk about that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know that Tom is a little older than Mary.
Tom didn't know someone was hired to kill him.
Tom told me he couldn't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would enjoy doing that.
Tom said he thought I wouldn't have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me that he thought he could do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was so eager to do that.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know that Tom is a bully.
He's a very clever boy.
How's your dad?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous.
I'm very sure that wasn't what Tom meant.
It won't be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary wasn't tired to him.
I doubt Tom would ever be allowed to do that.

I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it looks like.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he never planned to live in Australia for so long.

There is no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who put drugs in my bag.
Tom said he was happy that Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she read the book she'd pay her.
I woke up to seven o'clock.
I could do that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't yet told anyone they're getting married.
They said they planned to go on Monday.
It's not easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't talk so fast, please.
They told me that they had barcons and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone that they had to do that.
I think Tom paid too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all tired.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was busy.
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

You should stay where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose weight.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary cannot.
Tom could have kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary's not awake.
Did anyone else hug Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to hurt me.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone scared?
Tom think he can do anything he set his mind on.
We married seven years ago.
I could have done that better than Tom.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could do that any better.
I know Tom didn't do that right.
She's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary is better than she really is French.
I'm free tonight.
You think Tom would do that?
That's his house.
I'm at home.
You don't have to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should try harder.
I thought Tom was gonna do that today.
They promised they would check it.
I'm sure Tom would agree.
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that.
Tom said that he knew he had to do that himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the last goal, but the process of getting there.
Tom must put a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance to hurt Tom.
Tom said he was happy that you did that.
I always knew that Tom was a problemman.
Well, I never!

Tom is not busy.
I just wanted to know you I support you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We're all in serious danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I just have a hard-boiled egg for myself.
Have you got a pen with you?
I don't think Tom would be in the next summer.
Tom and Mary may not be able to buy everything they need for $300.
They said they like this year.
Tom wants to know that Mary can trust him.
They say they rejected that deal.

I think I'll stay in Australia for a few weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was taken.
I know that Tom is a really close friend of Mary.
I know that Tom didn't know who was to do that.
Tom think we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom won't do that?
I know Tom would probably agree with that.
Tom shut his computer.
I don't think Tom knows when it is.
It's obvious tom can't do that without some help.
Tom and Mary say they don't really believe John's plan to do that.
Tom could ask me first.
You're not actually suggesting that I go out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should.
I don't think Tom is bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't do that.
I would have done that by myself if Tom didn't help me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plan.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary that he thought John was not hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary did that.
Tom and Mary swear they'd never hit me again.
Tom said he should have stayed in Australia longer.

I know I can do this.
I don't think I should leave before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face was white.
I thought I heard something.
I've already told Tom I need to do that.
I'm planning to stay home all day Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could steal Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one conflicted tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom is aused by what's going on?
We haven't yet started to fight.
Who's knocking at the door?
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they're supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everyone.
Tom and Mary told me that they were an ambidetruck.

I hope no one comes.
I thought everyone could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said that she thought Mary was in her bedroom study.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's going to be OK.
Tom told me that it didn't matter.

I'm twelve.
I forgot about that.
Tom told everyone he was through that.
They figured there was no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were happy.
I thought you were happy you didn't do that.
Tom can speak a little French.
I know that Tom is a lot more taller than I.
I thought that was what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that's gonna happen.
I knew Tom wasn't too busy.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom is faster than Mary.
Tom said he thought that Mary might not be required to do that again.
You're not worrying about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everyone has a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said.
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John Alice.
I wonder if Tom can do that.
Tom thought it was hard.
We've walked all around the lake.
I don't think it's going to be difficult to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom is rich as most people think he's.
You won't do that.
You're so hot!
Tom would have been 30 years old today if he hadn't passed away last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know that Tom knows I want to do that.
I wonder whether Tom is safe.
I know that Tom didn't know he should not be doing that here.
Do Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like that.
I don't understand how this might have happened.
You're as high as my sister.
Tom has a lot of books about that.
I think Tom's already done enough.
Do you know anybody in Boston?
Tom said he was the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told the truth to Tom.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admits that he was the one who stole Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told to do that.
We better tell others.
Why is everyone talking about Tom?
Federa kept love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever they ask for.
I know Tom could save himself a lot of time by doing that himself.
Tom said he was hoping he and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that made him angry.
When will he be finished?
You're a very rude boy.
Tom plan to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A pilaf plate with some Keebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning to do that.
Tom said he was wondering whether Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail? These days we have e-mails.
If something is very good to be true, then it may be.
Tom said he hopes you won't do that.
Tom said he wanted he wasn't there.
I thought you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in any hurry.
We may need to be in Australia for a few weeks.
I didn't plan to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who is able to do that.
Tom said he expected Mary to share.
I swim every day.
Who is the lucky guy?
They pretended they didn't know me.
I know that Tom is a little smaller than Mary.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know Tom and I'm not going to do that, don't you?
Tom and Mary told me that they had done that by 2:30.
I'm sure we should turn back there.
Everyone knows Tom talks good Gaulish.
I thought you might not be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he forgot something.
She doesn't like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom's really got a lot on his plate at the moment.
I knew who needed to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know that Tom is a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
That's not possible with the current technologies.
They said they tried to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office speaks French.
I wonder if Tom already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're sick.
Tom said he's not allowed to do that.
I think you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was 30.
You have a sense of humor. I like that.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom would refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you cook a omelet?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk any more.
I wonder whether we can do anything to help.
Tom said he'd be willing to help us do that.
I don't think Tom is capable of that.
Tom didn't know he had to do that by himself.
Tom's dating a girl who's three years younger than he is.
I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that.

Tom said he thought Mary would not want to do that.
I know Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think Tom would like this wine.
I believe we spoke on the phone.
I know that Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There is a certain amount of truth in what he says.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom is a slob.
He's not a virtuoso.
I doubt Tom lied to me.
Tom will finally have to do that.
Tom told me he'd call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't told Mary what to do.
I know that Tom is a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should stay home.
I don't think this is enough food to feed all of us.
He's not the fastest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he was planning to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends are not here.
A wolf cannot be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he hasn't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he was doing.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't get paid.
Are you worried that might happen?
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary did that.
Don't forget to take your umbrella when you leave here.
I'll see that's done.
I'm wearing a suit but no tie.
I'm as tired as you.
Tom thought he might be coming down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have apologized right away.
You're lucky you didn't hurt.
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
Are you sure Tom will do that?
We can't live without air.

I don't think you're paying attention.
We'll need more time.

Tom said Mary's gonna do that tomorrow.
You both are welcome to come with us.
I can't believe Tom's actually doing that.
It's nothing anyone can do.
Tom said he ate too much.
We're all waiting for your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that anytime soon.
Have I ever told you guys about the first time I met Tom?
I began to study the French when I was 13 years old.
Tom said he wouldn't have played chess with Mary.
I know that Tom might allow you to do that.
Is it OK if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said that Mary knew John would not have to do that by himself.
I wonder if Tom is motivated.
Tom said he would have done that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you were to do that.
I think Tom wouldn't like that if Mary did that.
I still want you to do that.
Mary let me know she wasn't planning to stay long.
I didn't know you were gonna be jealous.
Tom didn't know that Mary had children.
They say they can't wait that long.
I'm surprised that you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom may be lonely.
Tom said he thought Mary was not too busy.
I'm absolutely sure that's not going to happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was happy you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary is planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do that.
You're very hurting.
I've already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom would not be a very good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You've finished your homework, aren't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary likes him or not.
I'm lost in the forest.
I know that Tom is a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's ask him to join our band.
Tom told me he'd be in Boston nextMonday.
Keep your mouth shut!

Tom said he regretted what happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary that he had to do that.

Have you got a pen on you?
Tom lets Mary do what she wants to do.
I'll wait until 2:30.
My parents will not let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it will take for him to do that.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why didn't you eat the food I cooked?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried his father's clothes.
I doubt Tom won't tell Mary why he did that.

You really have beautiful teeth! Are they real?
No one knew that Tom was the person who contributed most of the money.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.

Did you know that Tom and Mary had three children?
It's not just a small problem.
I'm not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom's done that already.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should have done that.
There must be a reason that Tom is not here.
It's not right to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me that he thought Mary could run as fast as he could.
Tom said Mary is scared.
You should have been the last one to do that.
I know that Tom is a farmer, but I don't know where his farm is.
Tom says the matter is urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like that.
What could be wrong?
No one could stop that.
Tom said he had to share a hotel room with a stranger.
I know I said I did that, but I can't do it today.

Didn't you know that Tom wasn't planning on that?
I know who's going to do that for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows she's not happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
Tom said he didn't think of the sweeping Mary.
No one ran.
Tom said Mary probably would do that.
I met someone who knows that we were.
Tom said he thought those shoes were very expensive.
Tom said he knew he wouldn't have to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried that Tom's gonna lose.
They told me they were next.
I doubt Tom and Mary are not eager to do that as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the chance to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't Ticklyish.
I know that Tom did it just to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smart than that.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm ugly.
Tom told me he called you.
I know that Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
Tom and Mary told me how much they eaten.
He's old enough to drive a car.

I know Tom's afraid people might laugh at him.
Tom said Mary was still mad.
Tom and Mary say they feel better now.
They hate foreigners; I hate everyone.
Tom said he's not sure Mary can swim.
I don't know if Tom will come tomorrow or not.
They were very busy.
I promise you we'll find a big place.
I think Tom is the only one who has to do that.
I didn't think you'd win.
I don't think Tom has the time to do that with us today.
I know Tom is very concerned.
We can't let these upstarts push us around.
I don't think Tom knows who's Mary's boyfriend.
I knew who could do that and who could not.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the Weather.
Tom's not so sure.
Everyone here knows we don't eat pork.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know that Tom didn't know you should not do that.
I think Tom doesn't know how to do that.
I've already told Tom that I don't plan on doing that.
I thought it would be fun to live in Boston for a year or two.
It's not healthy to leave food.
I'm glad to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I doubt Tom and Mary are those who did that.
I bet I can sit here longer without saying something you can say.
It's not done yet.
I know that Tom is not on the team anymore.
I know that Tom doesn't know he should not do that.
Tom just turned the radio on.
Tom has already decided he's not going to say yes.
I know that Tom is a little snobbish.
What's in the box?
Tom said Mary knew he might not want to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're not alone.
Tom said he would have done that by himself if he could.
Recognizing that there is a problem is the first step to fix the problem.
Mary said she was planning to go.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be away.
Tom said that Mary was lying.
I don't think Tom would be upset if I did that.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't be there.
They said they figured I could win.
Tom means everyone, isn't he?
Tom is not really in Boston now.
I hope to get an e-mail from you today.
I thought Tom was uncompressed.
Tom is no longer a suspect.
There's nothing here.
I thought Tom didn't do that well.
I knew Tom would do that right away.
Why didn't you go to Boston?
Tom said he didn't plan to do that again.
Tom said that made him very happy.
I realize that Tom can get Mary to show us how to do that.
Tom don't think Mary's gonna say yes.
I was afraid I might be late for the bus.

We're sorry we went to conclusions.

I don't think this is the time or place to discuss this.
Tom thought Mary didn't drive a car.
I'm not a fan of libertarianism.
I know that Tom is not going to help Mary do that.
I wonder whether Tom wants me to do that today.

My brother is now in Australia.
I can't stand this noise anymore.

I don't think that's what Tom said.

I want you to find out if Tom is planning to come here by himself.
I hope I'll be able to help you at another time.
They said they figured I could do that.
We both know that's not true.

If you left home a little earlier you would have been on time.
You can't be too careful when driving.
Tom said Mary thought she wanted to do that this evening.
Tell Tom I'm coming.
I would have bought more clothes if I had the money.
I thought I told you not to talk to my daughter.
Tom and Mary told me they've just done that.
What's the chances to tom won?
I'm afraid you can't.
I think Tom won't go through the time we get there.
Tom said he planned to stay in Boston.

Tom said he needed to do that before Mary came here.
That's not what I'm going to talk about.
Both Tom and John say they kissed Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary was ready.

I can't believe you did this.
Tom said he wanted to help.
Why do everyone think Tom and I are stupid?
What are the positive sides?

I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom told Mary and me that we should try to do that by ourselves.
You know it's not like that.
I would have been unable to do that without your help.
I knew Tom didn't really want to do that by himself.
Tom said he's waiting for his retirement.
Whether we do that now or later, it doesn't matter.
Let's hope things stay this way.
I should wait that Tom won't get with Mary.
I think it's very unlikely that Tom didn't know he would not be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.

I think I'll be able to fix it myself.
I didn't think anyone did that.
Tom said we'd lost.
Tom said he should do that.
Are you sure Mary said she was planning on that tomorrow?
There were times I would have lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was crazy.
Tom already knows that Mary did that.
You're not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
It's not going to end well.
I think I need someone to help me.
Tom wrote in all the cakes.
Tom would be very happy he didn't do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that alone.
If I were you, I would go home at once.

So what are you suggesting?

My handwriting is better than Tom's.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they won't be here tomorrow.

I think this is due to the fact that Tom is a small one.
I always suspected that Tom was a little paranoid.
I know that Tom knew I was planning to do that.
You should have been able to do that much better.
We work each day butMonday.
I know you weren't those who did that.
Tom said he has no power to stop it.
I know Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me he was probably crying.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I was the only one who knew Tom didn't want to do that.
I doubt that Tom did that for the purpose.
I figured you might be busy now.
Tom said we should do that ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me too much.
I thought it wasn't necessary for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something about that next night.
Tom admits he wasn't brave.
I know I should have done that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
I doubt Tom's waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead can't bite.
I don't think Tom is crazy as some people think.
I don't think I'll be able to do that by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
She avoided his eyes.
Tom is not as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do that by myself.
Tom says Mary is still planning to do that.
I thought Tom must be mistaken.
Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason why Mary moved to Boston.
I should have introduced myself.
Tom said Mary's waiting to be retired.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I've never fallen in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom ever complained about that.
Tom is liked by everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you're crazy.
He hasn't got a mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought that John would not be allowed to do that himself.
There's no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I doubt Tom's involved.
How many kiloss have you lost?
Both Tom and Mary are OK.
I'm a despicable human.
I'll never forget the time you and I went together to Australia.
Tom is not the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary both decided not to leave.
Tom told me he's sleeping.
Mary tried her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted that he stole Mary's bicycle.
I accepted the lid.
Tom said Mary was probably in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that here.
I'm three years old than you.
When is your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would help you.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun doing that.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been on a meal for more than a year.
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary already had a driver's license.
I know that Tom is a good drummer.
Tom realized he wouldn't be able to change anything.
Tom said Mary should have done that alone.
I didn't know you were still with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy a weathervene.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys, it's not funny anymore.
I doubt Tom is at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they'd do that again.
Tom threw it.
Tom doesn't like this colour.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy to marry Tom.
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here.
Tom and Mary say they don't care.
Tom didn't stay in Boston for as long as he wanted.
Tom said he's a Canadian.
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
I presum that Tom is still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone knows that's funny.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know that Tom can do that sometime today.
Do you let your children play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts that Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the desk.
I think Tom is unkind.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is it going to Bosson to the real Tom?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you were tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom could make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess these days.
I don't think I liked living in Australia.
Tom said Mary should have done that by herself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was deceived.
What you're saying is absolutely wrong.
He is depressed.
I know I need to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary is thirsty.
They said they didn't enjoy doing that.
I'm teeling apples.
They said they would never study French.
They said they thought I was creation.
Tom told me he's uncertain about what he should do.
Tom told me I should say yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
There was nothing left in the frij.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not have to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know that Mary could not speak French very well.
I don't think there's any chance that I'll get there at time.
I think both Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he's not planning to go with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom is sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me he won't buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everyone loves free things.
I don't think it's funny.
If Tom does that, I'll do it too.
I know that Tom still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they're ready to help me.
It's not the one who told me that Mary should do that.
I thought you said you still liked to do that.
Tom said he was wondering whether Mary wanted to do that.
They say they're not planning on.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom and Mary said they really didn't expect anyone to do that.
Tom said that it was Mary who told him that he should do that.
Tom don't think Mary's hurt.
I don't think I can hold on for a long time.
Tom is not as high as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think about the heat scared Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom that I disagreed.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I've already promised Tom I'd help him.
I believe everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me he won't be at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know I have to do that today.
I don't think you really want to call attention to that.
Tom said he knew that Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were gonna kill John.
Leave the lights on, please.
Tom said Australia is a nice place to visit.
I thought Tom was in a big trouble.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech lasted for three hours.
I wonder whether Tom is alive.
I might try to borrow a hatchet from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think anyone would want to see that film more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares.
I think Tom won't be in Australia a long time.
Tom told Mary he'd never come back here.
I didn't know you could not do that by yourself.
I doubt Tom will never agree with that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom is unacceptable.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know that Tom is more likely to do that than he was yesterday.
I think Tom's doing something illegal.
Our streets are flooding when we have rain.
I'll be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have a lot of choice.
Tom said he thought he could do that on October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I knew Tom might be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know that Tom is a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everyone here except Tom has done that.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everyone has a idea what Tom is capable of.
Tom knew he could do that better.
Tom said he wanted Mary no more to do that by himself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was angry.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a university student.
I think Tom didn't do that, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I made enough spaghetti for everyone.
I know that Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she needs to do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that by myself.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know that Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that's not going to happen.
Tom plan to sit back.
Tom said he gave a book to Mary.
It would have been unforgivable.
I know that Tom probably knows how to do that.
I know that Tom was a scrawny kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're partly blamed.
I'm not surprised that Tom's planning on that.
Hardly anyone expected Tom to win.
Don't break my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job was to be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put your jacket on if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary she wasn't planning on staying in Australia for a long time.
I hear you quit smoking.
Tom obviously doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes that much.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me he was next.
Tom said that Mary knew John might have to do that by himself.
Tom said he was good to speak French.
It's not salt.
Did anyone see Tom here?
Tom told me that he thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room I do.
He did not keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he's planning on that.
I doubt Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know Tom can speak French better than I can.
I doubt Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defense.
Tom told me he thought Mary was careful.
Tom was asleep on the live room sofa.
I found both Tom and Mary like romance novels.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I doubt Tom and Mary were busy every day.
Tom told everyone that he was ready to do that.
We'll go to a picnic if it's okay tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone.
It's not Tom who needs protection. It's Mary.
They said they're angry.
I think Tom might be able to do that.
Tom did that whenever he could.
They said their houses weren't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I wouldn't be able to do that.
I think we have more important things we should do now.
I think Tom and Mary were at least once to Boston.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be sleeping.
Can someone help me please?
I know that Tom is about the same age as your daughter.
I know that Tom is a very lucky man.
Tom thought I might not be allowed to do that by myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom is easygoing.
I think Tom would be alone.
It looks like Tom looks like everyone.
I'm surprised tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary has to settle in her new flat.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you plan to do that.
They swore they would never do that.
Everyone stood there, shocked.
I'm waiting to hear why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I'm sorry that I was not as careful as I should have been.
Tom doesn't look very good.
Tom said he thought I should do that by myself.
I don't think that Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen.
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary is sleeping or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised that I did, didn't you?
They wanted to fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I've seen Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know that the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like to do that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary now.
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
You shouldn't just think Tom is guilty.
Watch yourself.
Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that.
Someone has to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know that Tom did that when he was the third.
Tom said he doesn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said I was the only one who thanked him.
Enough enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know that Tom did that?
I think it's like that everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It is not until you lose your health that you realize its value.
That could hit me.
They told me they're losing weight.
My house is not big.
I'm very sure Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know I was still planning to join the team, did you?
The bathroom was not so clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said he never thought he would be able to convince Mary to go out with him.
Tom thought Mary would be the first to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was uncomfortable.
This is something I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music.
Tom said he thought he could do if he had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She's sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wanted to speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom has no prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know that Tom knew I was the one who had to do that.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I left my umbrella in the phone booth.
I did a bad thing.
I doubt Tom would be interested in doing that.
I promised Tom that I'd do that.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's very good to be true.
Tom said that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to obey.
Courgets are green.
I should never break up with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew I'd be early.
Tom tossed his dog some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that.
That's not just possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm very sure I can do that.
Tom says he and Mary will spend Christmas together.
Why did you fail to examine the entry?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom says he can't prove Mary did that.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were pregnant.
Tom said he's glad you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was really meaning.
I know there's a lot of good food on the picnic.
Does anyone have any questions so far?
I doubt Tom is reluctant to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they'd rather come next week.
What are you referring to?
Tom said that he thought Mary was being impaled by what was going on.
Everyone in the room did the same thing.
They're inseparable.
Tom didn't know you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised they would not do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must have done that last year.
Can you take a picture of me?
We should expect that to happen.
It would be wise to do that.
Tom told me he doesn't have a problem with that.
Tom said Mary should not go home by himself.
Tom has to be angry.
For how long have your head been hurting?
Thank you, buddy!
Tom said nobody was fired.
You think we should go where Tom wanted us to go instead of here?
He has ears.
I don't think Tom wants to do that by himself.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.
Tom said that was Mary who told him he needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life in prison without Parole.
I'm guessing that the gunshot I heard was the one who killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.

No pain, no gain.

I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom is a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that.
Tom said he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I know we can't count on Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I think Tom won't be the last one to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom is downstairs.
I need to know that we can depend on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought she might not be allowed to do that.
I realize that's not very likely to happen.
They say drugs are not safe.
I know that it's very unlikely anyone can help me.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person.
Tom said he thought it would be a big mistake to tell Mary what had happened.
Tom thought Mary would probably not cry.
This work is enough to break my back.
That would never happen if you did what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water heater.
Does anyone have a kleenex?
Tom told us that he thought he could be a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom is a hisophiliac.
I wouldn't say anything.
Tom said he was happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said he knew you could do that.
Tom and I are both wrong.
I think you still enjoy drinking beer.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were able to do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom is the person you should talk to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said I had to study the French.
You're not allowed to do that, are you?
You got a big head.
He's very smart.
I never hired Tom.
Do Tom know that you've already done that?
Tom ate more than I eat.

My time is taken with teaching and studying.
I think Tom is proud.
I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary will not be able to do that.
They say they'll quit doing that.
Tom is incometent.

What else are you planning to do?
I think Tom understands everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom is talkative.
It's not my business.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I think you'd like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary came back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary goodnight last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew Tom was not a bad student.
It's impossible Tom will do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
You think we'll find our way back to the campsite?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should have quit while I was ahead.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandma texts faster than you.
Both Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you did that for Tom.
I didn't think anyone saw what you did.
I wonder if I can help Tom.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know it's not hard.
I doubt Tom and Mary are not ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I thought Tom told you I would be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all week?
Tom said he didn't know that Mary was going to leave him.
You're not scared yet, are you?
I thought you'd cry.
The value of health cannot be overestimated.
You'll suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom knows exactly how much it will cost.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know that Tom is good.
Tom already knows Mary's planning on that.
Don't take your gloves.
Keep it up!

Put your pants on.

Is there a lot of Africans in Germany?
Where did you set the television guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It is true that the earth is around it.
Tom could not help smiling.

I've decided never to do that again.
I didn't know you were dating tom.
I think Tom hasn't made a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary that they're not required to do that.
Good job, guys!
I know that Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to be doing that today.
Tom and Mary say they didn't want to do that.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year.
Don't you know that everyone's talking about us?
Tom said that Mary knew she didn't want to do that until the next Monday.
I know Tom's house is for sale.
I don't think Tom's sad.
I don't think Tom will really win.
I wanted to do that with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone he was determined to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was hard.
Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that by himself.
We wish we could do more to help.
Tom said he thought it would be snow tonight.
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
Tom said he would look at it.
Tom said that was harder than he thought it would be.
You would love the movie.
They told me they don't really care what happened.
Tom's speech was not as long as Mary was.
I didn't know how to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry I upset you.
Everyone looks scared but you.
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and he would end up telling them everything.
Did you read the book yesterday in French?
I'm a damaged doer.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could have gone.
Tom said he didn't think of the smell that hurt Mary.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
I thought you were a better chess player than this.
I'm glad to see that Tom's happy again.
I thought Tom was left already.
I knew Tom couldn't keep Mary from doing that.
I don't think we have a lot of time.
Tom said he's trying to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would do that for me.
Tom is the funnyest person I've ever met.
I doubt Tom really plan to do that.
Tom said he thought that Mary might not have to do that this week.
I know that Tom knows he didn't need to do that.
To tell the truth, I'm not your father.
I don't think Tom will do that with Mary.
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, isn't it?
I thought you could walk in Mary's house.
Tom said he hopes that Mary's trying to do that.
You like chocolate, right?
I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.
Tom says he knows Mary can't speak French very well.

I think Tom was the one who wanted to do that.
I doubt that's not going to happen.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are really telling the truth.
Do all of you think this is a good idea?
It must have been broken during the shipping.
They said they could not win.
Tom said he thought Mary was a good cook.
They haven't admitted that they did that yet.
Everyone except Tom knew he didn't have to go to Boston.
I knew that Tom knew why Mary had to do that yesterday.

If I could speak French better, I might have got that job.
Do you feel OK today?

I don't think anyone can do this.
Did you know Tom and Mary were still planning to do that?
Tom told me he thought Mary was too young to drive.
I'll come back.
I don't think Tom is nosy.
I would never have done that.
I believe we don't really need to do this.
Tom could have been faster than Mary if he tried harder.
I knew that Tom told Mary that he was not going to do that.
In my opinion, you're wrong.
Tom told me he thought Mary was deaf.
I don't think I'll go out today because it's very cold.

I knew Tom would ask Mary to do that.
I think Tom should not agree to do that.
I don't think Tom sold anything all day.
I think I'm too old for her.
I don't think I should leave early.
I didn't say I was going to Australia.
Tom should have stayed in Boston for a while.
I should have told Tom soon.
Tom and Mary said they didn't like to do that.
Tom'll remember.
It's not something I think I can do.
Tom told me where he was planning to stay.
I know you're not planning to stay in Australia.
I know Tom was inappropriate.
Do you have a pencil I can borrow?
Tom also wanted to do that.
I could have done that for you.
I think Tom is home.
It's aggressive for America to lose our young men and women.
Tom should do everything they tell him.
Everyone but Tom knew he didn't have to go to Australia.
What's the most beautiful place in the world?
The storm caused much damage to the crop.
I don't think everyone's given up.
Let's get our photo.
I knew it would not be easy.
Suddenly all lights went out.
Tom and Mary said they would probably win.
I think Tom would be hurt if you did that.
Tom and Mary thought they'd find other jobs.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know I should stay and help.
Don't look at me.
I doubt Tom and Mary were planning on doing that tomorrow.
I didn't know how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I know that Tom does that well.
Tom said nothing changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night.
I know that Tom knows I needed to do that.
Stay out of this.
I know that Tom is afraid he'll get fired.
If I were you, I would call the doctor.
I wasn't very hungry.
I have done everything you asked me to do.
Do you have a tie I can borrow?
I didn't think we could find anyone who could do that for us.
Tom is not an angel.
I think Tom is mad.
That's awesome.
Tom is driving over to Mary's apartment to give her something.
Tom said he thought Mary would wait.
Tom said he didn't think that the smell caused Mary.
Tom said he's willing to do that for us.
Can you believe Tom still is just the third?
Tom sent Mary his picture.
Tom already knows that Mary doesn't plan to be here today.
They say they have never eaten the Thai food.
I think Tom and Mary have never been to Boston.
They're playing chess.
I thought I heard someone singing.
I heard Tom plan to move to Australia.
It's not like hot here as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I belong here.
Nobody saw Tom leave.
I knew Tom used to live in Boston.
Tom ran home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he might win.
Tom had no problems with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know you're not misusing me for someone else?
You should've refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
I'm starting to believe we'll never convince Tom that he's wrong.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Tom should never have been left out in prison.
His train comes at the main station at 5.50 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said that Mary thought that John might have to do that by himself.
I know what I would do.
He didn't need the umbrella.
Both Tom and Mary were not at home when we went to visit them.
Tom think I need to do that today.
Tom admits he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had the chance.
Tom told me you were with him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom and I didn't know we were those who were supposed to do that.
I'm so tired that I can walk hardly.
They felt that they needed to do something.
I read many foreign languages, but I don't speak.
You set a trap.
I should add more salt.
I know that's not what you want.
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to marry.
I think Tom is smashed.
Tom and Mary say they'll never do that.
I think Tom's sorry.
You were skinny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could get home by himself.
Both Tom and Mary know who you are.
Mary said she didn't plan on it by herself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were uncompressed.
Tom hasn't told us what he needs to do.
I know you probably didn't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remember where we first met.
If you had helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said he expected Mary to get back to Boston on October 20th.
Tom said he thought he might be needed to do that again.
Tom think you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim.
I knew that Tom told Mary that he could not do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize they're being ignored.
If Tom left at 2:30, he would have got here now.
Tom and Mary said they would do it.
There's no doubt Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom has decided to stay in Australia for another three days.
Tom said he thought I was unconscious.
I should have stayed and helped Tom.
Tom said he thought I'd be able to do that.
I figured Tom would be scared.
Tom think he's the best swimmer here.
I wonder whether it will snow tomorrow.
I wonder whether Tom is pleased.
I'm frying fish.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Slow down.
Tom would have done that by now if he was really planning to do it.
I know Tom could do if he really needed it.
We'll never know.
Tom admits that he killed Mary.
Didn't you know that your taillights weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom's never gonna hurt anyone again.
I'm learning Esperanto very fast.
You're not gonna get in trouble for help, are you?
I heard that women spent more than men on shoes.
I think Tom's gonna be excited.
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
Tom said he would take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do whatever he wants to do.
I thought you were going to fix that.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told he's not allowed to do that.
They say they're unsure.
I know that Tom didn't know he would not be able to do that.
Tom should have told me before.
I have to go to the toilet.
Both men apologized to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John would actually do that.
They say that they also need to do that.
I know that Tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me they would help me.
I don't think I'll ever be able to buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they're snore.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tom said he found something.
A business is not a charity.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had ever been in Australia.
I don't think Tom's like good-looking as John is.
Tom said he thought that prices on that store were too high.
I don't think anyone argues that.
Tom and Mary said they could not remember.
Tom said he expected he would be able to do that today.
You knew everyone at the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unfraid.
I'm sorry it happened like this.
I know Tom is not afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Both Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without some help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
Nobody asked me whether I liked it or not.
Many old people can't keep up with times these days.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know that Tom appreciates that.
Tom told me he decided to do that.
It's a kind of cat.
Tom thought Mary would probably refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
Tom denied that he accepted the money.
Tom said he thought that would not be a good idea.
I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was broken.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard.
Can't this wait until morning?
We're going to land in 15 minutes.
We know that's not going to happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his throat high.
I think Tom is unpredictable.
I'm afraid I lost it.
Tom said Mary was probably grumpy.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they were.
I know that Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do that today.
Don't talk about business while we're eating.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard.
I hope Tom gets taken by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She's got to be taken to hospital.
I would have helped you if you asked.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
It's not a drill.
Tom should have done that long ago.
I think Tom sleeps all night.
I wonder whether Tom is upset.
Tom said that he knew that he would not let him do that at school.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes doing that.
Tom would have done that for Mary if she had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something's not right yet.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked riders.
I know Tom is not planning to go to Boston with you.
Tom said he's not sure Mary has to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be able to talk to Mary in that way.
Is it true that Tom and Mary plan to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know that you didn't want to do that by yourself.
Tom said he thought that would be fun.
I think you'll find that it was Tom's fault.
I thought it was rather ingenious.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are going to do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary were those who did that?
Are you still planning to do that with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
His younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know when you said you would be there, but I wasn't able to be there at that time.
I don't think they're complaining.
You and I both know that's not true.
Let's think that's gonna happen.
Tom told everyone that he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone he could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was true.
It's probably that Tom will come.
I doubt Tom's coming to Boston this year.
I didn't think anyone tried that before.
You should have made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning on.
Tom said it looks like Mary had a really hard time doing that.
I'm learning old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could have done that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard to get along.
They said they were very drunk.
You could have told me before.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was proud.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are suspicious.
I know that Tom never does that anymore.
Tom says he only swears when it's absolutely necessary.
I don't think Tom is high.
Tom was drunk and said things he should not say.
Tom said he thought Mary was interested in the basketball.
Tom told me that he thought this book was interesting.
Tom thought everyone knew he could not do that.
Tom said he planned going on October 20th.
They said they're just doing good.
Hostilities resumed between the two powers.
The only reason for Tom came to Australia was because everyone else in his family did.
I've done that if I could.
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning on that.
Tom thought everyone at school knew he was arrested.
Tom wanted to know how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he saw Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to do that.
I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary to do that.
Everyone knows Tom can't speak French very well.
My discoveries suggest that it's not the case.
Tom found the watch he lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Someone must have left the window open.
I know that Tom is a messy person.
I'm sorry, sir.
I know that Tom knew Mary was planning to do that.
Tom was just stating the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know that Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he would be able to do that in a few hours.
No one doubt you'll be able to pass the test.
Where is everyone?
How did you feel?
Fortunate favors the courage.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still looking at me.
I thought Tom heard us.
It's not compulsory.
I hope no one comes.
What color was Tom wearing?
Tom and Mary would not ask you to do that if they could find anyone else to do it for them.
Tom said he was going to Mary's home.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
We should have hired someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was uncompressed.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me that he was too tired to study.
Where is your luggage?
Both my parents are musicians.
I live in Groningen.
How do we know that's not true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said he thought Mary would be able to help him tomorrow.
I know Tom is chubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom's going to be ready to talk to me.
Tom said he was happy Mary was able to win.
I didn't think you could get Tom to do that.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, very little German.
Tom thought something was going to happen.
I thought that was what you wanted.
I know that it's very unlikely anyone knows me.
Where is Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I doubt Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I enjoy playing volleyball.
It may not be that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
Tom said he was unable to win.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that anytime soon.
There's a chance Tom won't want to go to Boston with us.
It's not enough to know only one language.
She's a blend girl.
Tom think we can't do that.
I know Tom is a better Tenis player than I.
Tom said he's not mad.
Tom may have done the same thing as Mary did.
I know that Tom is a sophomore.
Tom certainly knew he shouldn't eat that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said that Mary knew John may not have to do that until Monday.
Tom should never have tried that by himself.
How's your father?
My son is not a snob.
I would've let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said that it was harder than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that alone.
I wonder whether it's really hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you've experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said that Mary knew she wouldn't have to do that again.
They swore they would not do that again.
I don't really plan to do that.
I know Tom will let you do that.
Tom said Mary would do that.
They said they won't do that.
Tom think Mary won't do that for John.
Tom said he thought there was a good chance that Mary would do that.
I didn't think Tom would like it.
You're not the only one Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary wasn't done that yet.
They put their notebooks away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn't know that Tom could actually do that.
I didn't say I used to live in Australia.
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that.

I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he would.
Tom said he thought Mary was over thirty.
We went up to the Apparel Stalls to reach two floors.
I don't think Tom's funny.
Tom think he's going to die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know that Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they'd be happy to help.
Tom and I want to go.
I didn't know you told me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I'd be able to do that for Tom.
Tom promised that he would never make such a mistake again.
Don't you think we should talk to Tom about this?
Tom told me that he thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me that he still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't sweat the little things.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it's a very common problem.
Are you sure this will work?
I'm afraid I'll be tied up every afternoon.
I know you can hear me.
You seemed unhappy to do that.
Tom told Mary that she thought she was wrong, but she didn't care what he thought.
The doctor is no longer available.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first-time offender.
I promise you that won't happen.
Tom said that Mary thought she might have to do that.
Tom said he would never try to do that again.
I don't think it ever worked.
Don't forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom has given me a lot of things.
I know Tom is a few years older than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know that Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom admits that he lied to me.
Tom and Mary told John they don't plan on staying at home all day.
Tom doesn't know I still have this.
We're not absolutely sure what we're supposed to do.
We both love Tom.
Tom said he expects you try your best to do that.
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what everyone else wanted to do.
Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that this evening.
I don't think I know the man who's playing drums.
This old man has liver spots on his skin.
Tom and Mary vowed they'd never do that.
Give me that candle.
Tom didn't seem to be aware of what he needed to do.
There's no time to explain.
Tom didn't realize he had to leave.
They said they were scared.

I graduated from Kyoto University.
You're comparing apples and oranges!
Tom said there was still a lot of work to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was embarrassed.
Tom said he thought he was arrested.
Tom and Mary told me they were tired.
I heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to see Mary anymore.
They're living in a fantasy world.
They said they thought I was charming.
I didn't know that Tom was in the hospital.
I don't think you'll have a lot of fun doing that.
I doubt Tom doesn't do that as often as he used to.
I was surprised that Tom didn't know how to do that.
I'm planning to quit lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was scared.
Tom has already told me that he's decided to go to Boston next summer.
That doesn't make sense.
They say they're dying.
Tom offered to pay me some money.
You think Tom would let me do that?
Tom had no idea that Mary didn't know what she was doing.
Tom told everyone that he needed to do that.
I don't think Tom is a native French speaker.
They said they weren't planning to go.
They say they have taught French.
I doubt Tom and Mary are interesting.
I know that Tom knows that I don't have to do that.
You have to help Tom.
Tom told us he had a headache.
The bomb was defused just minutes before it would exploded.
Tom and Mary told me they won, but they didn't.
I'm glad to hear it!
Tom and Mary say they don't know any French.
I don't think we'll find anyone who can help us do that.
You should've refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't like tom dating Mary.
Tom said that's not the main reason why Mary should do that.
Tom doesn't have a car or Mary.
I'm a cat.
I know you don't do that anymore.
Tom said he was no different.
Tom admitted what he said was wrong.
Tom could have been scared.
Who do you think you asked me to give it to you?
I'm just sick.
I hope I get a raise.
Tom said he didn't think we should also think about it.
Tom said he would be coming if we invited him.
I don't think I'll do that.
Tom said he might cry.
It's Sunday.
Tom told me he wasn't tired.
I didn't think anyone really thought Tom was busy.
I think you know we have to do that today.
I didn't think Tom would actually do that.

Everyone knew that Tom didn't like to go to Boston.
Tom said he thought that tomorrow would be a sunny day.
Tom is definitely drunk.
I'm absolutely sure that that's not gonna happen.
Everyone was there except Tom.
I thought you promised to give it to Tom.
I thought you saw Tom this morning.
I think Tom was supposed to be here.
Tom and Mary said they've recovered completely.
I didn't know you were not planning on it by yourself.
I don't think there's any way out of here.
There's no worries without a thorn.
Tom thought Mary probably didn't know John spoke French.
You know I wouldn't do that.
I think we all know that's a bad idea.
I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do.
Tom was probably about three and a half years old at that time.
Tom and Mary said they were Tickliish.
Tom said he would not be able to help the garden today.
I wonder how Tom knew I would be here.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
I'm not sure Tom would let me do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was mean.
So, where's the problem?
Tom didn't think that Mary was beautiful.
He will have to do that work again.
I know Tom didn't know anyone who was able to do that.
Only new veg is sold here.
I believe it's not a good idea.
Tom has already been asked not to do that.
Here's your change.
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew long ago.
When was the last time you asked someone for help?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny.
I know Tom's angry.
I didn't meet anyone new today.
This lake is the deepest in Japan.
I knew Tom was planning to do that.
Tom and I don't speak French.
I thought you were ready.
I know that Tom knew why Mary didn't like to do that.
I didn't think Tom was happy that happened.
They said they were too tired.
You're not too old to get a driver's license, are you?
I don't think there's any harm in telling you now.
I thought you said you did that on Monday.
Everyone here knows Tom is in Boston.
Tom denied he met Mary last week.
That's not why I'm here.
Australia is a seliamentary republic in the middle-Europe and includes nine Bundeslander.
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall.
They said they're not yet thirty.
I didn't think Tom really needed to do that yesterday.
I thought Tom was already back.
Tom said Mary knew she might not be allowed to do so unless John did it with her.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were pleased.
Tom said that Mary thought John might be needed to do that.
Tom told me that he didn't want Mary to do that.
I thought Mary was cute.
Tom think Mary will not be able to do that by herself.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy.
Did Tom say he stayed in Australia?
Tom said he'd pay for everything.
They told me they were not alone.
I don't think I can finish the job alone.
Tom said Mary's not safe.
Tom said I saw the thinner more than the last time he saw me.
They said they'd see me tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was concerned.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's gonna do this afternoon.
Tom paid someone to do that.
I thought Tom would be a cooperation.
Tom told me he was safe.
Tom said I should go to Boston with you.
They think they know what to do.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be scared.
Tom and I are very proud of you.
I knew how to show Mary how to do that if she asked him.
We can't prove Tom is normal.
Tom's amused.
Tom should never have tried that alone.
Tom and Mary said they'd never do that.
I'm more than him.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was a protective.
Tom said he probably wouldn't want Mary to do that on a cold day like this today.
The teacher's room and the gym are under reunion.
You think there's any chance you'll be able to do that?
Tom set his glass down.
You'd think that would have impressed Tom.
This is the first time I bought a newspaper in this city.
That's a good question.
Without water, we cannot exist.
Tom definitely understands that we all need to attend today's meeting.
Tom and Mary said they didn't agree with that.
I know Tom will help us do that.
I had three hours before lunch.
Tom said he appreciated Mary's help.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
You're the only one who can protect them.
Can someone explain this to me?
Did you know that Tom was going to be in Boston all week?
Tom and Mary told me they wanted a dog.
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other.
I know that Tom didn't know I was not going to do that.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't have to do that himself.
Tom has a lot of things he needs to do.
Tom and Mary say they're not sure they're ready.
There is no logical reason for this.
I suspected Tom was infected.
I hope I gave you enough money to buy everything you needed.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary was enjoying that.
They said they felt good.
I wish you didn't see me do that.
Tom and Mary said they had no money.
I don't think I need to tell Tom to do that.
Tom should never get that job.
Tom told Mary that she was his only one.
Tom knew he wouldn't be expelled.
Tom was convinced that Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said he knew what Mary had to do.
I think you're freaking.
I wonder if Tom's going to Boston next week.
Tom says he didn't know that Mary would not go to Australia unless he went with her.
I know Tom doesn't want to do that.
You're not a fool.
I think Tom doesn't often win when he plays chess.
Tom said he didn't know Mary wasn't able to speak French very well.
Tom said he knew Mary would win the race.
I know Tom came to Australia last week.
Tom said Mary wasn't mad.
I think we've bought everything we need.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't have to do that himself.
Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it.
I think Tom is average.
You're not just working for Tom.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might have to do that by himself.
I don't think Tom knows how it happened.
It's not a watch.
Tom and Mary said they're unrestrained.
I'm from the United States.
I don't think Tom knows how to have a good time.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
Tom seems to be unrealistic to correct his mistakes.
I loved that book!
Tom said Mary would not like to do that.
Tom said he felt safe.
Tom is homeick.
Did you know that would happen?
I think Tom believed me.
I don't think we can do that by 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary would probably not do that.
I thought you said we weren't going to do that anymore.
I know that Tom doesn't know anyone who is able to do that.
I'm sure Tom has a girlfriend.
I thought you might be the only person who would listen to me.
I know that Tom didn't know Mary did that.
Tom said he thought Mary would be nervous.
That's the guitar I want to buy.
I think Tom did it.
See you tomorrow morning!
They told me they were ambidetruck.
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary has to do that.
I really thought Tom would change his mind.
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped buying a chocolate bar.
I doubt Tom's gonna be excited about that.
I didn't know I was supposed to help Tom do that.
Whatever you say, I'm sure I'm right.
Tom said he didn't need any more help.
We cannot change our schedule.
I was surprised when I heard that Tom was arrested.
Tom and Mary probably don't know they're not supposed to park there.
I thought you could use a friend.
You're not really gonna kill Tom, are you?
They said they'd be willing to help us.
Tom told me he did that.
Tom's not the same as he was 30 years ago.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this today.

It's not too hard.

If you do that, I'll do it too.

What book did you give to Tom?

It's not over.
Tom said he was frustrated.
I know Tom's gonna do that with Mary.
I sent Mary some roses.
Tom said Mary was better than her sister.
I wasn't as hungry as Tom.
Will you pay me your dictionary?
I buy things I know I'm not going to use.
Tom claims he didn't kill anyone.
Tom and Mary said that they were very grateful.
How are you doing today?

I've been busy yesterday.

Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't done it.
I doubt Tom would have to do that.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
I'm not busy as I was last year.
I would have talked to Tom instead of just ignore him.
I thought you wanted to meet my family.
I don't think Tom will be disobedient.
Tom said he was gonna do that every day after he retired.
There's nothing I can do to help, I'm afraid.

What's her problem?
I think Tom's focused.
I'm not interested in this.
I thought the police were looking for Tom.
