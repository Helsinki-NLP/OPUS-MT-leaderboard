For Karen out of the Vales: The twp in the Valesh means pung and pwp.
A PLAD AM said their group was "never" and suggested alternatives.

It's like the English alphabet of the Valesh Hutch W.

Not both of them today.
He's capable of hiding Barz.
People today's going to meet in different ways.
Barz is no longer sitting in more palaces where people regularly went.
As far as the church houses are concerned, the money that's received from the rich will not be long, as the patriots expect, and they will stand where they went.
He added that the churches can replace the condominum parents, which will be filled with people who do not help the rest of the survival sites in the area.
He said, "It's a large number of people who buy Kandominium will have a white farm, and they will have a role in shutting down these churches immediately because it is likely that those who migrate to the Condominum will become members of their churches."

Mr. Winder said St. Martin didn't change it.

The government's director of the Paris Department of the Common Regime, Vissi, wrote to the priest's relative in July that the related Arctics and the parliaments sent by the colleagues would put up on the charts on the vistas, although they were not to fill them.
Some of the parasites complained about the treatment of the relationship.
Shark wounded a 13-year-old child for jagging fish in California.
The government officials said that the first day of the week, the Shark fish attacked a 13-year-old boy when he was smuggling to catch a fish in California.
This attack occurred before 7 o'clock in the Becken Center in Insanity.

The economy in Sanjar is going to be in the time when the spaces of the supermarkets shelf were ever used to use TV, microvio and home artwork.
Sensebri said he'll double the size of some 3,000 copies, such as Railon, such as Tozeermen, and Dr. Pie.
Al-Aurel, Mee Blanine and British Bees present present offers special spaces for the building, as in Bots' bags.
Supermarquet is also re-starting his bottic MC-up so that more artifacts are in harmony with the wishes of the savage chewers - something that young people are demanding most of the buyers.
And on the other hand, Gambo Retiller will also test the subjects in two senior strategies, which last week opens in the Khordon region of the first South London, and the second switch will open to Seli Oak in Bermangam after that year.
Changing the idea of buying daily food from online buyers and local markets means that the supermarkets have to do more to rob people of their daily food.
Chaff Eggsikito Mike Cup of Sanzambery said that their hats would be like the most deputy surveillance surveillances while the Supermarket China is competing with more people and non-profits.
Sensebri also puts Argos in his hundreds of stores, and several hebbites have also distributed since he bought both Chinas two years ago.
The former attempt to reset the sapmarquet's sympathy and the formulas of the Singapore and Farmish has failed.
Sensebri had tried a conservation with Booths in the right of 2000, but it ended after the resignation of the Camist Stones in his submarines.
This new wisdom has come at the time when Sensebri sold his $125 million pounds on the price of his 281st Story's $125 million.

Alis Der Lamont, BBC Scott in Tony Marcioni Erina
A unique performance and result for Leongstein.
For a person, they were powerful, who were trying to show more than persistent expectations in the highway.
The stali and the team's party have changed very little since they've returned to the street, but the real reward goes to Hoult, who built the team after their arrival.
It's all heroes.
Captain Holkit was strong, which made a very beautiful reservoir, while Magague puts the walls on the pants during the whole game.
But he wasn't enthusiastic in Rengers.
The best they've been living in Jarard's position, they can't meet those standards.
They didn't have control over the gang and could only start against the host once -- and it's a danger for the keepers when they're in the middle of the school table.

And indeed, what We have done is upon the Book of Decree.
One of the most important choices in our time is five weeks away.
He said: "This is a grave thing: I am not there to stand (in it), but I am not a partner, and I fight therein for the sake of those who are staunch (of Allah's Sovereignty)."

Leeber wasn't going to be a big galaxy house.
It does not bear with those who speak in their heart
It wasn't a surprise when the ministers in my local party calculated the suggestion to blame me.
Finally, I'm growing up in the list of Liberal Araqin Parliament, who's said we're not interested - so we're talking about the heart.
My Parliament partner Rean also faced the same attitude because they stood up against Judaism.
In my case, the criticism prompted me to blame me for refusing to agree with Jeremy Corbon.
On the importance of the responsible financial policy, on national peace, on Europe, on the same amount that Jeremy does not agree with the former states.
For the meeting of Natnagam Est Leber on Friday, the note says, "We want to make meetings ceremony and burrow"
That's exactly the same thing as my eight-year-old meeting in the evening of the week.
Sadly, today, many meetings haven't been held, and "the word of gentle and gentleness of politics has been forgotten for a long time, of course, if it ever started.
It's obviously clear that the opposition in the Liberation Party is not being endured, and every opinion is seen in the case of whether it is acceptable for party leadership.
That has happened immediately after Jerome became a leader, because those who once thought that I had a political view of myself have started to take me to the U Train and expect me to take a stand that would never conflict with other people - whether national peace or EU Singh Marquet.
When I talk in public - whatever I say - Social Medieval rains begin in social media and demand for disappointment and I'm told I should not be in the Liberation Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm more happy than some of my friends because of the comments about me.
I am surprised to see the competitive ability and determination of the colleagues who per day endure violence on the basis of sexual and racial prejudice, but do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the state of this distant state is how the survival levels have been made to be irrelevant.
JEREME Corbian claimed that the Leeber Party should promote the tradition of endurance.
The fact is that we haven't been in that vast surgeon home and every time, the party seems to be more difficult with the change of trust or the change of choice.
In the last two years, I was very encouraged to put my head down, if I don't become so clear, then I'll be "always."
But I didn't come to the state to do so.
Since 32 years before I became a teacher of a school, I had a high-handed high school, since my company was near the school, I have taken the lead in Liberia, I have tried to make the best public service for those who need more than they - regardless of the local colonial or government agent.
I never hid my politics in the past.
No one in Natnagam East has ever been confused with my colleagues and current leadership.
Concerning those who moved to the meeting, only I will say that when the country is on the bugs, the gamma will be damaged by families, businesses, and our public service, I don't want to lose time and energy when I prove my loyalty to the Lebert Party.
But just a message that I'm not just Nattangam Muslim but I'd like to give Dedan the opinions of my crew, whether laber's crew or not: I'm proud of your service, and I promise you that no amount of reproduction threats or political instability will prevent me from doing what I think is the best of you all.

'Seager is ours: I hope to reopen the way from Bolivia's hug to the beach.
Circles in Lapje are returning around the Headquarters of India.
It's a blue janda blending on the government buildings.
It's written on the bees from Titicaca to Amazon: "We have our rights on the seashore.
"It's our duty to take it back."
It's still refreshing to remember the loss of a blood transfusion in the 19th and the desire to travel to the sea in the ocean.
Now these expectations are now on the highest level in several days, while Bolivia is waiting for international justice after five years.
Roberto Colzadala, a professor of Bolivia, said that Bolivia has the power, the spirit of unity, and a positive view of the result.
In many cities of Bolivia, ICJ will see the decision of the large Scythians in the country of Bolivia, hoping that he will judge for the charges of Trabian Bolivia in Hagg, after a number of deforestations, she will be responsible for her collaboration to the sea.
The president Evo Moralie, who was a Bolivia, also had to make a lot of effort to make the decision to the Soviet Union.
They were determined in August that their country was close to the coastal border.
But some scientists think it's impossible to judge the jurisdiction, and if it does, there will be no big change.
In Hinland, the United Nations has no right to hand over the country to the constitution of the United Nations, and he has decided that they will not determine the result of the possible holidays.
In the International Law, a technical surgeon named Pazpatta said, "ICJ's decision is being issued only six months after hearing the last garbage."
Instead of promoteing Bolivia's purpose, it may have been damaged by the past four years.
Saharata said that the current administration of Bolivia has made the problem to reach the sea.
He said that the Moores' debate has also eliminated the rest of the manslayer's surgeon's story.
Bolivia and Goi can continue to talk at a time, but it'll be very difficult.
Both countries have not changed from 1962.
The former President Edwardo Rodridges Voltzee, who is represented by Bolivia in Hag, has rejected the idea that the decision to judge was inevitable.
He said on Monday, a unique opportunity to start a new period of relationship with Bolivia and to end the 139 years of AIDS for the sake of mutual benefit.
Calzedilla acknowledged that the Morals are still one of the most popular decades in Latin America, using the sea problem as political support.
He said: "O you people, I will never be able to reach the eastern border."
The decision of the court is an opportunity to highlight the need to forget the past.

John Edward: Privileges for Global citizens
The free school school record in Scotland, and the record continued with a wonderful test of 2018, which has been built in the activities of sports, phonographs, music, and other Community.
With more than 30,000 interested people in the whole Scottland, this school represents the Scottish Console of Andpent Schools (SCIS), trying to provide the best level of service to the students and parents.
Free schools prepare their students for their position as the next and higher education, their chosen carrier and world citizens.
As a teacher who can prepare and apply a better school, we see modern languages as a popular and appealing article in schools.
Nelson Mandila said: If you speak to someone in a language he understands, he goes to his head.
If you speak to someone in your own language, it gets in his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot only rely on the English to establish relationships and trusts with people from other countries.
With the results of the recent test of this year, we can see the languages above the lag tables in free schools.
68 percent of the students of foreign languages received Hair Grade A.
SCIS's 74-center schools show that 72 percent of the hypergrade found in Mandarian, while 72 percent of German readers, 69 percent of French readers and 63 percent of Spanish readers.
It shows that free schools in Scotland support special skills as foreign languages that children and young people certainly need in the future.
The languages now have the same position as STEM articles (Sines, Technology engineering and regulations) as the elections of free schools and other places.
In 2014, a survey from the U.S. Communist and Practical Department found that 17 percent of the languages have been reduced to a lack of education for the problems in the world.
So the language skills in preparing young people for their future carrier are becoming more disloyal.
As more job opportunities are needed, these skills are needed in today's world.
No matter Carrier's Chanwo, if someone has learned another language, they'll have real benefits in the future because they're learning another language.
Haud has been able to talk to people from foreign countries to the people who are able to do the right thing.
You Gov Polle, in 2013, over 4,000 British adults were not able to speak a foreign language so well and French is the only language spoken by two Hindus, 15 percent.
That's why children today need to spend a lot of time in the language.
Many languages, as special developments, increases the prospects of having a good day for children.
In the middle of Scotland, different languages are read in each school.
Various schools facilitate more classical languages, while others read languages that are the most important idea for Britain, such as Mandarean or Japan.
Anything your child likes, free schools will always be available in many languages and will be a skilled technique in this area.
The Scottish free schools are determined to provide a educational environment that will prepare and prepare children with necessary skills to succeed in the future.
In the world's commercial environment of this time, languages can't be rejected as important for the future of the country, so it should be in a clear education.
Of course, modern languages should be viewed as "an international comprehensive skill."
The free school school will continue to present the choice, speculation and distinction for young people in Scotland.

Ryder Cup 2018: I'm determined to stand up for hopes to go to the Singapore of Team U.S.A.
After three consecutive sessions, the dead of this rider Cup was the second afternoon of the week.
The amount of steaming steam is a perfectly designed game, but a imagination in which the players believe in their heart, and that will never happen as much as they do.
And they will say, “Where is this promise?”
On that day, the Jordan Spaith said, "They had six pounds, and now four is left, so I think we're taking it as a little amount."
Of course, Europe's got higher, four points ahead when they can try to get more times.
As the speaker said, the American feels that they have a little reconstruction and that they have enough to be hoped, as special special speciality and steams, who played all day together and each got three pounds of pounds.
The Gandhi is being spied in the jungle, and they have set an example.
When their Round was moving, the voices were rising up high when they threw the ball into the ring with the sleeve, four from four to four, and then they named their name when they were behind two pounds after the two pounds.
Their bullets sweeped them on 15 days, so the loud voices of the monkeys were thrilled, in a way that tells you that American teams haven't been out of the way.
Speech says you're just going to have to work hard and worry about it.
It's just that every one of those players is gone.
There's only 18 hotels left.
In the last two days, the only player in France is the Malianari and Tommy Philetwood, a Muslim story of the Reider Cup.
It's awesome, but it's a lovely pair perfect and they don't expect a mistake.
"Mullywood" was the only couple who didn't bother each week's afternoon, but they'd have been shot by the week's morning, the afternoon of the week, and then the afternoon morning.
This race and the way their energy moves from the stormy jokes and to them makes it strong that they are the only player who will be able to wait on Sunday, and there will be no popular player besides them, who can be sure of the possible victory of the U.S. team when the sun goes down on the Golfon.
Preferredly both at different levels.
The beauty of Europe is the time before, yet.
Boba Watson and Wib Sampson finished her work in the morning when her shoes were with Alex Norron.
In the first nine holes, a bubble and two dolls threw Spanish and Swedish couple into a hole where they could never get out.
Sunday, however, there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
What they don't give, what they don't give, and in the way wisdom changes in a period of time, it's very good to see the morning hair and the morning showers.
To this day, Europe's team has shown a good game as a team and has maintained its superiority to the last day, but this exposure has shown that the team is also encouraged to fight, some of which are doubting as special seat sites.
The last day of the Rider Cup, Europe's top is 10-6.
On the weekly weekend on the United States, when the top 10-6th of the European Red Cup will be a clear triumph.
Tommy Flytwood and Francisco Moulinari's proposal started with two conflicts on the Tyegro vodes, and Lee took his telescope to four pounds in the Gulf National.
The European team of Thames Biron, which is coached to keep his triangle in Hezeltin two years ago, was at the U.S. team and lived in the survival of the U.S.A. and from 3-1.
U.S. did more resistance to the Forms and live two Mays, but could not achieve the loss.
Eight pounds are required to keep the triangle team of JAM Ferick's team on Sunday 12 snugs.
The first block of the Flatwood European team was the first of four pounds (flowers) who obtained four pounds, while their joints were with the "Moliwwd" that was the first match in the history of Raider Cook after the "Moliwd."
After the Wads and Patrick Red in the Forebes, they were in the best position to defeat the Wissin Dachumbeau, who had been defeated by the United States, as well as the attacks of the deadly devastated Wads and the Americans.
Woods, who successfully succeeded in two continents of weekends, made a show of controversy, but they lost 19 in 29 of their photo hairs and Forms and seven times.
Justin Day, who had rested in the face of the explosives in the morning, returned to support Hank Stanson in the Forums, and Dustin Johnson and Burkes Kopko - whose world is the first and third - defeated from 2.1 to 2.
The team in Paris, Europe's Southwest region, could not accept their vows in a pleasant and winding day.
Three times the Great Champion winner, Jordan Spith and Junton Thummus set a standard for the Americans on the week.
He won the lives of Spain and the In Polluter in the Fore Bells, and later he defeated Potter and Mixer from 400 ° C.
In the history of Rider Cup, only two times a team went into the Singaps is back in the game after four pounds have been lost, although the facility of the Fairak team needed to just measure the triangle.
After staying in the second number for two days, but it seems that the answer attack will be out of their reach.
The North Korea says it's "nothing can be born" without trust.
The U.S. government of North Korea has told the United States on the weekend that their country's trust in the United States is inhibited by the bans and that their country is not in a state of universality.
Rying Hun told the world's annual General Assembly that the last year the North Korea has taken up the "spiritual speculations of slogans", such as cutting the sites of the Atomic Technologies, and blocking the opports and the spreading of the Atomic Technologies.
They said, but we don't see the US responding to it.
Without trusting in the United States, our national peace will not be trusted, and we will not be alone in any situation.
While Rye repeated the complaints of Washington's resistance to the power of the "Memorial" Atymous Issalah's act, their account seems to seem to haven't turned out to be the same as Pawong or Pawang.
Rie spoke to the U.S. President of the United States and North Korea, who was the first head of the U.S. conference between them, after the first head of the U.S. convenience, who made a promise to “pure the Coramental Army weapons” when Termita promised to guarantee the peace of North Korea’s peace.
North Korea wants to end the war in 53-1950, but the United States has said that Pyong Jong will have to put his intimacy weapons first.
Washington also resisted the need to soften the harsh international restrictions on North Korea.
Ree said, the United States first complains about the "Eternal Attami Socialist" and the geographically increases pressure through restrictions for its purpose, and the fact that "declaring the end of the war" is also arbitrary.
The idea that restrictions can force us to be swayed is one of those who don't know about us.
But the problem is that restrictions are increasing in confidence.
Rie did not mention any other headship plan to meet in the middle of the short and tormap, which the U.S. President of U.S. was evacuated in the United States before.
Instead, the Wizard did not have a smaller number in the past five months, and the leader of South Korea, Man, especially mentioning three visits between them, and said: "If the problem of this survival was not a party of South Korea, it would not have been the case in South Korea, not in the United States."
Nevertheless, Rye's speech was different from the last year's talk, when he told the General Assembly of the United Nations that the "Messster of Satan" Terrace has become "a man who is stamped on a suicide campaign" after the North Korea Racks have become the state of the United States.
Torpee, who threatened North Korea the last year to be "full of full destruction", commended less on taking measures to the United States, but said that there is still a lot of work and that it should continue to be restricted from the North Korea.
Buddha said he didn't have time for it, and it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three or five months.
China and Russians reason that the United Nations Peace Consol should repay Pyong Young for the efforts of those who will be raised to the United Nations.
However, the U.S. Secretary of the United States, Mike Pompio, said to the United Nations Peace Consolation Consequently, "Let's continue until we get the goal of a complete, permanent and confirmation of the Constitutional State."
Peace Consell has contributed to the controversy in North Korea by attempting to block the tips for the pyong Jong and the Beltic Massiillal programs.
Pompio met RIA at the General Assembly's sidelines in the United States, and then told him that he would visit Pong Jong next month to prepare the second head meeting.
Pompio has already been visiting North Korea three times this year, but their last visit was not good.
In July he said he was released, but only after a few hours, North Korea condemned them to be "spoken like garbage."
North Korea promised me to end a millennium and an atomic company with me if the United States picks up the "Jobisms" by the United States.
He said, “The only one who told them is, ‘There will be peace in whatever they wish,’ in which the Tampa made a promise of peace, and in the case of Washington.
Participating in the course of a hardworking surgeon's sleep
Harvard University this year urged all of his industrious graduates to get more sleep in a new course so that Kaphine could be able to cope with the growth of the mathematical practice by "going to sleep all night."
One educator learned that the first number of students in the world is often unwittingly unwittingly when things are the most important thing to be considered.
Harvard Medical School's professor and bad gam and vanus has prepared a specialist Charles SCSerler, which says it's the first coordination in the United States.
After a talk on the lack of sleep on reading, they were moved to start the course.
He told the third grade, ‘A girl came to me at the end of this quantity and said, ‘ Why is this going to be said when I'm in my serial year?’
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - a fact that surprised me.
This course, which began the first time in the year, explains how gold’s good habits help in education and sports and improve their efficiency.
In Harvard Medical School, professor and agency director of the University's health in the University of Harvard Medical and University, the U.S. director Paul Brara said that after knowing that the desire to have a severe sleep during the week, the ventures were decided to get out of sleep during the week.
It's a clue of communicating tasks in the course of an hour.
In a segment, there is a picture of a hospital room with the effects of the caffeine and light and how the lack of sleep affects the performance of sports, and clicks on enough papers, papers, tracts, and books to learn the importance of gold.
In another segment, sharers are told how long sleep increases the risks of heart, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of Campus encourages the students to think about their daily activities.
Paul Ciser added, we know that this will not change the attitude of the seeker immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking when you choose it.
He said that there is still the custom of being proud of the "paying the night" and added that today's technologies and increasing pressures are a growing problem of sleep.
They said you're sure you're sleeping well in a measure of sleep, stress, tiredness, and stress - the need to be ‘the secret weapon’ - even to escape from Motapa, because sleepless brains surplus hunger, so they feel hungry.
A 19-year-old student Remond Sou, who is learning the education of Camie and Medical Science, has helped Professor Paul Seser to prepare a class in his first year in Harvard.
He said that Corress opened his eyes and made peace in him to try to start the classes in the whole camp.
He hopes to complete the same educational program before all post graduates are joined in the constitutional conference.
Professor Cezler suggests that the seeker should consider when to go to bed and when to wake up, and they should be aware of the effects of 'Neli Light' which comes out of the British surgeons and LED lights.
Victory from a military officer at Lewangstan’s registration: Magaguay killed Jarward’s players with a bullet
Rengers were also troubled when a hundred of Dula Magas attacked a bullet against the unrepentant team of Steven Jerserard in Lewongston.

The Magaga has shot seven minutes ago, and the unrestrained Regress team has never been able to brave it.
While Rengers are at the sixth number, Lewangston has been sliding on the third number and only behind a bullet.
There may be more problems for Jayerard when it looks like throwing something out of the rest of the country.
Jaird made eight changes in his team so that IrBetford reached the semi-finals of the Irish.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11 who gave a point from Hertes last week, and he'll be happy to see how his opponent's movement overturned the breath of his opponents.
Maybe the Rengers could remain Hawaii, but Levongstein put gands in his control.
They could only smart within two minutes of the start of the game, since the first time that Magazine was in the United States, Scott Pottman hit the Gulf of Gand Allen McGreger, but the media saved time.
By the time of the Kyattan Creg Holocaust, Kyoto came up to Kyattán, but his defense was to throw the party, Alan Lethong Gad just to the beck post.
Rangers must have got control on the game, but in the last third part there could be only hoped about their game.
Alfredo Morolus must have felt that on the third hour of the night, he was found on a pencil when he and Steven Lassi broke down, but the refrigerator Steeon Thomson was overturned by colporteurs.
Rangers could only have two shots at the hospital first in Haf, but Cali's former bullet caper in Ambukus had no problem with Lassa Colely's head of Lasana College and Ovi Ajaria's weak shot.
While Levy could be against the Opinor game at 34 minutes, no one can deny that it was their necessities.
Once again, Rengers failed to sneak out of the jerks' tricks.
Scott Afred wasn't reacting at the time when Delawan Guilder threw the Gand Scott Rabinson and chose to finish his trick with coolness.
In time, Gerald replaced Rayan Kent, and this change showed almost a quick effect when the vonger blew Moriolus, but the affected Kelly ran away from his leg to stop it.
But Lewongston continued to force the guests to play their own game when Lithuania and Holocaust were playing the long-length after the other long-bishes.
The Hot team could increase his lad in the last stage when Lithgaro threw the head to the Hender Jackbes, but Mike Gregor failed his efforts.
Glen Medalton, the Regressor of Regeneration, claimed the delay of a penalty when he joined Jakebs, but Thomson ignored it.

When you use it, you can actually hear the effects of the infectious atoms in the world."
Awanz: "Yes, really it's up!"
"Hans" Gegger died a few days before his 63th anniversary in 1945.
But their name is still alive.

The professor of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, Bethsda, in myland, said: "Our results show that we have a very optimistic victory now.
Professor Burzofky suggested that HER2 is a cause of the efficiency of some types of cancer, including the steel, the child, the casino, and the cancer.
It has also been successful in one of the practical treatments of a psychologist Leoquimia who has been able to “separate ” the use of antibiotics and to prevent cancer cells.

But how successful has the Global Citizen been in fulfilling his mission while now only 12 years remain?
Does the idea of giving free concert to people is a real way to convince people to take practical steps, or is another form of 'kacty adventure', in which people think they're saying they're doing a lot of work on an online phonograph or a tweet?

A question on your website is, "What forces you to think that we can eliminate severe poverty?"
Global Statistics said: This is a long and difficult journey-- we'll fall and fail.
But, like the motivations against citizen rights and racial prejudice, we are successful, because together we are more powerful.

Twenty-year-old Tom said he didn't feel that "nobody was like me."
While discussing the series of radios from Larine Lauren, he said that we're talking about the rights of sexists.
He said that being a father, he was uncomfortable about winning Olympics.
A long-term surgeon's regular precision of Shoe has taken several months because of disease.
As shown in Laurion's first program, Deli said that he grew up with the feeling that he was "better than everyone" because it was not socially acceptable for boys and girls."
She said, to this day, the feelings of less-behavior and the feeling of being different gave me strength and ability to succeed.
She said that she wanted to prove that she was something, so she never despaired of anyone when she finally learned about her kind.
Two times in Olympics, the winner winner has become an LGBT worker in a highway in Olympics, and this year he uplifted from other countries in Kamman Walth Gams to get us to know the nature of nature.
He said he's speaking clearly because he feels happy that he was able to live a prosperous life without knowing and wants to comfort others.
Three times the world champion said that a man, an American movie film, was surprised to meet him in 2013, was arrested in love.
Delee married the last year with Escar Everd, a 20-year-old Dustin, but never got a difference of age.
He said that when you had to pass so young, he went to Olympics at the first age of 14 and died three years after his father died because of cancer.
In June these couples became parents of Robert R. Black-Dilly son, and Deli said that he changed his life.
He said, "If you had talked to me about the past year, I would have been about to win all my words of gold."
Do you know that there are more things to win the gold of Olympic?
My Olympic gold is beautiful.

He said, "I didn't tell them, Dad, you're not alive to sit in the next row.
He said, “I seized them, and when he had taken the last breath, I continued with them until he had taken the last breath, and I believed he would not be disappointed.”
The next year, Deli joined the Olympics in 2012 and won the Consequences.
He said that I just knew that I had dreamed of him all the days of life - I had to go to the house in some Olympic Games, and I didn't know better than that.
He also moved to choose his first dimension - from Proud to the north - who kept his mind in his mind while preparing for Olympics and still sweeping his robot.

Att of Farm Millson was added to the Red Cup on the weekend
The American Flickr will set up a record when they'll play their 47-white Red Cup match, but they're going to have to restore their farm to avoid establishing a disgusting stone.
McClin, who is playing 12 times a record every six months, has been added to a week's phone hairs and Forms from Captain Jim Fairk.
Instead of becoming the main focus of the people, who often lived for the United States, five times a great champion winner, McClin, distributed his game to work on the role of a chair leader and to remove his weaknesses.
They can't even throw all the straight balls in their carrier, so 48-year-old drivers are not supposed to be a coordinator of the Golf National, where the long-term land is severely punished by the wrong shats.
And even though Corress is not as hard as they are, McClintin will be with the British Oppon Chimpans Francisco Malinarie, who has joined Tommy Philetwood in the same week.
If the Americans who are on the devastation of four pounds start at the beginning of the 12 snacks, it can be really important.
Fairk expressed confidence in his player.
Fairk said he understands his work today, put his back on my back, and put his arms around me, and said he's ready for tomorrow.
He's absolutely trusting himself.
She's accommodated and in the past, and this week she has given them a lot.
I probably didn't think he would play two jokes.
I thought more than that, but what was to happen was to happen, and maybe we thought so.
Like every other player, he wants to be in the field.
He will play the Sunday and break the record of the most good raids of Ryder Cup.
It may end his radar cap, but it's not a match with its infrared records.
McClin has been successful 18 times, 20 times failing and seven times equal to the harbor, although Fairk said that his presence has made a lot of fun for the team.
He explained that he's a smart, tanza, smart, and like to smuggl with people, and the life of the team's room.
I think young players enjoy it, and this was also a great pleasure.
It gets much more than a game.
European Captain Thames Bayers know the large lad may soon end
Europe’s Captain Thomas Bayers know from their experience that there may be a lot of big blood levels in the last day of the Red Cup can easily change into anxiety.
The Danish player started his carrier in 1977 in Walderma, which had a team above five pounds in the company of Civo Balsavus, but when they reached the end of the line, they were smart with 141⁄2-131.
The bierine said you remind yourself that we had a big Led in Walderama, we had a big Led in Brooklyn Line, where we were defeated and we lived in Valdrumma, but with a very few Marines.
So history was told to each one in the team that the matter hasn't ended yet.
Today, with complete preparation, we go to the field tomorrow.
Going there and doing everything right.
It doesn't end until you get the point on the board.
We have a hazard, and it's that this triangular life and all our attention is focused on it.
I always said I'll focus on 12 players of my side, but we're well aware that we're the best players on the other side of the world.
Rejoicing to the performance of my players on a hard glolf course, the bierine added: I never did it.
We'll have to get a different blade tomorrow.
Tomorrow there will be an influential performance that will be evident, and it's a different thing to do.
When I'm in a plane, it's nice to be in the field with a partyer, but when you're alone, you're going to test your whole capacity as a bullfre.
That's the message that you're going to make the players fully and enjoy their full potential.
Now you're leaving your partyer behind, and he'll have to go and show your full potential.
In contrast with the opposing number of brewers, Jim Faork expects to be more effective than their players, Massaya Jordon Spithi and Jin Thums who took three pounds from four of them.
Fairk himself lived on both sides of these unprecedented unprecedented changes on the last day, after he became part of the Futhar team in Brooklyn Line, he had to be defeated when the European team received the "Medina".
When he was asked how he took his players to the last day in 1999, he replied: "I remember every word of it.
Tomorrow we'll be 12 important meters, but you'll want to get to the fast start as you saw in Brooklyn line, just as you saw in the media.
When the amount goes on one side, she pressures the middle beach.
We set our lines up according to it, and we place our players in this way to show some magic tomorrow.
Thummus has been targeted by an attack of the answer and with Rory McCast, and Paul's collaboration with other Europeans in the Ruri Microy, Jim Day, Jin Palm, Tom Plot Wood, and Ion Polter, and Lane-Line Haff.
The bierine said about his snugs, that I put my players in this order because I understand it's full of game.
Once again in the new warship in Germany
In 2014, the new Frequentt of the German Brethren had to be commuted to replace the ships of the winter war, but that would not be less than the next year, according to local media, it is the cause of neutisms and Hosharras.
The Die Zeit newspaper reported that the first ship of the new Bandon-Virtomburg class was now composed of the "Ranland Falls" in the first stage of 2019.
The plane was to join in the ocean in 2014, but what problems of Delari have caused this volcanic project to be damaged.
Bandon-Virtemburg class's four ships that Arder Bahraya gave in 2007 to replace the Fregits of the old Bremen class.
It is thought that these ships will be built on a powerful tomato, different types of airplane symmetricals, and the airplanes, such as Redwood Reddress, Infrared, and Soitis.
Other important attributes include the longest period of the Mantannis -- the modern Indian Freguts can be set out from their monarchy for two years.
However, the Dy Zeit has indicated that they will continue to be able to show German their power beyond the sea during these modern modern war ships.
At least F125 Fregut last year, when Germany's seam refused to force the ship and sent it back to Baloam and Shap Yard in Hamburg.
It's the first time that the sea returned a ship after Deliro.
There was very little information about the reasons for the return, but German media referred to "Softwears and Hardware" that would make the war ship unacceptable if it was set on the promotion.
The secrets of the software were especially important because the board's ships were to operate only 120 surgeons, which were nearly half of the population of the old Breman class's ships.
It also appeared that the ship’s weight was too large that limits the ability to add upgrades to its performance and to the future.
It is thought that 77,000 tons of Ton Vazni, the Land Falls, used by Germans in the second world war, is doubled by the ships of the same class.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the education of the entire project has also become a problem.
It's said that its waste is over 2.2 billion billine Yur (3.6 billion dollars).
Recently, the value of the new Fregits’ problems is increasing in the light of the German epidemic.
In the beginning of this year, Hans Peter Battles, head of German Parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the ship was lost by ships that could be set up.
The prosecutor said that this problem has been serious with time, because the old ships were bleeded, but their replacement was not provided.
They complained that the Bandon-Virtomburg class was unable to join any of the Freeget classes.
Experts of National Trest’s Secret Life
The purpose of a new research found in Scotish Haylands is to determine how the chimgads use natural design to find food.
It's hoped that its results will make new light on the behavior of these poor animals and guide the activities of the future.
The National Trest Fort Scotland’s scientists include the common and symposium study of the Enervoe Guards in the U.S.
In the weather, special recorders will be placed in the most important areas in the area to record the activities of the spectators.
The NHS's activist and volunteers will act in the mobile server.
The magnetic sound of all recordings will inform the frequency and what kind of types are being done.
To prepare a detailed picture of their behavior, the monster's map and report will be rebuilt.
For NTS, the agents of natural security hoped that the results would show what is most important for the chimgads and how they are used for every kind of type.
This information will help to establish the survival of the boom's management, such as chemgads and other types of kinds and to determine the benefits of maintaining the woods.
During the past century, in Scotland and Britain, the population of the spectacular population has been reduced.
Their citizens are in danger of building and development work that affects their architects and their son Boom.
Without the air pressures and lights, some of the film papers and some of the building materials are also dangerous to them.
The chimgads aren't really blind.
However, because of the habit of hunting by night, their ears are better than their eyes when they catch a hunter.
She uses a vio-location technique to locate the carcasses and obstacles in the way of her protein.
NTS, over 270 historyal buildings, 37 major gardens and 76,000 hexagons are responsible for the care of the earth.

The organization has set eight in the form of the ten chicks of the Threv State in Damfiz and Gluve.
Stat's manager David Thumpsen said that the State is the best place for them.
He said we have a beautiful place for the spectators here in Threve.
We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and a good stomach.
But there are many things that we can't know about, so what we're doing here or in other places will help us to understand what they need to do.
They bravely said that in the buildings there is a need to locate chimgares before the work is started, because it is possible that a steel molecule can kill 400 people and children, perhaps they are an entire local population.
Champagadas are safe and destroying them, threatening, torture, or destroying their objects is illegal.
The Bat Conservation Trest has encouraged the public to help.
They said: "We know very little about the people of hamstrung, and we do not know how many their people are."
Ronaldo's sexual insolence will be advocated when the lawyer will protest against the German Army.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the claims of sexual abuse against him ‘the news’ and said that people want to be known by his name.
His prosecutor will protest against German Gerrid Dare Speech, who issued charges.
A U.S. woman named Catherine Mae Yurga claims that in 2009, a hotel in Los Vegas, U.S.A.
Dar Spegger reported that Ronaldo was accused of paying catherine to remain silent about the incident.
After a few hours after the charge was issued, the Instigam Leo radio was introduced to his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronalds ignored the news as ‘the news.’
He said, "No, no, no."
Five times Baloon D.O. said to Camera what they're saying is 'the news'.
They want to be known for using my name.
It's a good thing.
They want to be known by my name, but that's what they do.
Smileing, he added that I'm a happy man and everything's right.
According to Reuters, Dare is preparing to launch a trial on Spain for Ronaldo's charges, which he called "the unacceptable reporting of unfortunate things in the life of the new life."
Wycliffe Christine Shartz said that Ronaldo would claim to be defeated according to the worst kind of survival of his personalities, perhaps one of the most serious threats of personal rights in recent years"
It's said that in June 2009, Pauls Hotel and Cassino came to a room in Las Vegas.
According to Clark County Cort in New Canada, after meeting at a Nativity class, Ronald and Mierga went back to the Palestinian Rome, where he unwittingly abused the way of sex with him.
Mae Yurga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo sat in front of his knees and told him that he was a "99% of the best man" but he was defeated by "a percent of evil".
In the documentary, Ronaldo has confirmed that he had established sexual relations, but this happened with mutual consent.
Mae Yurga also claims that she went to the police and was also taken to the hospital photographs, but later she decided to issue out of court because she was "being afraid of the traditional Corroy" and was also worried about "Awami Talle".
Mue Yurga says she wants to end this issue because she's in Terraca because of the verdict.
At the time of the continent, Ronaldo Manchester was going to join Real Medad in the summer, and in the summer, the Italian Club Juve has moved into the United States's agreement with 100 million euros.
BRAGET: ‘I'll be sorry for the loss of British supporters.’
The business secretary Greg Clark said that British would be "unfortunate" if he lost the world's position in the project after the budget.
He added that it's a 'Twoshnok' that Tweeta Yu has told BBC that if a bill comes out of the EU, he will soon stop his vocabulary in his factory near Berneston.
Mr. Clark said we need a del.
Japanese carpenter said that without Del Brogjet, jobs would be affected by the impact of the rapid delays in the form of Del.
The Berneston Plant - which makes Auris and Annisis cars of Tuvata, last year prepared about 150,000 cars in which 90 percent of the European Union was rebuilt.
In Berneston, Twenta's Managing Director Maron Cook said that this is my view if EU gets out at the end of the British March.
Other British activists Bashmol Honda, BM WBLO and JUGURLLLAN ROW have shown how to evacuate the elephants without agreement.
For example, BM DBLIO says that after the bregs, an oxford will stop the application in an oxford for a month.
Conservatives say that the more serious problems are related to the dangers of the Spelli Chinese in the form of Del Brogset without Del.
Tweeta's prodigious line runs on the basis of the 'breed Time Arder', under the British and EU's spulars from both of them to every 37 minutes.
If March 29 gets out of the elevator without British, it can be sweeping on the head, which can cause delay or lack of a party supply.
The company says that Tweeta will not be able to keep more money than a day's price in her dripping plane so the product will have to be closed.
Mr. Clark said that chequer plans for future relationships with EU's Ethysa's EU is prepared to avoid these unspecific developments.
We have to make a agreement that he told us to make a better dial that we want to deal successfully in present conditions, but take full advantage of this opportunity.
The testimony of other machines is that we will be able to keep our most successful Spanish Chinese completely.
Tovota was unable to tell how long the seeds will be stopped, but note that in a long period of time, the plane will be reduced and the last job will be affected.
Peter Sawiser, who has been working in Bournaston for 24 years and who has been in the plane, said that it's very worried about this: I'll never get back in my experience when these jobs are over.
One government translation said: "We have set a correct and reliable plan for our future with E Y."

In the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Russians thought they were able to use the device to record the conversation with the Termap and to remove the president from 25 volcanoes.

But we will look at it, and I like to be aware of Prese."
Some reporters will deny the claim: Sandras did not have a press brake in the White House from September 10,000.
The guest Chris Vallas asked why.
"Even if the lack of Brephongs was not due to the disapproval of the T reporters, I will not deny the fact that they understand it."
Then they suggested that the right relationship between Tomp and Price will grow.
They said, “The governor is more concerned about the demands of the former nobles than they are; we have seen their number.”
"Briffings will still be, but if Prise has a chance to ask sincere questions from the U.S. President, it's really better to talk to me.
We're trying to do this, and you've seen us do that in the past few weeks, and when you're talking to the United States President, we'll take it to the Prese Brogging.
When permission from the White House, with open sessions or regulations, the surgeon regularly asks questions in the press conference.
Only Price Conferences are very happy.
In New York this week, the president may have explained the reason for advancing from rules and sometimes advocates to the constitutional reporters.

The heat waves of the summer have increased the price of the British mining pabs, but the retirement has also increased the pressures of the reservoirs.
The statistics show that 2,7 percent of the selling of Pebbs and Bar Groups in July – but its price was reduced to 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, who collected these statistics CGA, said: "The more time in the World Cup was seen as a symposium of the past month, rather than the hope of smoke and England.
In June, 1.8 percent of the radius's business became worse in July.
If the reservoirs were compared to the selling of the restaurant, they have been successful as long as the reservoir's selling was lost.
The pibs on the skin were also affected, but not as much as the restaurant operators were affected.
It's like people want to go out.
The same manufactured pabs and bars paid up to 6.6 percent of this month, while the price of food was less than three percent.
“These results have continued with the attitude we have seen at the end of April.”
As far as Beroni Marquet is concerned, the effect of the weather and important social or sports is the worst.
Despite the loss of 4.8 percent a year's price, it is not surprising that the Restore group has been in trouble with the residue and that it will be painful for the continued prices.
There was no more time for long heat for the operators running on the food, and time will tell if the inevitable will provide a more reliable amount of time needed.
A total of 2.7 percent of Pebbs and Resistors, including the newlyweds, was in July, which reflects a lack of attitude toward the Bands.
