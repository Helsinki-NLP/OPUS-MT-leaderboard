Black box in your car?
While the road planners in the United States are struggling with the loss of wealth to improve the highway system, many people are looking at its solution in the black box, which fits your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks each mill run by motor driver and directs the information to the authorities, has become a symptom for rebuilding the old system of America's main streets, and has been a survival for the Kingdom Ministry Office.
Usually, such as Hawaii Niogen, it has suddenly become an issue of deep debates and living controversies.
You've been drived by Mill, and maybe you have details of the drive location - and then use this information to create the tax bill - the Liberian environmental groups to support the government to allow the use of these black boxes.
The cheese party is vegetable.
U.S. citizen freedom groups too are very concerned with various secretary issues.
While Congress could not agree whether to proceed or not, many are not waiting for the Kingdom.
They're searching for how they can go into a system that pays every mile set on the street in the next decade.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken the black box for test drives, some of which have to be monitoring.
It's really the necessary thing for our country.
"It's not the subject of choosing or not being selected by us," says Hazan Ikhrata, who is working directors of the South California Union, which is planning to start tracking every milled by motor-warners in 2025.
We're going to change our way of paying taxes.
It's technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's high trest field has almost been devastated, which is paid by taxes on gas pamps by American citizens.
Americans don't buy the gas anymore.
Now the car runs more than a gallons in a gallon gas.
Federal Tex had no increase in the past 20 years, which has 184 cent gallons.
Because of Gas's high value, the politicians also avoid increase in taxes.
Traveling expert Le Munich in Minnesota University says, "Grasing isn't really possible."
Their government has recently set up tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-me-function system.
They say, "This will work as the most reasonable option in time."
Wanx called it a millage-based user spikes.
It's not surprising that this idea seems to be interesting to citizens, since it can change the cycles of the car-track, which can help reduce the jam and reduce grenehaus gases.
California's planners are eager for this system while they are developing tactics to achieve the goal of the government's superstitious global Warming laws.
But the head of the home transport committee, Rip. Bill Suster (A.P.A.), also considers the most practical option of the Black Box.
Free trading in the Regen Foundation also stands on the side of the Mill payments by the driver.
"It's not just that it's going into the blind corner," said Adrian Mur of the Police in Regen.
People are paying more clearly for what they get.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. traveling secrets who had been favored by Congress in 2011 to continue in their report.
U.S. Senate accepted a test project of 90-Million dollars last year, including 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of the terrestrial systems, those who were representing people who had to go to daily work or go to the city, the leader of the Ghana ended the offer.
Nevertheless, many kingdoms and cities are going on this way themselves.
It's the most appealing Oregon, who lists 5,000 drivers in the largest use of the country.
These drivers will soon pay the millez slope instead of the Kingdom.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
The New York City is also moving forward in this direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on limited basis.
And I-95 buildings, including the 17 Kingdom survival department with eastern Sibird, are studying how they can perform this change.
This idea was not supported in all places.
In Navada, where this device was put on the cars of 50 volunteer car drivers a while ago, the drivers were too tired to think that the government could monitor each step.
Oududin Khan, directing the survival and function management in the Nwada Traveling Department, says, "Bug Brotherhood and other things of the same kind were a major problem."
It's not what people wanted.
With the progress of testing, the ACLU warned on your website: "It will be very easy to convert this device into a full tracking device."
There is no need for developing vast, unusable technique formatting, which must be expanded in order to keep every person's coming record.
Nevada is among the many kingdoms that are trying to achieve the potential industry, with which the kingdom could find out how many miles of the car are going every day, but it is not where and when it's going.
Khan said that if you can, people can feel more easily.
The discovery of this industry led some Kingdom Agencys to the little caliphonia start-up, called Tru Miles.
This form was not originally in business to help the drivers to rule.
It was trying to enter the market standing on the Oto Bema, where the drivers were to pay on their millez.
But the device which this is being testing seems good to highway Planners, because it does not use GPS and provides a lot of limited information, which is uploaded by modem at a certain interval.
"If you don't track people's speed and location, they'll be more willing to adopt this way."
There have been some serious mistakes in these early programs of the Kingdom.
There are too few costs and short intervention methods to do this.
In Oregon, planning drivers are using different-function options.
They may choose a device of GPS or non-GPS.
Or any device may be chosen from it, but may choose to set up an average evaluation based on the average mint of the Kingdom.
Other locations hope that this can be sold by giving more subsistence to the concerned citizens rather than to the low device.
In New York City, traveling officers are trying to develop a taxing device, which will also be able to pay the parking meter slope, "the payment according to your drive" will be paid, and will create a real speed of time from other drivers that can use motor- driver traffic.
The city is mentioned in the Nigerian document, "Motor-player will be attracted to it for the benefit of it."
However, some transport planners wonder that it may be that the discussion on paying according to Mill is a big surprise.
The Metropolitan transportation in San Francisco is said that the Congress Gas Tex can easily be solved with the problem of the Highway Trest Fund.
The hybrid or other car drivers can also be placed at a single-time or yearly slope that drives don't use too much gas so that they pay their proper share.
"What is the need for the Agency's statements and public affairs?" Randy Rentsheller said, "When Esperin can work, what is the need for the Aspecic surgery."
If we do so, millions of car drivers will worry about their secrets and many other things.

German M.P. Hans Cristian Strao Belle, visited Mr. Sno Den Seguer in Russia, where he has been given refuge to talk about the witness in Germany.
Sand took a letter presented by Mr. Snow Den in Berlin, near the media, saying: "But my efforts are positively positive, my government acknowledges unconsciousness as a group, and no defender is trying to criminal political talks with the charges of Gudgardi."
However, speaking the truth isn't a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snow Den said they believe that he can rule the American government to release charges against the international community.

The United States, along with the U.S. citizens, also the high officials have come to a supervisor of an unemployed system of public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when human situation is solved."
Frontier Airlines Carrie - On the Bage
The Frontier Airlines is planning to borrow $100 to store the resources on his plane board.
In Frontier Airlines, there is a plan to start a charging for $100, and it will set up $2 for coffee or du, while on Wednesday announced that the travelers can keep the whole bubble.
The new Carrie - On Silk overhead is for the bag, so small bags below the seat will be rebuilt.
Frontier said that $25 will be borrowed if it's paid in एडvines, $100 has to wait if the travelers wait to pay until they're on the gate.
Frontier Prime Minister Kate O 'Mali said that $100 is to get to care for the charges in the Adventure of 100-five passengers.
"We don't want him to charge," he said.
Airlines started charges for the first and second test bag in 2008.
The travelers who are trying to escape from the jungle are filling as much as they can in Carrie - On Bage, which is steel in the overhead Dubbe, means most of the lowest place in this dubbe.
There is a way to reduce access to the slope board.
O 'Mali said it's not really about getting a new charge money.
It's for most of the faithful clients about Frontier that looking for overhead bin has become a faster harder to find.
It doesn't have to give tickets in your website.
This means that the next person on line may have to pay 100 dollars for the same bag, while a traveler can get a bag on a French gate.
O 'Mali said that Frontier's website and check in the processes are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fisses before they get the ticket.
Frontier’s new carrier - on fifteen will not begin until summer, although a date has not been specified.
The travelers often express disquieting emotions about the baggage and others, but the air services like them.
They reason that the bag is spent to handle the bag, and those who want to serve should pay for it.
Wal Street's fifteen is looking as a signal that many airlines are doing enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years.
Most of the carrier - on bags are not hidden.
Spirit Airlines Inc. Carrie - On शुल्क started the first three years, and later by the companion of the disposer Allegiant Air.
With such a slope, another Air of Airline Hungary, who said Airline counselor J Sorenesen, and who tracks AD -On Fish.
He said that the carrier of the Spirit - On Skill produces $50 million in a year that was estimated in December 2011.
A former officer of Sorensen, Midwast Airlines, recently woke up in the spirit, and the passengers have had to face the carrier - On Unlimited bags on the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw was easy in my Airline career," he said.
I hoped to see the dentist and a fight gate out.
"The plane was full and he said that this lickty-split. "
Frontier too is following $2 of the Spirit's $ for coffee, tea, leave, or juice.
Frontier's good that the traveler who left, or juice can keep the whole box, and this free coffee will give it only one time.
It'll still take away the water.
U.S. Airways in 2008 tried to charge for drinking materials, but after seven months after the complaint of the passengers, they went back and followed any other major Airlines after they were there.
If Frontier's travelers don't buy directly from Airline, this step is your new attempt to manipulate clients on their own websites.
Airlines pays online traffic vendors for $10 to $25 for each sack.
That's why all Airlines have been encouraged to manage the passengers to buy them directly, rather than go through an online traffic agents.
Frontier, it's gone in this field.
In September, most of the flights began half the clients who bought an online traffic agent from these people.
On Wednesday, it lowered the Miles Award to 25 percent of Trip Mill.
So, a 1000 miles [1,000 m] from an online traffic agent will regulate the distance of the frrontier Trip 250 miles [250 m].
It also allows them to choose their seats in the Ugree for only accommodations on buying from the Frontier website.
In Frontier's Denver, there's a loyal base of clients in his home city, but its business is getting low and it's losing money.
The lack of 9 percent of the kingdom and its flying ability has been reduced by about 13 percent in the first stimulus, according to the adventure of the Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Ink.
The Republic Airline is trying to determine the loss of Frontier as part of the seller.
NSA has been accused of "internal error" instead of "internal error" for crashing the website
Secret National Security Agency told Friday that our website had been shut down for a few hours, not because of the heckers, as some people claimed online.
"NSA.gov didn't reach this night for a number of hours, which was due to an internal error during the pre-defined update."
This evening the problem will be solved.
This claim is not true that it was caused by the attack of the D.D.O.S., the distribution of service.
At evening, the online server trackers found that the website of NSA was closed for at least six hours, and the sites for some users are not yet accessed.
NSA's agent told the ABC News that the Agency's internal, sensitivity network was "never understood."
The speaker said no classified information is in danger.
At least a hectic group claims they're responsible for blocking the D.D.O.S. website by the attack.
The DDOS attack is designed to be transferred to more traffic on the website until the server is overloaded.
This is unrecognised cyber strategy and the purpose of attacks is not to identify the internal network of the target system.
The former most secret NGA, which has been named "No Agency", has become the subject of discussions and criticism between people in general since the events of the past months, since the visits of foreign and homely Japanese programs - the former UNA.S. awarded by Edward Snodden after being stolen from the Agency and secrets.
Because of this increasing debate about the Agency, such speculations were assumed after the night event, that the incident was the result of the target ciber operation.

As the plane's delivery as Bombardier's investigation, the intensity of commands.
Canada's airplane and train Macer Bombardy Inc reported 15 percent of rapid profits on Thursday, as at the third timber of his railway unit, and under pressure as less airline command and power.
Montrial-based Bombardier also did not offer an update to any air test data to his new branch for the new CSEries plane or to go to the plane next September.
It's just three times, the question arises whether the test steps are on the track.
The result was lower than the foreground and sent more than 8 percent to slide in the Sheer Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameroon Dorsen, analyst Share with the National Bank Finnishal, analysis stacked his rating to the "Region display" from गुरुवार to the "Region". Stock is above the next one or two thirds of the stacks.
"Kamjoar was expecting more than the airplane delivery, we are obviously disheartened by the majin display in the transport, "Dorcian said in a client note."
We'll get a new command for Bombardier CSeries as progressing to flying test program.
However, if no one's not declared in the new command coming months, the market will be advisable.
Bombardier expects the plane family now can cut it off at the end of the market of Boings and Airbas.
The first test was unveiled on the plane in March and was launched for the first time in September after the rest of the month.
Probably Kreta waits for the result of the flying test to accept the demands of the new jetliner industry and the potential costs of savings, but as far as CSER is between the middle of 177.
403 is available with the clients and the operators.
The main activist of Pierre Boomardin believed that he would complete his 300 sermon orders after the time he was brought to Bombardier before using genetics.
The authorities assured the researchers and Thursday that the program was running according to the index.
"Tracking plane was on the ground for a long time in a conference call," said Budine, adding it to a conference call, was determined during the land test and the software update plane's intervention.
Each builder creates a shell in a different way.
We've decided to make a first flight and a update period and said what we've done.
That will be all through the flying program.
The second part of the five test planes is expected to fly in the following weeks, the company said.
Still, scientists are doubting that clients can start a CSEries plane after their first flight in 12 months.

Mr. Bigg's secret information about the police test of Coken's Adi lawyer.
42 - year - old Batta, a prominent criminal, was informing Niel Scarboro
The authorities felt that people could find out about his secret psychological medication
He was sentenced to three years in prison for Leverpul Crown Court
To the top of the guard party, who told Mr. Bigg about the main police test, because he was afraid people will know about his secret drug, three years old.
After the 42-year-old deta compromised his cocaine's movement, the famous criminal Niel Scarboro provided sensitive sensitivity information about his new medicinal activity.
The official, who was named "Bash" and who was praised as "Top Briff", was arrested from his home in 2011 after the police surveillance in Scarboro, which he represented in the past Norkotik Trial.
The authorities saw 32-year-old Scarboro laying three bags of cocken in the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Luckshair, while he went out for his cocken with his colleagues.
After receiving the cocaine in Date's hair, his bucket, and his credit card, it was discovered that the "knowledge user" of Data A Gray's National Medicine.
During the eight months of January 2011, he tried to get illegal information about the arrest of two people from Scarboro and his colleagues.
It was then that all four conservatives were being under charge by the police as part of the main testing of Hiroin and Kochen teams working in the Burcesside, Burkesheid, and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 others who were sent to prison after they had been sentenced to over 200,000 pounds during the 1,5 million pound prices by the police, including Hiroin and Kocan, and more than 200,000 pounds.
And the 42-year-old ditta told the sinners, because he feared that the people would not know his liquid.
In the Blackbird, the situation was facing a trial in the case of Leverpul Crown in the case of Calvin Forms Soliciters, three weeks after the riot of the railways, after the riot of the Leverpul Crown court.
He accepted about keeping Cokeen in the previous hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer started when the police found that he was regularly contacted with the Deta from February 2011.
Two passengers followed the surgeon and saw it coming to the home of the ditta, and the Black Golf Glove had over 60 percent of the vicinity of the Valley's ben.
After the drugs were held, Scarboro dita was regularly contacted on the phone, which went out for Dinner at the Blackson Rovers Football Stateium, Ewood Park.
And when the lawyer came to his house, he found that there was a medication between them nine times.
The court was heard that when he found the survival of a grade’s surveillance medicine on the hairs, butue, and credit cards, he was found in the test.
Duta was later arrested, but he refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to Deer, because he was his client and said that his discussion was the subject of "virtual privileges."
During his arrest, Date attempted to remove a lot of credit cards, but they had been taken, and his hair had been modeled.
In the police interview he said he was driving his office along with his workplace, and his clients called at his home for the affairs of the rules.
After reporting what the spies knew about them, the court said that the Dhata drugs were called to the principal of the hospital, some of whom he had already presented the case.
Annie White from the Administration party said: "You should know the best about not breaking the law."
Mr. Dutta has been accused of using his position as a supervisor, too much to connect to his particular client.
We're not talking about the relationship of the normal drug dealer, but about a dealer who's giving his lawyer a niece.
There were some of their conversations without doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limit to the vacill-client relationship.
As he was able, he restricted the test of the police so that they could be able to continue their accidental activities.
Mr. Deta was not honoring his career, but insulting.
He took more than a certain client, especially from Scarboro, and he allowed his freedom of speech.
Date denied any wrong action and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, not I, and if I wanted to give information to Mr Scarboro, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.
But after hearing, the superintendent of the Lucashi Police, Helstad said: "The time Date started to obtain drugs from organized criminals, they changed themselves to the criminal.
They made a lot of compromises for their cocaine and became very weak to the next members of the organized crime groups, who used it to get important information related to the police test.
The rulers must have the highest standard of faithfulness, and the faith and confidence of men.
Mr. Deta has been deceived with this faith and has tried to survive his career.
The serious and organized crimes of the Lucasier were also checked by Mr. Duttan, which also found three cases of cocken and now blocking the way of justice, which demonstrates our resoluteness to bring the criminals to court.
The case should be a warning to the criminals that no one is far away from the law.
We'll find you and present you to the court.
Scarboro was sentenced to 14 years after he was found guilty of conspiring to Hiroin, Kochen, and Vang.
For 153 years, a total of 50 other members of the group were sent to prison for drug crimes.
Date on his website asked and answers sessions about himself, where he said that he would be a lawyer for the death sentence client in the United States, to be their deanor guests and insensitive to their work.

The parents of Georgia's teenage parents believe their son was killed.
A young man in Georgia whose dead body was found wrapped in his high school gym, which says that his son was killed, the Teacher of the family said that he was killed.
Valdosta, G. Kandrik Johnson, was found on January 11, in the middle of his high school gym, in the middle of the Blackches.
The researchers of London County Sheriff concluded that Johnson had died in a 'inadequate accident', but the family of the 17-year-old boy rejected it.
“They believe that their son has been murdered”, the governor of the businessman, who presents Jackelin Johnson, said to the Fox News Dot Coom.
They don't even trust in death in the way Sheriff told them.
Cramp said, "They believe that it's from physical laws and intelligence."
They think it's an excuse for a responsible person or people for the death of his son.
He said, "They sent his son with a book-back school, and he returned in a buddy bag."
U.S. Prime Minister Michael Correy told the गुरु that he was investigating an incredible test on Johnson's death, seeing that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he killed for some crime?
Murray said this in a journalist conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, and they will bring us wherever they go.
My purpose is to bring the truth in front.
He said: "I think there's an environmental test.
Moore said to the reporter that the death of Johnson has resulted in "the state of survival."
According to the Moore, like a second corpse test, there has been a different reason for death."
They said, "There is a great question which should be answered, or whether he should be of those who are true to their word."
Moore also said that if he finds enough evidence to seek a criminal or to check citizen rights in connection with Johnson's death, he will say to FBI to do it.
While contacting the Thursday was not immediately available for commenting from Londonez County Sheriff's office in London County.
On Wednesday, the judge of South Georgia ordered the prosecutors to launch all the oversight videos that have been reviewed by testators.
The boy's parents hope they'll get some signals from the video footage about how he died.
CDC issued a child's algebraic elegance-direction for students.
On Wednesday, the disease control and stopment center launched the direction to control children's food algebra in school.
The first time the U.S. government has issued such directions, since the number of students who are studying are increasing infected with food allergies.
Now in U.S., one of every 20 children has food allergies.
CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, 18 percent of the children's concerns of food algery have been increased.
In this direction, teachers and employees are given information about how the food allergies should be indicated about children's food algebra, and how it should be handled in case of an algebraic reaction.
The students are also advised to keep the stadium of the Epiphany in order to cope with the deathal force (affilexis), which is the auto-ingent of the epiphane Brand, which is the most commonly used.
The Kingdom Constitution has recently updated the rules so that the students can easily keep the stacks of Epiphany in a large amount.
The report includes the list of common symbols that children interviewed by Algeric Response.
The children can say, "It looks like something's stinging in my tongue," "it looks like I have a hair on my tongue," or "I'm sneaking in my tongue."
Parents of an intersection key can choose their children's 'lling undefined '
German European Union has become the first country to accept the third ring for children born with superstition.
Now the newborn children will not be assigned to man or woman in the genetic way.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare lyns for such children, this law allows them to declare the lynch on the birth of the child's certificate 'undefined" or "unspecified".
The purpose of the new law is to reduce pressure on parents who can take immediate decisions related to sexual-directional techniques for new children, and to fight prejudice against Internet children.
According to B.B.C., an intercessor man said years later, "I'm not a man, not a woman."
I'm gonna be a jewelry made by doctors.
According to the estimate of the year 2000 children, there is a child who has no child or daughter.
They are intercessex, part of the group of about 60 cases, which comes under test of sexual developments, this is a common word that is used for inequality, genetics, or naturally developing gender.
Maybe Valice's simulation is integrated.
But most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information to specify when the lyn-default is not possible, and to make sure that the child's psychology and physical development are not yet understood.
In New York City, mentalist Dr. Jack Dresser, who is expert in the affairs of gender, said that Germany's new law is "believed as something better."
Intercessex children create moral insensitivity.
They said, "There are people who are in a state of ill health, but most of them do not.
You can only specify the lyrics without diagnostics, and then see how the identity grows.
Science is not very reasonable to know how a child develops a gender.
No one can just answer why this happens.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are homosexual.
Intercessex has been described as different in terms of transsexuals or transactions in 2011, since their status is not related to gender but is linked to its biological design, which is not clearly neither male nor female but either or both are uncommonly defined.
These attributes can show themselves to secondary sexual analysis, such as the weight of the meatpages, the distribution of the hairs, the stomach and the length; the primary sexual ambition such as the production and generation; or the quality of quality formats, and the Hormone.
This report also gives lions of tyrannical prejudice, violence, and prejudice against slaves in the region of the Internet and Transgener people.
Now there are special camps for non-explained boys.
Australia and Nepal have already been authorized to mark older people on their official documents, men, women, or "thirty rings".
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie Me-Welby became the first "invisible" legal apologies in the world after the world's first "exclusive" man.
According to the intercessor, the German passport will also be the third specification for individuals without M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, there are still conflicting points related to gender in France.
In 2011, these hardly signed the "Long Principles" request to return from the French law-womans from this Catholic country to the university's books.
The U.S. website has also opposed the German law, saying, "When the world is going to be in a state where the ring is the choice of itself, but not the sex activist, we are moving to two and columns in the opposite direction."
The mother of a new child in Maryland also told Baby Joan that she would like to see the lyrics specified at the time of birth.
They said about child rearing on the website, "The child is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is."
Children need firmness and determination.
Historically, both male and female children born with genes were called Hermafroids, who were in the name of the beautiful Greek god who was bilingual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world viewed lyn as a slope that could be removed and could be written again.
But now many people are trying to challenge the morality of Silence, they understand that gender is complex, and sometimes even doctors who don't know how the children will feel about their ring specification when they grow up.
Dresser says, "In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "Monoceapolational".
When these children were born, you didn't call the psychologists, you called the slick-chinic.
The current principle on the treatment of the illiteracy children was presented by John Hapkins University of Dr. Mani, who considered the lynching to be sympathetic.
He created the word "Ling Identity" and reasoned how social and environmental signals - parents raise the child - initiate the gene and Hormones to identify him as a male or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, the doctrines of Joan/Joan were debated.
He advised his parents to keep the child in full tiger and get his eggs out of the ladder and like the red-white girl.
Dresser said, "Mary presented the case as a successful case, but he didn't.
At 15 years of age, the child changed himself as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he suicided.
Dresser said there are still some doctors "following that image."
But in the late 1990 ’ s, with internet's investigation, the people with the lyn-chikitsa began to come forward "do not be pleased with the change".
That was the case with 36-year-old writer Jim Brus, who was born with X.Y. man's quality, but his geneal was obscured.
The doctors didn't understand clearly that his ring was small, or his half-sheph was too big, but they were sure he could never live as a man.
So it was only a few days after his birth in 1976 that Brus were removed by the external components and Andkosh Shali-Chikitsa and was raised as a girl.
He was given the woman Hormon at the age of 12.
He said to ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was hard to question.
At 18 years of age, he was going to be a vizinoplastti.
But, in a sense, he demanded medical archives.
This made him aware of the scary truth.
When I was born, I was sentenced to prison, and no one told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, who prevented his body from making a thorough testosteron, so his genetics could not be developed properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man, he took the testosteron and removed his stomach.
He's smuggled because of smiling.
Today, he explains to people about Internet people in the interface project name.
However, the advocates of California-based advocates for Informed Chauese, the authorities of the United States, expressed concern that the German law "speech and call" is called "sacred"."
"Many activists think that the German law will move parents to make a quick decision and to specify the child "specific"."
We're afraid it'll encourage the intervention.
We think it's better to specify a man or a woman ring rather than wait.
But we don't know how the law will carry its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law because "it allows the older to be identified in the third gender."
He said, "The adults should be able to make their own decision about verbal gender."
The German law is related to it at the time of birth.
It's not the war that will be fought by the newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can make decisions related to their body.
But Pittsburgh's Story Radiologist Dr. Arlin Baratz, whose daughter has a sex development disorder, and who help hundreds of other people in the support team, said that the German law will give both parents and children “power”.
Barastzi's daughter was born with Catty men, but she was a full Androgen insensitive sensitivity name D.S.D..
Since his Androgen was wrong in the village, women were developing in Catta.
He's still in his body, but there's no pregnancy or demographic.
Now 29-year-old Cat is married and is resident in the Bal Municipal Department in Pencilvnia University.
Although she's a monster, she expects to be a mother through a goat or a Gestol Sergeocy.
Baratz said, "This law gives parents the right to not decide themselves quickly."
It gives them the correct understanding and time by a few tests before, 'man' or 'man'.
In this way, you're fine - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely baby and enjoy her.
We don't need to have to make any quick treatment that can't be done back.
They said: "He brings children to be judged, and delivers them from the abominable enemy to parents, because they do not believe that they are doing good."
Finally, the child will determine what it's more easy with the gender -- and it'll be very good.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

Report: Think of the Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to New York Times, the closest counselors of the President Barak Obama secretly thought about Hillary Clinton at the place of the president of the national president, Kelai Biden, to the ticket 2012.
The most outstanding threat in the secretabadtan is that Mark Halparine and John Heleman, a major 2012 campaign team, "Wall Down: Change Game 2012."
Times received a copy of the Agami book and told the top advisers of the president's "Watch group-stars and delay postings" to see how the Obama could help reassess the choice.
According to Times National Police Jonathon Martin, the book has complete information on the campaign of main rights, and the main bill of the White House, for the name of the West Haus, to see how the Sectarian Clintton of Eastern State has effect on Police’s change on Pool.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the basic structure of the Chicago campaign and within the Oval Office.
Only about half of the dolls of the President - with the East Obama campaign chief Jim Massina, and the former White House counselors, David Oxloud and David Polophe.
"Dubble Dunn" claims that Kay tried to change Biden, despite their personal agreements, when his information was finally informed that the client's ticket will not improve the situation of Obama.
In a testimony with Martin, Die has confirmed that the president was actually thinking about the place of Clinton with Biden.
"I looked at the whole view, and one of them said, "It was."
For you remember that the president of that time was in danger, and we were in such a state, saying, 'Holy Christ, what shall we do?'
When he told the research, Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper again how important it would be to find out how much benefit it would be to the poll after the CN.
"As a campaign paso don't spend a lot of time on the mainstream groups while they're thinking seriously," said Martin on S360.
It's fuzzy, Halaki, what Obama knew is looking for their team changes.
Martin told Sion that they had asked the boss if they knew about the possible change?
When he said that he didn't know the president about the possible change", East Chiff of Staff acknowledged that it was "perhaps" that Obama knew.
"Dubble Dunn" is certain: will not answer if the political checks were reached to the desk of Obama? Martin said and said.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought he didn't know about Obama Biden Dumping tickets.
"Perhaps," said Martin.
Does glo-in-draw Ice Cream like?
A British analyst has used the glo-in-dock Ice Cream - Jeliffish, the first of the world.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the sea animals to develop the finest surveillance.
After reading a search letter on Geliefish, he came to the idea, and the skeptic scientists of China used the chemical light to reflete the protein.
Ice Cream, responding to the feeder's tongue, will increase the pending level of the protein and the Ice Cream will shine.
Chris says that Icecream is a spectacular reaction from the heat of the mouth, or the winning will be more likely.
"It's untrustable, but I'm going to get some 2 gamma material from the beginning."
The protein that we're using in icecream will respond with Newtarle PEAH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is hot, the protein will increase the PAH level and the icecream will shine.
We've been investigating for a few months and it's quite right to share in Helowin because it's a wonderful light effect.
It may be the most important ice cream that has been made because the zeliphish light is four times more than gold.
So the cost of each skup comes to me about 140 pounds [140 kg].
Although it's sweet, it's very good.
Apne is known for an unusual taste, including agricultural company, beer, pineer, meat and gold.
But his next design is going to be more important.
He said, "I really wanted to develop an invisible Ice Cream."
It's naturally impossible because of the ice cream that makes up the ice cycle, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice Cream is the use of a geography of a geography that has been discovered by Chinese scientists

George Carevon: Euro Witton gave the Scotts option
Another day, another story of freedom
This time we are warned that free Scottland will need to be part of a free travel zone in Europe as the condition of the EUU's subscription of EU.
On Burwick, the passport control and the walls of Hedrian signals the borders of the monkeys.
True, Stratclide Paper described the possible financial benefits of freedom in Europe with the rest of Europe, although it was not described in a predictive way - Headlines.
No one has described that most members spend their own time changing their natural rules to their own needs.
Since Scotland is not a slope area, Brassels will be always free for non-animated Brussels instead of really what they want from Scotland.
So, then, A-Qaani.
And the thing that's so long gone, is enough. First, I heard the news about freedom means passport control.
Still, this thrilling story was lost to reproduce.
Why should we expect Europe to be sold from a free Scottland?
Why should London's yok be sold for Brussels, especially now?
Here is a real European news: The great, war-woman plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With Euro's trouble, the project is officially dead in Europe.
In the whole EU, the dedicated groups are getting strong enough to resist or shut down the EU as the same currency.
Even in Germany, Eurostepel Alternetev, which has been established for this year - suddenly, some 50 million votes in the United Nations elections of Sember, and thus the Free Democratics (our Libb Dams) were effectively evicted from Bundasteg.
The plan to build the U.S. Europe is always opposed.
However, the current economic crisis proved to be major changes.
With the harsh rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, the survival of national economy has caused many to think that the project has gone far away from Europe.
Euro's disaster wasn't the most important part of the national governments - it was only true about Greece.
In fact, Euro system has set its members up to the currency exchange rate of German exporters - something that the German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of the homely curiosity, South Europe finds himself in an internal damaged state of production than Germany.
The only solution is to minimize the Vatican and public activity - which is encouraged by Berlin.
The current budget and curiosity sufferers from deep European production patients.
For freeing the French and German energy factors on the use of users - resulting in the "would" energy policy, the European economy pays four times for electricity and gas.
This is the cost we've already seen in Graengamouth.
Even all the funds in the world can't save the European Petrokemills industry from being affected by the US shell gas.
As a result, the spirit of rebelism is being provoked among people, especially in France, the principal commendation of the EU.
Following the U.S. politicians of France, E.U. and Paris saw the way to control Germany, giving them a billing in the world.
But Berlin now does not need Paris as a passport for political validity, and this has applied his own economic policy on Europe, which is draining the economic system of France.
The result: Marine Lee Penh, the Southeast Asian National Front, has won the regime in the recent subcontinent.
This is now the most popular team in France with 24 percent of votes - it's a time warning for British Leber that they can't believe that it will benefit both left, for right.
What is Le Pen French Gorries doing with your new reputation in the workshop?
This group wants to use the e.U. opposing, the best currency bat in the European encyclopedia, the next year.
If, as much as possible, the e.U. opposition teams display a good display in these choices can be affected by the European economy the first time.
My view is: The EU will soon end the EU and the most influential of the opposing eruptions in Europe.
Euro won't end completely, but it's going to be back in a way like "(Lord) Europe of the nations" which will support the general de Gaul.
Germany and some of its features can keep the econo, but France and South Europe will rewind their curiosity.
I hope U.S. will keep myself away from this project.
However, the growing interest in Inspiration in Pakistan indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all this?
We can choose to be the area of Little England (actually).
Or we can protect our own financial interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better functions in the European system, if we keep our own talents.
It will be easier to work together with other people who think similarly in Europe in non-national nations.
Otherwise we should consider keeping our financial freedom on the way to Norway.
In Scotland - the government - the most successful political campaign in Europe, which was astounded in the year 2011 by the Chancellor Elisteer Darling (or actaciously) and then astounded by Torie-Lib Dem Baghdad.
It would be unfortunate for Scotland at this time, because it will accept the rules of the Metropolis and Brussels in that situation.
Youths before time: Faster
The discoveries indicate that African-American and Hipspenic girls have acquired sex in less age than their age.
Physical change does not mean that sex is near
There is no evidence that Hormon or any other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe that drowsiness can be a cause of infection in less life
The case of sex before time is not so effective in boys
The former chatter of CNN is special journalists in the health and family issues of the Pate Ethriz children.
Should the mother be concerned if her daughter starts to develop a stomach and the child’s hair in the age of 7 or 8?
This week, in the United States's anniversary of the American Child Medical Association of Academy, Bal Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that the initial physical change is common in American girls, which represents a new movement.
"I spend a lot of time to convince the provincials - that normally it does not refer to a fast progress in the direction of the whole sex."
Evidence of development, such as the slope of steels, the hairs of the geneon and the hair of the skin and the physical gnats are already seen in time.
But in the past four decades, the age of Rajjo (printh Month) has been very simple.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the steel starts to grow, the first is at least two or three years in the exhibition." Capelovitz says, "In the girls, the time-for-time sex: the best guide is to deal with this common problem."
It's the best test time of youth development.
There is a debate about what sex starts, but when it grows with steel development before 8 years of age, it is called "bold-old".
In most cases this process will slow down or stop – the hair doctors can be monitoring.
In a faster progress, an investigator may need to check the potential potential problems such as tumors or systems.
Time-previous month-to-dos and other results are treatments to delay: time-prediction period-prediction, which may cause intensity increases and increases as old age.
Drugs or hormone treatment depends on the age of a child, development rate, increase rate, and emotional growth.
It's also important for medication.
Capelowitz is well aware of drugs, but he acknowledges, "pressing the youth can add practical points, and girls may feel separated from their friends."
The other big issue can be considered: The president doesn't just want their little age daughter to have possibilities.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will keep clean."
A woman, whose daughter had started math religion at 10 years of age, remembers, "It was smart.'
Although there were signs of this thing and we had also talked about the month-religious, it was not emotionally ready.
She was afraid of her school and worried that she had started the first month religion in her friends.
There are a lot of popular principles about the reasons for the survival.
Nevertheless, there is no constant evidence that the hormone in milk or other foods can be blamed for sexual messages in the environment or in the media.
The boys are getting the pre-time sex like girls.
Capelowitz decides that the most important reason for survival is the anger.
He helped to conduct a study on 6 to 9 years of age girls in 2001, which unite the body’s development with the time of sex.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute.
In this country, African-American and Hippenic girls are forced to get sex before their young girls.
There's a lot of explanations about this.
On the global level, the picture of time-fore sex, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seems to be affected by all things.
Other puzzles: Even though boys are getting young faces and childhood hairs short, the entire sexual behavior of the girls is not as clear as they are.
Other doctors who attended the AAP conference support the complexity of the subject.
Even the hairs of the hairs and the hairs of the child and the kids have become common among the children.
“We need to be careful about how we recognize the real start of the holiday, ” says Dr. Laurens Silverman, in the Gorgeb Childress Hospital in New Zealand.
Essentials should not hesitate to take the lead in their child’s medicine to consider how to talk to their children.
Caplowitz suggested, "This may mean talking before expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will normally answer.
Women who grow up from time need to be assured that it's already going up, but it's part of normal life.
The breeze was ranked at 3.1 degrees Fahrenheit [3.1 degrees Celsius] in temperature.
On Wednesday night, the rain and the cold wind caused people to feel cold.
And when the mighty man was clothed with sackcloth, they went out into the markets, and to their dwellings.
And when the first rain was cold, people have also taken the jaws.
Even in the morning, people came to see the sun.

For the seat width, the jet is on the big orders of the builders.
A riot for the two-third of this month has become a struggle between the width of the airports for long distances for the flights of the air-clusters.
The debate focuses on the width of the Iconomy class in the long flights, not always given by the Arlines, but that of the administrative position Letet Jets Aerbes and Boining company claims to be the key.
Aarons this week is expected to have a large seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) of the Iconomy Cabin, but it should be determined by its main-religious Boing.
Protests come between the airplane buildings after the event of 17-21 when the Arcroft's largest engine in the long distance of the Arcroft was intensified.
How has the previous part of the plane been created - especially if the seating is 9 or 10 equals to more capacitys, being designed by Mini Zambo Zeits?
Boing says it's made "777 X" which will put 406 people in 17 inches [17 cm] and 10 people in an arg.
Airbos says it's going to take 350 people in 18 inches [18 cm] in the place.
The airplane often harbors trade on technological matters through advertisements in the business press.
Now, Airbes with 777 X is expecting more than 100 orards in the Dubai Arsro, which then appeals to the public.
Recently it is seen that there is something going on in the beginning of the war that shows Fincero this together in a railway together?
Airbs seller chief John Lehi said, "Boying Regional Turbo is also taking long flights in the concrete."
As a change, people are getting better, but the way the plane is not changed.
According to the Statistics of the U.S. health department in the 1970 ’ s, Boing 747 J.N.N., I am an average of 40 - 49 - year - old Americans, which increased me to 10 percent.
According to American health synthesis, the average man of the 21st century is 39.7 inches [39.7 cm].
Airbos says it's been ticked by a seat in 1950 when the new name was the average coverage of the "Jet Set".
Airbes says that they have set up the Research Commission that suggests an additional 53-five-five-five slumber in the width of the seat.
Boing argued on the figures of Airbose's seat measures, and it said that it does not depend on the decisions of the builders, how the Airlines can make balance between the kitchen and the vaccines.
It also says, the revision shows the experience of more than a seat width of cabin.
Boing Cabin Expert said that "It actually tells Airlines what they really need to do to succeed."
"They don't want to tell us what they benefit."
They're better aware of their business than anyone else.
It's about the private room for Flyers, but for the officials it's a quick point that it can affect I.
The business of at least 700 billion dollars after this debate is enough in the decades leading up to the scale of the U.S. and the European Export of the airport.
Reiter's report on the first time in July, what seat loop is actually a struggle between new jet planes.
Airbos and Boing claimed that 20 percent of their new seats have been functioning in the engine design, equal to 365-sitt Boyng 777-300 array.
The claim of Boing’s display depends on 10 to 777 x square roots with 77 degrees Fahrenheit [9 ° C].
It's 10 to be used with profit in the unit's price.
Kevin Kenniston, Europe's Airbish troops, says Head, "It's the plane of Boing's plane to control more seats, with our products."
On the other hand, the scientists say that the entire 10-cent-side line is suggesting for the current 777 S that many passengers are on the side of the Denser Layout, as well as with the steel.
KBin Inner Experimental Experimental Experienced My Carby, Builder, and the Ranwei girl Network said it would be very good for the seats of 18 inches [18 cm], but the fact is that this business post of Airbos is composed by the threat of 777"
The AirBus and Boeing Seats are not available but are providing a list of providers to choose for airlines.
The jet vendor of the world may also be careful to check these layouts investigators.
With more relaxing, all buildings are also giving high density layouts for the low-smooth air services and regional trips.
It's 10 equals A350 but say it's not sold.
But recently, as long as Airbes stressed some of its jet planes to need more cabins.
It's not possible to blow a new venture on the standard without support of modern jet planes without supporting another Creator, but it can distort the waves of the 777 X vendor.
New anti-Nicotin can end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotin vixin, which can end the meeting with smoking.
Waxin's only food was able to protect the nectar of Nikotin for the whole life.
Ronald Christal, professor of the World Medical College in New York, needed further testing before being launched.
Professor Cornel said: "We hope that this kind of victory can help millions of smokers at the end of the day, who have tried to stop smoking, using all the methods in the market today, but they found that Nikotin’s blood is more powerful than these current methods."
The new vixin has a harmless virus, which has been prepared to deliver genetic information from the purpose of making anti-Nicotine antibodies.
This virus, selectively processes the cells, which begin to make a permanent rain for antibodies after that.
Antibodies search for any nicotine in blood, and prevents the need for nicotine inside the smoker before they come into the brain before they are infected.
In test, Vaxine was given the chicken who later received Nikotin, they continued to perform their normal activities.
Researchers say, but the chicken that had not been given the vixin was "good", it was a sign that Nikotin had reached his brain.
The use was described in the cyclone transitional Medicine magazine.
The former Tambaku Vaxin failed because they had an antibodies.
It had to pay a regular interval to keep the standard of antibodies, but it proved to be smart and unfortunate.
But the value of the new vixin is expected to be great, because it will make the cell a factory for antibodies.
Professor Christol said that if the future human vixine could be completely protected, it could be given to children before the desire to smoke, so that they could be saved from the vices of Nicotan.
But it is probably used to avoid smoking by people who smoke.
He said, "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will find no happiness in smoking because of the vices of Nikotin, which can help them recover their habits."
British scientists pointed to the result shocking, but warned of the need to be searched more.

The former UNW worker who refused to accept the policies of the seaports on JA triPody, his political leaders, Addy Obide, who had hidden selfishness in the three countries under the government.
On Friday to examine the free aggression (ICAC) against corruption, did Mr. Obide break the documentation of the policies of several Kingdom ministers?
Lin Ashpolle, before the testimony given by the former Chief of Staff, did Mr. Tripodi Obeid know the selfish motives of the charge?
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government pressured to start public taxes for the boards.
The guards were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, Obadid's entry for the boards, which was purchased for $2.5 million, renewed by without a dock.
Mr. Tripodi, who was a prison minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was at the beginning of public tender.

On 457 VJ, the foreign workers can go through the test of "privation"
The government is thinking about a "creation" test for foreign workers on 457 VJ, since it is purposed to expand a harsh action.
If it is accepted, this test will be applied through a standard designed to prevent family and friends from being brought up in or expandedly in Australia.
Today a government discussion was issued, insulting the government's words about foreign workers, former Leber Lesin McKu said that this could disrupt the neighboring countries of Australia today.
They said to the United States Institute today, "The foreigners are coming to the end of the queue" and the strong statement about the Australians before work" is very disgusting at a time, while Unions have requested a safe labor market."
Historically, it meant that white workers should be given protection - and if some people in the area have seen the evidence of the historical testimony, I will not be surprised.
The discussion posts a series of 12 options, which were previously thought by the former advocate Cris Bowen.
Protest Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka, where he met the authorities about those who were retired, has been active in five continents, while the rest of the controversy.
If "authority" is accepted, the testing of Vija Administratives can be seen as true in situations that are known as the owner of a person who is not known, or the person who is a competitive, or a personal friend.
The businesses may need to count 457 advocates, because the first businessmen who wanted to provide the workers in lesser numbers held hundreds of people at work.
During this time, 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugees died from heart attack after they arrived in a refugee ship at Christmas Island.
The nine-year-old son of the man came to Australia with him, and aged brother, after his father's death, laid a covering on his shoulder, who was on the same pool.

The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the Scotland project.
HS2 directs high speed services in the northwest part of Scotland and England, which will soon start with the first step in 2026.
The Traveling Prime Minister Barnos Cremer told the project "Britten will be one."
In Scotland's transport minister Kith Brown said they're very "successful" by working with the British government on this project.
The first step includes a new high rail line between London and West Midlands.
When the second step is over, lines will reach Manchester and Lids.
In June, the government regulated the cost of building a high speed link between London and North England by 72.7 Billion.
The British government, which was talking to Scotland transport, directed HS2 Limid to consider the possible potential for the North England and the railways of Scotland.
It includes the possibility of going up three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
According to Bernice Cremer: "Our goal is to the HS2 real national network that will bring Yuke and its cities close."
We're going forward with HS2, because it's much more profits.
Without it, we will face problems related to our Red Network's ability.
But this is also about the connection between 18 cities of Britain and Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be well connected with HS2.
According to Scotish Secretary Elester Carmel: "The announcement of today is well aware of Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Kith Brown appealed to the HS2 network of Scotland's "Spot" return from Mr. Carmel.
Mr. Brown said: "The chance to have a big financial profit from high speed railways, but this will also increase the financial burden on Scottland in all the country's high speed railways.
So we are enthusiastic about working in the British government's share, so we can check the options to create the high speed rail in Scotland, to make profit for all, and to complete the Glasgow-Edinburg line, which is already planning.
I'm ready to analyze the test report with the British authorities and make a decision together on the next action.
Airplanes will now be effective in Australia
It must continue to close your tablets and smart phones when the airports are smuggled into the commuters in the US.
US Union plane Administration has opened the option to change its processes, so that travelers will be able to read e-books, view videos, or play games on their devices, while they remain in "Wayon" mode.
The travelers can still do this during many flights, but many people don't seem to be unable to reach their e-book in order to reach their e-book.
Australian Air Force companies are considering the decision, which means the US Air Force Service companies will have to work much to accomplish this need, but they have signaled that they have no time to change their processes.
The citizen plane security authorities also said she was thinking about the announcement, but he emphasized that even in the important steps of airplanes in Australia, the power of electricity has still been affected.
"At the current CSA, there is no specific vanilla in the plane that controls the equipment of electrical devices," said the author, "this issue comes under Violence, which ensures the air-service operation companies that the security system has always been established, and the passengers have to follow the directions provided by the members of the driver team."
Virgin, who is already talking to CASA about extending the use of his-floight Y-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he asked to act on the direction of the Virginia.
"We will welcome a review by CASA on the use of electric devices, because we really feel that this will provide a better experience for the clients, because we (Warles in-flyt entertainment) now have our planes.
Quantas said it would now follow the current rules.
He said, "It is not possible to use electric devices during the airplane and the airplane, and we have no plans to change it immediately."
The FAA decision applies to the American Alerlines.
Similarly, we are always interested in diverse developments that can benefit travelers, and we will certainly consider the decisions of FAA and the reasons behind them.
The effect of this decision, each US air service company will be different and depends on the age of their plane.
Voyan Service companies will need to verify that they can endure radioactivity from their plane mobile devices, as well as research on their rules books, training materials, Carrie-on-Bugge programs and travelers.
FAA said, "When the airlines allow the airlines to hold all the highways, the light weight device such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones."
In the low-visible case, the driver will direct the drivers to stop their devices while the plane is down.
The group also suggests heavy devices to be safe under the seat or put in the upper bubbles during the airplane and the airplane.

A 325 million dollars saving package for Tajy’s health
The U.S. government emphasized that there are also severe restrictions for the poor health system of Tasmania with 325 million dollars that will ensure that the government could not destroy the government.
The Union Health Minister Tania Plibersek announced that the old population of the country, the population of the island, the high rate of green diseases, and the system's borders are being “compulsed” to solve the present crisis.
The decision to be executed during the four years was made after the government's consultation with the Free Sand Andro Wilke, Tasmania.
Sussie Plibersec today said, "Salvation has taken the survival rescue package, which we believe it will solve the special challenges faced by the Kingdom."
The 325 million dollars' package includes 31 million dollars's alternative operation plan.
And 2600 additional operations will help solve the past collective issues.
In Hobart and Lonests, it also includes better care, better care after leaving the hospital, the training of medical experts, mental health services, and personal electronic health archive systems in local hospitals.
"These are the best ways to improve the health system of Tasmania by previous doctors."
The Minister emphasized that Tasmanian government will face severe reporting and responsible government.
The Kingdom needs to keep the current-productive level in order to obtain the National Political Riches, and every month reporting where additional demands are being done.
The three members will be organized to make sure that they are provided with a powerful and skillful service through the Kingdom.
Mr. Wilki said that the 325 million dollars would not be much more, "Unless the public health system of Tasmania has been corrected for more survival levels."
Yet they praised the government to respond to their request for help immediately, which they brought to the chief of the first time at the beginning of the month.
Mr. Wilki said, "I hope that the organizational help package will be very helpful in the direction of the Kingdom Rey Public Health System.
According to the Kingdom government, these additional alternative processes will mainly restore the recent cuts.
But the United Nations Health professor Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement is "band-ed solution."
He said to the ABC TV, "We're here because the Laber State has taken 430 million dollars in his health system.
You can't accept the good news as a good news day to take about half a billion dollars by the Kingdom government and pay 300 million dollars by the National Conference.
Mr. Dutton requested that Sussie Plibercek should be guaranteed that no one of the safe package will be paid on extra jobs.

Arosh on the torture stake of the boom explosion in Balley
In 2002, 202 people who were killed in the bomb bombs were shouting at the execution of the bomb explosion to the victim.
Pekk, who had fled from the most demanded people of Southeast Asia for about 10 years, was announced for his role in creating the bomb explosion device used in the explosion.
It can be released in 15 years after the parool is given.
The 45-year-old age was attacked in two nightclub in Kuta's famous passengers, where 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many were wounded.
He was also found guilty of many other accusations associated with terrorism, including the predetermined bomb explosion in the church in Indonesia in the eastern ceremony in 2000.
The organizers had asked for a life sentence, even though they could even ask that the boss who built the boom would be the death of the man who was called "a murderer" as the boom builder.
The decision renewed the sad memories of the woman in Perth who had lost her 39-year-old daughter in the disaster attacked by Palestine and her colleagues a year ago.
They stopped their homes and said that the Palestine should be executed.
I really feel he should be punished like other terrorists.
Sussie Cortin said to the AAP, "He should be raised in front of the firering team."
I have to live without my grandson and my daughters every day.
The club was lost after the explosion of the bomb was loaded outside the whole club on October 12, 2002.

As a result of this bomb explosion, they went to the comma one month and died three times as they stayed on the lifesaving tools.
Mr. Hughes says that the Pek was to be the same sort of punishment that Jimmah was found to be three other members of the terrorist army - Amorogi, Mahalalas, and Imam - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be executed before someone else.
Look, there's no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and killing millions, it is not enough for 20 years to be punished.
Pank, the last person to get out of the Balli bomb explosion.
He was spared for about a decade, but eventually in January 2011, he was arrested in Abtababad, Pakistan, where U.S. Army of the U.S. Army was killed by the former Alkaida Bin Laden after four months.
The FBI Agent reported that Bill was in Palestinian to meet Laden in trying to reestablish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Alkaida.
Sussie Cortin says, "He didn't surrender."
Even today, he's not really hurting so many people.
This decision came before the 10th year of attack, which will be marked by events in Balai and Australia.
Sussie Cortin said, "This year will be very tears."
The Pentax can still appeal against his punishment.
F.A.: The airplane can now use gadgets in airplane (but cannot call the cell phone)
The airline passengers will be able to use their electronic device to see, see, and hear music - but can't talk to your cellphone - that's under the U.S. U.A. volcanic administration.
But the passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
In a news administration of the FAA, Michal Hurtta said how fast these changes are being processed, it would be separated in each airline.
The Airlines will indicate how their plane, new-directions, and how the rules are uploaded to the training books and devices of the members of the driver's drive-directories to show.
FAA said it's already obtained plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the plane.
Delta and Jetblu are among those who have already presented plans.
FAA said in a statement, "We can be very quick to allow electronic use of the electronic device.
However, the passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the airport is closed.
They are expected to not continue until they reach the height of 10,000 feet of the plane and are allowed by Captain.
The passengers are expected to stop their device when they get down on the plane, and don't run it until the plane is completely down.
FAA said the airlines under new directions, which are completely safe from the airlines, may allow their passengers to be able to use the airlines, when the plane is down, and when the telescope is down.
Most new Airline companies and other airlines that have been modified so that the travelers can use the yhea on higher heights are expected to meet these values.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of the Professional Flight Indent, welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy will be effective in a safe way - and we'll work together with the airlines company to do so - it's a winning thing for both sides."
When it comes to this point, we've been warming up like "Hol Moniters."
Agnes said that the Internet will still be blocked by connecting to less than 10,000 feet and returning, e-mail-reaching, sending or getting the message, or downloading data.
The passengers will be told to keep their smartphone, tablet, and other devices in Airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, like online scratchball, which is the popular event that occurred when actor Elke Boldwin was playing on his smartphone during the airport, in 2011, and the American Airlines had removed from the airlines to stop the device.
And we still have to collect the laptops, like the heavy instruments, because they will be concerned about harming the other person in Kebin.
The cellphone calls will continue to be blocked during the flight.
Virginic rights are near the United Nations Communication Association, not with FAA.
The ban on some electronic devices can be removed while filling and moving the airplane.
Last month, Mark Roncan, a national transportation specialist in the National Security Department of National Security, said that the cell phone is still in danger.
Ronkar said, "Phones are really serious issues, but not because they can possibly create obstacles in the navigation-related device, but because they can also create obstacles in the cell phone towers when they are in the air.
To test this issue by FAA, the U.S. Communication Committee of the World Constitution Committee concluded that the government should allow the use of the personal electronic device to be used.
To reduce restrictions from them, FAA has increased pressure in recent years.
San. Claire Maccasquick, such as D-Mo, has said that there is no valid security reason for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult because the use of the device is irrelevant.
Some study also suggests that almost a third of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions to stop their device.
FAA started the use of ellectronic devices by passengers in 1996 when the passengers received a report of invitation and communicating devices on the networks and on the high-minded gages of F.M. radio and time.
New Airlines companies, more depend on electronic systems than the previous generation of airlines, but they are also designed and accepted to resist electronic intervention by FAA.
Airlines have been proposing Y-Fi on crossing height from passengers for years.
The Wi-Fi system is also more resistant to the plane inhibited.
Hurta said that most Airlines companys should be electronic to use more than the new direction-direction device.
Today's electronic device, a very low-popular radio transmission of the previous generation, is incredibly lower than the electronic device.
For example, E-Readers, the total transmission of the name when the page is rotated.
But transmission is possible when downloading or sending data by device.
Amazon.com is also among the people who have taken an interest in the use of the device.
In 2011, the company's officials loaded their entire bank e-readers in Airlines and launched them to test the problems, but there was no such problem.
The FAA adviser committee expressed a mixing emotions about the dangers of using the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Air Force Union said that they believe the immune system is real, even if the risk is a nameless.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by pilots that support the device in the Aircraft system, most of them are very old.
However, members of the committee suggested that the FAA pilot will allow them to command the passengers to stop the device while they are down to the low view.
The journey industry group has welcomed changes and said to them, the common knowledge of people who travel in the latest economy.
The U.S. Trawell Association of the C.R.R.D. said that we're happy that FAA has not been recognized as a traveler with joy, security and security.
Learning from the conservative bombs in Panana, the UT police have cut the corpse of Maddenzer Divalley and the time of infectional conditions.

The bird was left back in the wilderness to protect from North C Reg from the air transport

Is Europe’s high class ready to work with Britain?
In April, the Bigenes Fore Britain was launched and promised to bring the business together and decide what the worker and the production of U.S. Creator wants to see in our relationship with the U.S.
For him we arranged the largest and the largest investigators in Britain, and asked them what their views about the British business with EU.
U-Gove, for the view of 1000 business leaders, representing the business size of Britain, regions, and locations.
The conclusion of this survey may be astounding to many people.
We found that a large part of the businesses now want to export out of Europe, and they want to focus on the countries that are becoming and expanding, while the EU. members are rapidly moving.
They want the government to prefer new business relationships with countries such as China, India, and Brazil, not the galaxy of the secretary organizations.
When asked their thoughts about specific policy fields, such as the investment law, most business leaders believed that the control of these qualifications should come back to Westminster.
The common inconvenience could be quite easily seen, according to the businessmans, the price of Brussels' Winemone is more than the advantages of being part of Europe's commercial field - even 40 percent of the large businessmen who were opposed by traditional European companies.
In the end and most obviously, our investigators found that a large part clearly wanted British, rather than political and constitution change.
The conclusion, which was seen in the levels of the major business groups, indicates that the businessmen are moved to a "alternative change" that would restore its loss of power to UK.
It's very high price - the point of the constitution change for Britain and a better deal has changed 16 percent of the opinions in the United States to remain in EU.
Prime Minister should not be in doubt: This survey reports that British businessmen support their plans to talk about the terms of the Britannica's subscription in EU.
It also shows that the businessmen expect to change a simple change to defend the current power balance of the U.S.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is rapidly necessary, since Eurogen, administrative economy, and the royal organization.
Privately, the work must be increased in Britain, as the conclusions of our survey indicate that the businesses have a new centered attention on business and basic changes to the Winomonal Activity of Brussels.

Before the charges against Jonathan Locke, two of the employees were accused of sexual crimes, Roal Commission announced.
In 2011, Caringbaah’s child carekeeper, Jonathan Larard, was accused of two workmates of child sex crimes.
But in his statement to the Agency, he said, "It never came under his organization the case of child sexual abuse," was reported to the Agency.
The chief activist Philip Hare was asked about the case of a worker who was accused of child pornography crimes, and another case in which he was accused of child sex crime in 1991 against children who cared for him.
Mr. Hire said they knew about the matter before, but they didn't know about other matters.
He also acknowledged that the word "YMCA has been checked out of "YMCA" and that he has found the most in front of the child security."
In front of the Agency, it is a testimony that the YMCA was notified, and this year, in August, it received four possible ratings in the education and the community participation of the United States.

He said, rather, their friendship with Lord led their decision to inform them about him.
Mr. Hare said he gave his view to the U.S.D. M. M.M.M.Mdbul, that the text for the organization was "not informative" from "Jonathan Lockard Event".
Mr. Hare said that soon after the charges arrived, the decision was made to sign the secret agreement by the workers, the child service manager Leim Whitle.
He said that it was to be avoided by the conspiracy of the testimony, but it was not executed properly.
The gravitational investigation of child sex in the University of Griffith, Professor Stephen Smalbon, said that it wasn't a safe organization between 2099 and 2011 when Jonathon Lockard was working on the work of Jonathon since 2011.

On the carrier, 1000 pounds (011,000) were beaten by a hot drone between the feet.
The 35-year-old Andro Hovy of Tippary, a 35-year-old Andro Hovy, was seen running on his Marsides Benge in Britain at A120.
When the police stopped them, they found their tattoo-away drives.
In Colchaster Magistrate court, Hovy accepted the campaign to drive car from lapse.
Their license has added seven points, which resulted in the ban on driving during six months.
The Hovie was also commanded to load the slope of 90 pounds and 100 pounds.
Private property will end in London's comprehensive state.
The Vatican Section is primarily calculated of the C.G.T. options, but Mr. Osburn is waiting for the final decision, which is worth more than 2 million pounds in the year 2012, and someone who prefers to stay home in a company rather than a petty person, for 7 percent of the stamp dutty was present by rate.
In 2012/13, westminster and Kansington were in 708 Millennial Pounds of Indigenous Institutes of the Citys of Patmos, which already had more than 70 million in North Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West West and West Yorkshire.
Mr. Kuke said: "It's very difficult to argue that the high value of proposal is at least a tax, which is not related to the effect of the old transmission system.
He added, "but this action can be a sluggish in buying some foreign regimes in London and aggressive to sell the current survival."
Prime proprietary, the highest 5 to 10 percent of the house market, which is expanded from the Florida to Wimbaldon, has increased the last year 118 percent.
According to Sawils' discovery, each year the regular growth of the values of Central London was increased by 5.6 percent, but the increases seemed to be less than "the houseboat", since the city's southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent).
The scientists have revealed more about what is between the actions of the dog and his brain.
The past discoveries have shown that the happy dogs move their double to the right (to the left), while the wild dogs sweep their feathers on the left.
But scientists now say that friends can identify this complex secret of the chicken and express their reaction on it.
This study has been published in Journal Kront bilozi.
From the University of Trentoisist Professor Georgeia Wellertigara said: “Man knows well that the left and right parts of the brain are differently involved in the emotions that produce positive or negative feelings."
Here we have tried to see it also in other states.
He said that like men, the right part of the brain was responsible for the actions of the left hand, and the opposite order, and the two controversies played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the twilight by other dogs, researchers watched animals on the movies of other dogs.
And they measured the straw of the dogs' heart, and their conduct was incorporated.
We'll probably not take too much time to understand why their double moves to the other side.
Pro. Wellertigera said: "We presented dogs with the films of dogs - in a photograph to deal with the realistic version or with other issues, and we could see the scene of the back, and we could present the back to the left or to the left."
And it came to pass, when the beasts saw a dog flying on his right hand, that they were filled with peace.
But when they saw the fish turning in the direction, and turning to the left (to the dog's side), their heart was lifted up, and they were troubled.
According to Pro. Wellertigara, they don't think the dogs were talking to each other through these actions.
Rather, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience what they should be concerned about and what they should not do.
They said, "If you have met other dogs many times, and if they push their back on one side, it is more friendly, and the right part presents a less friendly act, you respond to the same experience."
According to researchers, these conclusions can provide better information about the feelings of animals, animals, and teachers.
Institute of Bristol's School of Veterinary Synciss, expert John Bradshaw said that it is not the first study to check whether dogs are important to the left or to the right.
Last year, the team of the University of Linkon found that when dogs see a rare dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the happy dog to the right.
In other search for the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Arverse to the intelligence - when the boss of the robots were moved to the left, it was more likely that the dogs would be insignificant than the dogs.
He said that this was because the dogs in various studies did not think the animals or the robots dogs were completely brown.
They explained that it can help study the way the real dogs react to the facts.
"As various sculptors have found a lot of evidence that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still available-- and there are no dogs in this case."
However, the easy way their behavior can be put in, it seems that we will probably not take too much time to understand why their problems sometimes move on the other side.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
Vatican announced गुरुवार that Pope Francis will make the first Catholic cardinal in his workday.
Cardinals, the Catholic Church, are priests of the highest classes, their position is only below the pope, and those who choose the pope, therefore Frances will relocate the first group of their people, who will eventually help them choose their inheritance.
Now there are 200 cardinals.
Similarly, after the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to share in the election of the pope - it comes into the group of 120 "cardinal Selector".
In a time of announcement, Vatican Prime Minister Fadriko Lombardy said that before the new cardinals were started, all present cardinals will be held together, which is called the Pop-separa.
Lombardi said, "Pop Francis has already decided to make his decision to organize the post-procession of February, so that it would be easy to plan other gatherings of cardinals shared in the world."
Jeck Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February the time the cardinal elections had the chance to reduce their number.
He said that Pope normally, the number of cardinal selectors is less than 120, as well as the name of cardinals, as well as the age of 80, according to their wishes.
Wellero said that the next year's pope will be important, since this year it will be the first post-separate after France was selected in March.
Currently, Europe and especially Italy are a form of prejudice.
He said, "It's interesting to see if new popes in order to reestablish balance, even cardinals from the rest of the world.
There are 40 percent of Roman Catholics in South America, but their number is very small in cardinals.
The first cardinals will be selected after the reform of the church, which is a group of eight cardinals around the world.
Before the pope decided everything himself.
Valero said, " still France has chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said that it's possible to ask Francis Cardinills for advice.
But we're not in this situation first - it's really new.
We don't know who they will call.
In order to correct the seatback by g.m. returned packup trucks in US
On Friday, according to an information from the U.S. On-O security vendors, General Motors company, called about 19,000 trucks back to correct a lack of sylverla Silverdado and G.M. Sierra Picup trucks in their entirely new 2014.
In some trucks, there may be a lack of control in the way to rotate the French seat.
As a result, the organization was unable to follow the auto security standards about Sitback, Head Resistant.
According to a report on the National Railway Security Administration, "If the drive falls back, the head restraint will not be safe in the right way, which will increase the risk."
The call models were rebuilt between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM truck began to be sent to June and, in 2009, it represents the most important thing for the top U.S. automaker after the release of the GMC trucks.
G.M. told the truck surmies about this problem at the end of October.
The government ban on 16 days of the NTSTM, which had forced the increase in Oto's business in October, could not be reviewed for the request.
G.M. said to Friday, Silverdo and Sierra trucks who were regenerated for the year 2014 were regenerated in selling 20 percent of the 20th month.
The G.M. sold 42,660 Sylverdo and 16503 Sierra Picup truck.
On Friday afternoon, New York Stack Xchenz had 1.4 percent of g.M. sheer.
The Depression of Obama’s Advocates
I gave Obama twice as much as I expected to change
They say Obama's great efforts have been interrupted because of the policy of the GOP.
Observatory policy of the obamakeer website can't offer drone attacks
The 2008 Campaign of Obama reminds us of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris Harvard Medical School has students in second year.
I'm reading very painful books today.
This is a book about which I think this second year will enthusiast me and raise hope in me.
The name is "the courage to win," and it is a constitution of the 2008 presidential election campaign in Berak Obama.
When I find my patients in the night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time in which the political motivated millions of people and the talks could stop your breath.
Choices proved to be unsuccessful, and news speakers took rest to represent the history of that time.
My fellows had tears of joy in my eyes, and my father and my mother saved every report.
A group of youths were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008, when Obama became president, they had 82% of authorization rating.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, such as from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they remember a distance, a painful memory of missing occasions.
I've really changed after the first time I've been kicked.
I couldn't imagine any of it.
I thank Obama for many benefits, from Afrodebel Keer Ett to return to our army from Iraq, until the end of Osama Ben Laden's death.
I also believe that the policy of partial opposition has prevented many efforts to advance our country: foreign improvements, public options for health services, shut the drum on Gwenmo Bay, and other other.
But the number of times I took myself to the Obama Administration with fellow workers and colleagues - the answer ends to me so that I could give them.
I've reached the point of political depression.
The opposing policy of Republic is not the answer of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to the drone attacks on children in foreign countries.
This national security agency cannot answer the facts about the personal life of the American citizens, nor can the promotion of those who launch the wrong actions of the government.
It can't explain why American citizen Anver El Alaki was murdered without a train, nor the public demands and restrictions of the president's office during the camp.
It can't answer the conclusions of the report, which says that efforts to silence the media by the White House have been "the most controversy since the Nixon Administration."
And recently, it can't offer a simple website to design a failure after three years of signing to the Afrodebel case law.
I don't know if I expected it.
If, in 18 years of age, I had to guess that the government system could destroy the political campaign that will bring it forward.
It's obvious that the official office is not a preliminary way, since the anti-religious political team and memorable events, such as Newtown Cities, will shape our public discussion.
Nevertheless, most of the examples I have set up, they seem to have been chosen by the administration.
It's the most disturbing of you.
I revoted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was angry with his expectations.
Mit Romani presented a survival and an unexplained option, which seems to be not to determine their policy or position.
I thought another job for Obama, which will be free from the pressures of future choices, will fulfill the hopes we have heard for long time.
Nevertheless, while Obama's permission is less than 45% of the week, it has become difficult to return to 2008 through that book.
I remember their failing promises to see him.
In this week, Clinton was reading a part of the book that was described as a great loss for Obama in Pennsylvania Primeri.
In a post-martum camping meeting, he told his slaves that they needed to return to the parliament, and needed to remain loyal to their purposes.
He said, "I want to get my measure back."
We should remember who we are.'
I can't agree with you more than five years later.

Banks are checking faster messages and e-mail for years to be searched for in an incorrect operation.
Regarding test-reading, news has played in the trailers of the area, who have been among the most profitable in the country's trailing units for the past years, but they have to face this year's challenge, because less than-white-reading has been reduced in the case.
Some bankers tried to press the matter by saying that it was too big and too large for the Liquid foreign curiosity that was impossible to watch in the Exchange market, but the large trailers said it wasn't necessary to be true.
The Great Traffic Trailer said that even though the largest variation of the foreign currency of Creek, the use of Liquidity and its own Platform means "You can start to affect the market on a little little ticket value."
The news came on the same day, on the day Credit Swiss announced to the train from his Exchange Tradedes Densk in London to be served this week, which killed about 6 million people in the end of the last year.
The bank immediately advised the authorizations and cooperated with his lawyers.
"We believe that the trainer was working alone, and he was handled."

We celebrate the artificial triods of the cartoon fish.
The bow is the god of wealth, and the god of Kuber, and the god of Meraz.
Our religion is the important place of wealth in life.
There's no wealth that's good.
Good-good is our emotions for wealth.
There can be no more value than the good of man's good, but the riches that become proud doesn't mean anything.
Let us make the riches of the glory of holiness, and let us eat of the holy purpose.
To earn wealth for the family's full-production is the duty of every person.
It should also have a sense of humor on society, but the tendency to overreact unscrupulous collections or ven-ken-like wealth is to destroy our conscience, personality.
The emotion of the gift should be always in mind.
Even a part of the money you have given can be the foundation of the life of someone.
We all need to think about many people living in a terrible state in society.
In fact, the manna of life has the same value, religion, work, and mortar.
All men seek riches and success, and they have riches and success according to their deeds.
That is the riches that is bound to honor.
How much more shall a man be rich, and he shall not be able to enjoy it, neither shall he profit another.
Don't envy anyone else if he has wealth.
He that is truly rich hath made his way in the multitude of riches.
No one can profit more than the worker's work.
Another thing, wealth isn't just as a curiosity.
It would also be as your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the owner of this treasure.

The slave Hasan Khan said I've got security cover since 1996.
I dwell in the vault of terrorists.
A security account of the CRPF at my home was in the leader of all inspectors.
There are also court guards with me, but all my security was taken suddenly.
When the security was going from my house, I spoke to Die Jaye Solutions and Jay SP.

It was not until two years (2001-2002) by the government's no announcement was made by the government for the last two years (in the year 1999 and 2004) in the reign of NDA's monarchy.
On Thursday, in Gujarat's cavalry, the president's 182 meters of the "Steachu of Unity" image, Modi said, "for the first time, there was no advisor at the time of the president's survival."
While DAVP records show that UPA spent 30 million in 2009-10, 2010-10 million money, 2.7 million dollars in 2011-12, and 1.4 million dollars in 2012-13.

The UPA year did not bring any advertisements on the plate in 2008.

Walking by dust, rivers, and forests to provide free medical service
Dr. Georges Well, in Cameroon’s rural areas, there are free health services
Wells and their team see hundreds of diseases each week
In West Africa there is no more medical treatment; only 5000 people have a medical
Give your vote here or the mobile.
Dr. Georges Well in 2013 is one of the top 10 leaders of the CNN.
You can vote for them or for someone to make a leader of CNN. years.
The winner will get 250,000 dollars to continue his unusual work.
For 21 years, Georges Well saw his sick father coming to the hospital and being unconscious, going to the hospital, who had no suitable provisions to help them.
Jamel Welle, in 1981, was in a car accident near Cameroon's capital, Yode.
At first their hands were broken, but an immunity spread to their brain, and he built blood pressure, which affected their remaining life.
Georges Well says, "There was no Newrosion in Cameroon."
If we had money, we would have brought our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, they took their father with a large crowd of clinic and hospitals full of clinic and hospitals and received any treatment they could get.
He said, “This is not easy.”
You get out of the house at 5:00 a.m. you'll be the first person to reach the hospital, but it doesn't happen.
There are many sick people.
Some may be waiting and waiting in the face of death.
There has not been a great change in the situation since Well's father's death in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one medical process for every 5000 people in Cameroon.
If we compare, the United States has a doctor for each 413 people.
And if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameroon can't pay her money.
Two of the five live in the country under poverty, and about two thirds of health services in the country are the private region.
Well says, "They're just a problem of poverty."
And because they are poor, they cannot take their life.
And it came to pass, when they saw the affliction of their father and of their brethren, that they resolved to satisfy it.
His team of Dr. Georges and volunteers has done 700 free medical treatment last year.
They also became doctors, and they worked as a Wiscular Sergeon in the Central Hospital of Yode.
And they started a non-lave organization Escowim, who goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical service.
Since 2008, they and their own self-servative group have helped about 32,000 people.
nearly every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the Van, the doctors bind the patients from the roof, and go to rural areas where people need medical care.
Never kind of doesn't have to be with them.
They have to push the vehicle through rivers and dust.
But when they reach, they really have the honor of the leaders: the best holidays that can be presented by the community.
These villages have really a cause for free medical service, and they are happy with their great smile and endless energy.
Their team starts meeting hundreds of patients the next morning.
Well said, "We're meeting 500 people in every journey."
They come from village about 60 kilometers, and they walk.
All these weeks, Clinic provides different medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, infectious diseases, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people can get surveillance, gifts, or free birth certificates -- the need for this document is in school, but many poor families can't spend it.
In the evening, the team starts with the local symposium.
Operations are usually done at school's house, at Town Hall, or home; after the process, the patient goes to the retirement place, and builds a place for the next person.
The generator of the group publishs in the room and the sensitivity tools, and they and their own self-survival work at dawn.
It's a commodious speed, but musicians usually help keep the team inspiration.
Wells said, "They play the drums all night to keep us alive and to continue their work."
On Sunday, their team returns to the city, they're tired, but they're proud of their work.
This group - including the medical and foreign medical students of Cameroon - last year 700 free medical treatments, and they know that their help can change the world of those who help them.
One man said that he would be able to go back to work because he received free Herniya's medicine.
He said, "This will change my future with my family."
In addition to working as clinic in the hospital, they also work in private medical clinic around Yode in the night.
He said that this is his second job that affects 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is full of personal contributions.
In Philadelphia, the second year of Draxel University's second year's medical student and self-servative in the Wel's group, Cathy O'Meli said, "I don't know when they are sleeping."
They're always in the hospital, or they're trying to earn money for their organization so they're running these campaigns.
This is an integral opportunity for students from the United States and Europe who come from the Waal campaign, such as O'Mali, who are not able to get in their country.
O'Mali said, "We help to hold the tool for Dr. Wall or clean the blood plasma, we're able to find an industrial experience."
You will never be able to do this as a second year's medical student in the United States.
In order to reach Cameroon, the self-separate students usually use their own side, and they often come with the doctors of the donations.
But after the Yode arrives, they live in Anna-known, and spend the amount of instructions.
O'Mali says, "There's no doubt they're hero."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never be satisfied.
For Well, about one kind of work, it's not difficult.
To help others live a happy life, to fulfill the promise made to their father, these are things that give them great joy.
Well says, "I'm so happy to do this work."
And I think of my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to laugh people, to reduce their pain.
