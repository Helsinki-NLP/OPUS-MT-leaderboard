The Macedonians vote on whether to rename the country
The people of the Macedonians changed the name of "Republic of Messedia" and a democratic vote on whether it would be "Republic of the North Messedia", a step that would solve the conflict with Greece for a few decades that prevented the European Union and Nataro membership.
Greece, where there is a country of Macedonia, represents the name of its neighbor, a claim to his land, and enters Nato and European Union.
The two governments have made a agreement on the new name, but nationalist opposition feels that this change will change the racial identity of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Georg Ivanv said he would not vote on the democracy and question whether the Ternout would fill 50 percent of the lowest of the population to be valid in the public campaign.
The question was: "You have a treaty with Greece and members of the European Union."
Recognizing the name of the Prime Minister Joran Zaev, the supporters have expressed the value of the European Union and Nato Constitution for the second Macedonian countries from Yugoslavia.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country today for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live in the European Union because it means safe for all of us," said Oliver Georgezevski Scopje, 79-year-old.
Though not obligatory in law, the members of the constitution have said that they will follow the vote’s result by making decisions.
To rename requires two-three estimation in the sensor.
The Kingdom election Commission said that no news was found on the 1st of the Nagad Union.
However, more than 34 percent of the National Parliament elections in 2016, only 16 percent of the registered voters have voted 66 percent.

His wife, Joran Zaev, and his son in Mesopotamia were voted to change the country's name for democracy, which will open the way for Nato and European Union in Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardakv, a 54-year-old man in front of the Skopje Parliament, was preparing a small stage in front of those who would eradicate the democracy.
"We're in front of Nato and European Union, but we don't have the door of the service, but we want to raise our head up."
"We're a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don't want to be our Macedonia, we can go to other people like China and Russia and become a part of the Euro-Asia set."
Prime Minister Zaev said that the NATO membership will bring the necessary arrangements in Macedonia, where the 20 percent of corruption is over.
"I believe the large number of people will be on the side of our 80 percent of European Union and Natto," said Zaev after his ballat.
He said that a "yes" result will be our "assessment of the future."
A report published by the Institute for Police Research in Macedonia said that 30 to 43% of votings needed to be part of the necessary vote.
Another report by Telma TV in the Macedonian, 57 percent of the respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
The 70 percent said they would vote yes.
To succeed in the democracy, more than 50 percent must be vote.
Since the failure of democracy last May will represent the first death in the government's policy.

Tramps in West Virginia
During the Middle elections, the president pointed out the situation of Bret Kavana, who chose his superprimal court to be the key to republican voting.
"We're all in trouble in November of what we've done.
Five weeks away from the most important election of our life.
It's a big, big-- but I'm really running because I've filled all the places to fight for the poor candidates.
Tramp continued, "You see the horrible Democratic Dictional Groups, and you're looking at it now.
And you see the lowest, gentleness of any way they need to take power back.
They are stinging on anyone, and they have to go after power and control, not giving them anything but power and control, and we will not give them this.

Labar is no longer a free organization.
I don't have to be patient here for those who have the mind.
When the workers of the party in my area blamed me, it wasn't a surprise.
Because, your heart will not be welcomed here - I was the last lab of the list to tell you that.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan found the same way because he stood firm against the Jewish science.
In my case, I was accused of discrimination with Jeremy Carmen.
Regarding the importance of a responsible financial policy, Europe and National Security and similar events, which did not agree with the former leaders.
On Friday NTingham East Lebar meeting said "We want to include and product our meetings."
In my eight years as a local laber MP, it's just like the GC meting in the first Friday night.
Sadly, today, it isn't sour of the meeting and the promise to the "Dalu, gentleness" politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It is advisable that the Lebar Party is not to be treated differently and that every opinion is judged whether it is acceptable for the group leadership.
After Jeremy was leader, I thought that I had a similar political view of the colleagues and asked them to take a position that I would never have been ruled - whether national security or you units.
Every time I talk in public, and no matter what I say, I'm invited to get away by social media, the center's politics, and I'm told that I should not stay in the laber party.
And it's not just my own experience.
Actually, I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because they're also political.
I've been surprised to see all the colleagues who face the storms of conflict or rape on the basis of gender or genocide.
The most disappointing of politics in this world is how garbagelessness has become normal.
Jeremy Kurmin demanded that the Lebar Party should develop the culture oflerance last week.
The fact is that we are not yet free organizations, and each "nationatta" vote or election regressors group.
For the past two years, many have advised me to put my head down, not so fast, and I'll be "right"
But I came to politics and didn’t do this.
When I joined Laber 32 years ago, we were in a position by the government of the Thachar government that was evacuated by the classes of our widely devastated schools, and then I tried to give the necessary government services — whether local Council or government minister.
I never hid my politics with the last election.
No one in Natingham East has ever been confused about my policy and the differences between the current leadership.
For those who preached to this movement on Friday, I will only say that when the country is heading towards a bridge that will damage family, business institutions, and our population, I can't understand my loyalty to the Lebanese leader and my time and energy.
But I don't really have any message for the NTingham Momentum, whether it is to my elections, members of the Levite: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no non-sense threat or political intensity will prevent me from accepting your best.
Kris Lesley is an MPP of NTingham East.

John Edward: The language skills of the world are needed
The free schools of Scotland have held a track record of academic gravity, and in 2018, it has continued with another unprecedented test resulting from the efforts of both races, arts, music, and other communities that have been strengthened by personal and constitutional success.
With more than 30,000 students in the Scottish Council of Independent School (SCIS), the schools are trying to serve their students and parents in the best level.
Individual schools set the goal of preparing for their position as their educational students, their chosen careers, and the world's citizens.
As a educational field that can apply to a special school-reader design, we see the modern language continue to be popular and popular in schools.
Nelson Mandela says: "If you talk to someone in the language he understands, it's in his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, he's going to be in his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to make relationships and faith with people of other countries.
From the recent test of this year, we see the languages that are on the top of the lyg tables with the largest patches in the separate schools.
Indigenous students of foreign languages, 68 percent of the top grades have acquired in the top 68 percent.
From the 74 members of the SCIS school found that 72 percent of the students in Mandariine developed high grades when 72 percent of German studies were conducted in the French study and 63 percent of Spanish studies.
This proves that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as an infinite skill that must be needed in the future of children and youth.
Now, as a matter of choice, the symptom of the individual school and somewhere else the STEM topics (scientific, technological, and mathematician) are the same.
In a survey of UK's Commission and Schills in 2014, officials blamed for the reason they had given them to complete their language skills.
So more, the language skills have become obsessed to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are needed in the world for more possible ways.
Anybody who chooses Caribbean, if they learn another language, they will benefit with their lifetime skills in the future.
A person who is able to communicate directly with the people of the country is automatically before competing a multilingual person.
According to UGV, more than 4,000 young people in 2013, 75 percent of the conversations were not able to speak in a foreign language, and 15 percent of the French languages were the only language of the decade.
This is why it is important for today's children to have a language education.
Many languages, especially developing economy, give children a better chance to find a meaningful workplace.
In Scotland, each school will be divided into their educational languages.
Many schools will focus on other classic modern languages, on the other hand, on 2020, it is shown that others will learn the language that is most important to Yuk, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest may be, there are many languages in which he will always have a special teacher.
Scottish independent schools are required to prepare for a educational environment that will prepare the children and create them with the skills needed to succeed in the future.
In the world's business environment it is not allowed to deny the language that plays a vital role in the future of the country, therefore it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "the skill of international communication."
Individual schools will provide this choice for youths in Scotland.
It must be done.

The North Korea says "No way" will not be regulated alone without faith.
North Korea's Minister, Shanbar, said to the United States that the ban on the present state has increased and that there is no chance to leave the country’s paramilitary weapons together.
In the annual annual session of Ryang Ho Ho, North Korea said that in the last year, the tests of genetic and survival test, the nuclear test, and the threat of nuclear technology and nuclear weapons has taken "a positive action".
"We haven't seen any similar reaction in the United States."
"Unless we don't have any confidence in the United States, we don't have any confidence in our national security, and there is no way to separate ourselves from our national situation."
Although the "strong" method of Washington's "strong" was described by the North Korean complaints in contrast with the way that the North Korea would be rewarded because of the slowness of action, his statement was so convicted that he did not put the paramediment together, because Pyongyang has also done it in the past.
The first convention in the US president and North Korean leader in June 12 gave a share in the kim Jong Won and Donald Tramp, when Kim promised to work with the paranoids of Korea, and when Trophim gave the protection of North Korea.
North Korea is looking for the final end of the war in 1950-53, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first leave his nuclear weapons.
Washington also protested international bans on North Korea.
"America has forced the "Divism" and has forced the ban on their intentions, even against the announcement of the end of the war," said Ry.
"The dictators can sneak our ground with a dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem has been that the restrictions continue to deepen our faith. "
There was no commenting on the second head convention in Rykim and Tramp, which took place in the United Nations in the first week of the United States.
In the past five months, the Minister Mohodai and South Korea leader Mun Zain pointed out three continents: “If the United States were not the southern Korea, it would not be uncomfortable for the constitution of the Korean subcontinent."
Even so, the speech of Rye was not strictly different since the last year, when he told the U.N. general community to target the U.S. government by targeting the U.S. cockets by the North Korean Racket when the "MEV President" Tram Kim was forced to say "Ruck Man".
In the United Nations, Tramp, last year, threatened the "full destruction of North Korea", he commended Kim for his courage to take action, but he said that there will still be a lot of work and that bans will be restricted until the end of the North Korea.
Wednesday Tramp said that it has no time to do it, he said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded to take care of the U.N. security constitution.
However, the United States Secretary of State Mike Pomp also reported to Americans: "Budday Security Council has to continue the bans of security until we are not fully aware of the expedition."
In 2006, the most restrictive ban on North Korea was to stop the parliamental and bastic surveillance of security.
Pomp also met Rie in the United Nations General Assembly in Assamil, and then said he would return to Pyongyang in the next month to prepare the second assembly.
Pompeii has already passed three trips in North Korea, but his final trip was not good.
He said the time to leave Pyongyang in July, something has been progressed, just a few hours ago to condemn him as "Gunda"!
North Korea promised the meeting to be held in a missile site with Munn in this month and a New York Times Complex Jungle if the United States accepts the "separate arrangement".
He said that Kim said he was the security that he had given to Tramps Singapore and his security guarantees to make the relationship with Washington normally.

The information was published in the United States, including the home and phone number of the U.S. Senators, the South Carolina Linda, and the Mick Lee and Orin Hatch, both U.S.A.
On Thursday, this information has been published online, posted an unknown person on the Internet to hear about the charges of sexual abuse against the former candidate.
It was just a while after questioning the three sensors of Kavanna.
Gateways and Redstitutes, such as Gateways and Redstitutes, reported that the IP address was linked to the "Watters" office, and reported a member of the Waters Workers.
"This uninvited charges are full of lies and lies, and the Waters continue.
"The members of my employees, whose identity, personal information, and protection were issued because of the witchcraft and false charges - no way it was not responsible for trapping.
This uninvited charge is completely wrong and a lie.
The news of Waters has soon received an interrogation in online with the former press SCEB ARI Fliser, the White House.
"This is an indestructible regime," writes Flisher.
"It says he doesn't have the desire to be a member of the Congress.
When no one is accused of what they did, they won't be angered.
They mustn't be a protester.
They shouldn't ask about the purpose of the complainer.
They must be calm and upright.
Democratics' response to the judge's slogans was compared to the reaction of the Waters, Flishir, who heard the twentiethdays, and the critics thought he was aggressive.
Republican candidate Omar Navaro, who chooses to vote Waters in the Middle election, has also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If true, it's big," he tweets.
According to Watters, his office has warned of "the officials and law-wide organizations that are responsible for their claims."
"We will make sure that the criminals will be revealed," he continued, "and their legal responsibility will be for all of my workmates and for all of my members and for the devastating and devastating of their actions."
Johnny English Strykes Agency - weak Roan Atkinson Secretary
Brexi Tirque is now traditional to see any new image with which Brexit has been astronomical and it seems to be a renewal for popular English activism-Camedy Spuf Francis - which started in 2003, and came back to Johnny English in 2011.
Clearly, how many of us are poor people will be able to do that self-defense?
In any case, pop-qualified, riotless people have license to create new things like the second time - any other name suggests that he is designing a large computer designed for other languages without English.
He must certainly have shared a note on the site of Shariuts of Fair Theme Town in the Mister Bin and a dolphin of Chap in 2012.
He's based on the main trainer, and the man Atkinson of the international secret once misunderstood the Barclickcard TV advertisements, spreads a stunning dissension in science.
The last Jei is one or two unfortunate moments.
I liked to see John English come to a helicopter in a railway with a small helmet with the ratter's clothes in the middle of the jungle.
The gift of Atkinson is shown for the physical surgeon, but it has become very low and so strange, especially "Syrias" philosopher Brond has now become an element of self-trust.
The fact is that it has been aimed to children more than adults, and I don't have to be like the jokes of Atkinson-Synamer of Atkinson.
It's a serious problem with the Great Britain base of Topcal.
One of the cyber hacker found a very secret web network in Britain, to identify all the British agents in the field, to destroy the responsible agents - to sadly grieve for Kevin's building.
This is the last trust of a Prime Minister who has already experienced the full democracy of politics, he is unsatisfied and unconscious: Ama Thmpson has been accused of his supervisor in the middle of the script, but there is nothing more to work on the script.
His guests advised him that every active secretary was accepted, so he had to get somebody out of his home.
And it means that Johni English, who is now appointed as a school instructor in some five weeks, teaches out of the record how to be sixteen workers: There's a good story here, because English has a school in Guendagarir's Stock-Tape.
He returned to English White for the Briffing, and again in Ben Miller's case, Ben Miller reunited with his long-compliant cidic bus.
Bau is now married to a married man, married to a former commander, the role of a juli-Hoki-stick, including Vicky Pepperdine.
So Har Majstis Cricket Service has returned to the Batman and Robin Acrony, a foreign woman of Olga Kurenko.
In fact, Prime Minister Carishmatik has been smuggled in Billionia, who claims that he can solve the problems of the British computers: the sinist Payson Valley.
English and Bau started a strange word of their super-productive high-gene: they took a fire in a Flash French rastroy; they started to swollen in the Balsaboll boat; and attempted to get to know themselves from the house of Ingliss Valley.
All the posts must have been picked for the end of the course, but it's as sweet and worn, there's a lot of children's thoughts in the whole matter.
It's a lot of middle Stuff.
And I can't think like other popular English movies: The British film can't have any role in the Roman Atkinson that is justifying its representation?
Leber refused that it was planning for Briton to work four days a week, but it would be paid for five days.
The Jeremy Leber Party will consider a basic plan to work four days a week — but for five days.
The group demands that the organization's owners share the funds of an extra day sale through the revolution (AI).
It's going to be a three-day holiday- but it's still going to be in the same market.
The source said that this idea would be "fit" with the group's financial activities and have plans to move the country to work.
Trades Union Congress allowed to be transferred to a four-day week as an opportunity to have the opportunity to change financially.
A senior part of the Laber Party told the Times: "I hope a policy will be declared before the end of the year."
'It won't happen, but it's a desire for four days to work on the workshop of the worker's entire artists to protect the economy's economy.'
Not the first to support this national idea, the Green Party promised the four days of their general election campaign in 2017.
The desire is not currently supported by the Laber Party, even though it is not.
A member of the Leber Party said: 'It's not a four-day workday party policy, and it is not considered as a group'
Shado Chansonel, John McDonald, used the work ceremony last week to reveal his view of a social revolution.
Mr. McDonald says he's determined to return power from the 'Reported Director' and 'Lavbans' in the sub-profit organizations.
Shareholders of Shado Chansonel's plan may even be able to get their whole part back because the work government could give 'a little 'black' because of the wrongs that the worker did.
He also ensured that the organization's plan to keep the workmates on the board to protect 10 percent of the industrialized economy and that the owner's owners are standing in $500.
Say to John Kennedy "60 minutes" that can change their mind in kavana's FBI.
EFBI has delayed the final vote on his elections in a week, and the searches of barracks have raised questions about whether a republican serator can support them.
In a news report on Sunday, the newsmagazine Scott Pelly Republican Senators asked whether John Kennedy and Linds Graham can discover what FBI can guide their minds to change.
Kennedy was more open than his colleagues from South Carolina.
"Oh, of course," Kennedy said.
"I was asking to go to the hearing, and I said, I talked to the judge Kavana.
After this incident, I called him, and the complaint came out, saying, 'Did you do it?'
He was strongly determined, unrealistic."
Graham vote, of course, seems unfortunate.
"My mind has been set on my braet Kavana and a major complaint will be needed to change," he said.
"D. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret has severely rejected it," mentioning Christine Blaci Ford.
"Abbong, whose name he said they could not verify.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see any new changes."

Global Citizen answered: "This will be a long and hard way - we will never read and fail.
However, like great citizen rights and anti-craft movements in front of us, we will be successful because we are more powerful.

U.S. President Donald Trops on Wednesday reported the largest Chinese Dinnic Days Register's pad supplement on China's constitution on 6 November.
Trump's charge was that Beijing is trying to force the U.S. officials to say a new attempt to pressure China.
This is a normal event that the foreign government will announce for the spread of trade, but the biijing and Washington are now sent to the commercial war, which increases the number of survival in importing one another.

Desert Island Disk: Tom Deli has been "indescribable" because of sexuality.
Olympic Diver Tom Deli says he suffers indecisiveness at the age of adulthood, but it is a success.
This 24-year-old said he didn't go to the media school before he realized that he wasn't like me.
When he spoke to the first radio 4 December Island, Larne Lauren Vallaron, he explained that he spoke of the social rights of others to give the "correct" of others.
He adds that after the child's birth, the psychological victory has been lost.
The administration of this long-time event has taken a few months for the sake of the cristi Yong disease.
At the first meeting in Vallarin, Deli said that he felt "too" more than the rest of the people, because "he was not a socially acceptable to me."
He says: "Today, the youngness of the feeling and emotion has been real to me that the strength and strength that I have made to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove himself as "one" so that everyone would know about his sexuality so that everyone would not despair.
Broadcasting the Broadcaster in the two bars of Olympic has become the hyphebiti advocates and has worked on his presence to appeal to more countries in Australia to accept the unity of the same year.
He said he was opening his mouth, because he thought he was lucky and wanted to be "awaiting" to others.
This three-third world champion tells a man's love-American film designer Dustein Lans Black, with whom he was shown in 2013 - "We were surprised."

He said, "If I asked me last year, I would say, 'I have to win a Golden Medell.' That's what I had to do with my mind.
"Truly, there are more than the olympics.
Ruby is my Olympic surveiller."
His son's name is Robert, who died 40 years old at the cancer of the Massics in 2011.
Deli says that his father never confessed that he was dying, and he finally asked whether their ticket was confirmed for London 2012 because he wanted to remain in the first row.
"I can't say, 'You're no longer going to be in the first row,' he says.
"I took his hand while his breath stopped, and he left the last night and died, and I didn't confess that he was unconscious."
The following year, Deli will join the Olympic and win the Brondak.
He said, "It was my whole life dream of being devoting to the opposing viewers, it doesn't seem better than this."
It also prompted his first song - the Proud of Hidar Smul, which was sent with the Olympics in preparation and still cut off his shoulders.

The new war in Germany is repudiated.
According to local news reports, German Nevi, the newest group in the year 2014, was to be launched to reorganize the war of the former cold war.

The reason behind the return is very short, but German media mentions a number of important "softwear and hardware errors" that will emit the ship in the war.
The softweights are especially important, since Baden-Wortemberg's ships will be guided by the cross of Nabie, which is half of the old Bremen team's freaks.
Also, it was seen that the ship would be a surgeon that would disrupt the power of the ship and create obstacles for the future of the ship.

Brexit: Lost as a car preparer, UK will be ‘black for a long time'
The Indian Minister Greg Clarke says that the first time he'll be the first to make the car after the braxit, the U.S. is to be the first "blacks" of the United States in Haralay.
He adds that it's "drifty" that the United States Toota BBC said that if Briton Eu, without any agreement, they would quickly stop their products in Burbury in their factory.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark says.
This Japanese car builder said that if the brexit in a non-profit agreement, people could go to work because of the infrastructure of the country.
Bernston's Karatti, which created Toota Oris and Evans, produced about 150,000 cars that last year were exported to 90 percent of the European Union.
In Bernstein, Tooter Managing Director Marvin Cook says, "My opinion is that if the Britan E has been evicted from March at the end of the time, we can stop the products in our room."
Other vehicles with Honda, B. D.D. and Zaguer Land Rover have been concerned about how the UK will be handled without the European Union.
For example, BM DBLU said they would stop their Mini Plant in Oxford in a month after the bridge.
The main concerns of the car builders are the threat of Sapli Chain for non-communications.
Tooter production lines run on "Jest-in-time", each in 37 minutes from the car and the U and the U.S. providers.
If it leaves without any agreement on March 29, the U.S. controversy can cause aggression in the borders, causing the intervention to be delayed, and the intervention is like a constitutional moth.
The organization said that Tooter Dubishian Plant cannot keep more than one day in the amount of investment, which could stop products.
Mr. Clark says that in the future, it's a plan to deal with Tharesa Mer Checkers to avoid such checks.
"We need a deal. We want to do the best that we can do, not just keep it successful, but also enjoy the prospects of future improvement, saying in the BBC radio 4 at today's event.
"Not the cell too, but the other productors have the evidence that there is more to continue the success of the saply channel."
It's impossible to say how long the product will be stopped, but they are concerned that long enough money will lose the potential for the factory and that it can leave a lot of jobs.
