Listen to a little bit.
Can you be sure?
He's less than me.
I don't speak Japanese.
We're both right.
Tom slept out.
Sit down.
Don't worry about me.
It's cool.

You should ask him for advice.
I'll take him.
I'm cold.
I'm sorry.
I'm still your friend.
I can't believe that I believed Tom.
Careful.
My son can't swallow yet.
Take the car to see you.
I eat.
I don't want to go alone.
How far from the station?
He was sick last week.

We're trying once!
Tom tired.
Don't forget about us.
Tom kept talking.
I'm south of the north.
I'm so tired to see you.

There's a cup on the table.
I'll be back in an hour.
I have to get off this ship.
That's Tom.
He's not here yet.
Kim slowly laughed.
I'm not in the city.
Women bring the world's changes.
Just a little bit.
I don't want Tom to see me here.
Tom started to scream.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
It's worth 300.
Start here.
We were waiting for them.
My yellow color.
Tom made sure to keep a diary.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I'm not your friend.
How old is he?
Come back.
Why are you screaming?
Can I get a check?
Do you have something bigger?
Tom's coming twice from me.
It's my need.
I think you don't need any help.
Tom waited out of the gate.
Don't wait.
Is the magic open today?
Don't wait.
Don't worry about my business.

You're very good from me.
He's not here yet.
I can't open my right hand.
I'm in the hospital.
Tom got the thief.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
Do you understand me?
When Tom heard that Mary Rye had married, she was surprised to see him.
Success depends on effort in most cases.
Tom's so funny.
Tom's headed.
Did you get born there?
All know it now.
I got my shoes.
I was surprised.
Are you on the move?
What's the curtain?
Contact disconnected.
Can I get a wheel?
Have you ever broken the bones?
I want to name the next step.
How are you?

Have you ever run a horse?
He was talking.

What's this about you?
I didn't have to say anything to Tom.
Try more.

Why are you sitting there?
What language is spoken in the United States?
I'm tired.
He has two girls.
I want you to talk to Tom.
I'm your friends.
Follow Tom.
Tom always keeps his word.
He's an expert teacher.

We're lost.
Do you have your car?
Stop Tom.

Did you call?
They all shouted.
You go first.
Whatever, if the rain stops, we'll probably get out.
Calm down.
You should ask him for advice.
I tried.
Who are you?

Everybody saw it.
It's good to be no more.
He sleeps like the kids.
Who are they?
What do I mean, you understand?
Can you speak slowly, please?
It's still mine.
Don't come.
Tom, you can't get it.
Tom's bad.
You can choose what you want.
Tom helped me.
Leave him.
Wait here.
How long did the Shatal bus spend the airport?
Stay home.
Tell me what you want.
I don't know if it's time to do it.
Tom keeps his point.
I want you to call Tom.
Tom bought something.
Tom's gone.
You go first.
We've eaten all night.
Esq will start tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
What's it down?
Football is a game.
The sky is clear.
Namscale!
I'm really doing your generosity.
He told me he'd go to Venice.
What's your phone number?
He walks.
What does this symbol mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Wait here.
Have I done a little too late?
Leave him.
I can't say the right thing.
The language is a holo communication media.
Tom knows that.
I've never heard Tom.
When's the next train for Tokyo?
Tom's taking a big risk.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Are you going to America in the next month?
I don't want to go to the cold.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He's not here yet.
I'm sorry!
You want to tell me how much you want to say.
The snow represents the ice cream.
Come out.
They shouted.
I ran home.
We made a pancake for the nightmare.
You don't have a bicycle?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're screaming.
He's open.
He doesn't want to talk about this.
Everybody saw it.
I'll give my kid to eat in the morning and in the morning.
My son came to my house.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have the password?
Please give me my sympathy.
Do what he says.
I'm so tired to see you.
Tom started shouting.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always keeps his word.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We've seen them.
Today, June 18, and today's Muriel's birthday.
Who won?
Let's get ready.
We're gonna have to tell the empty tom to do this for us, right?
Can these be found in a stable condition?
I'm going to Osaka station.
I don't think Tom's responsible for it.
Someone's open.
I'm in the bank.
I learned to live without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Just a moment.
Tom was busy with work.
I'm not proud of the way I used.
I'm scared.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm staring.
I'm not doing the right thing.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is this Tom's book?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could've died.
Are you sure?
Let's go now.
He's sneaking in his mind.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
It's easy to breathe his head.
And wherever he is, he's followed by his dog.
Who is this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
My grandfather's taking the old bottle.
I like the number.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus stop?
What does that mean?
You don't have a bicycle?
You want to come?
My mom can play a lot of sweets.
He knows where we are.
I know your name.
Tom isn't here.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped screaming.
How old is Tom?
Come on!
Stop tea.
Tom was there?
I've paid blood tonight.
I'm still in trouble.
Where's Tom?
It seems American to see them.
You were the only friend of Tom.
I went to the hospital.
I've accepted her invitation.
My father can drive a very good car.
I'll be alone.
You need your friend.
Forget tom.
I think Tom said he was his grandfather Jackson.
You've known Tom for a long time from me.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My bag hasn't reached yet.
Tom wasn't here yet.
Please wait until he comes.
Tom keeps his word a little bit.
There's something down.
Is there someone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's good.
Where will I get the stamp?
I'm going to tea.
Can he speak French?
Tom would like to take it.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
Don't you take a little more?
It's gone one day.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friends.
Hit that woman.
How old is that Church?
Ask me tomorrow, Coro.
It's still mine.
Where am I going to claim my bags?
We do what we want.
Tommy's right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for all students whose native language is not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be a minister.
Who will you trust?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I had to do.
Nobody's insignificant.
Are you here?
The rest are laughing.
How many nights will you stay?
Have you seen the people in this picture?
I lost my bags.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake up to Tom.
My son's getting financially involved.
It looks like snow can start tonight.
How much would it cost?
You know what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I want to be happy with Tom.
You shouldn't cut down the rocks of those who live in the woods.
Why are you shouting?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to the hospital.
Tom wants his shadow back.
Tom is at home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'm fucking drunk.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city divided a river and a west.
Look at yourself.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have your car?
Tomo singer.
Do you think you can do anything now?
He's launching now.
Can you keep watch on the Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This teeth are breaking.
How much do these flowers do?
How much more do you need to pay?
Everyone loved Tom.
What happened here?
Take your keys.
Are you Japanese?
Just a little bit.
Eat whatever you like.
Take it.
Have you ever broken the bones?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't move my right foot.
I'm smart.
How old are you?
Can I ask a question?
What is that?
Take your keys.
We've seen more bad things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What is that?
He's eating.
He likes garage.
You don't understand.
My mother's getting mad.
Sit at the table.
He's less than me.
What is your name?
We were waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use the credit card?
It's very big night, isn't it?
This book is found only in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I pay the credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went home to Jackson.
He had a black tape.
Anything else?
Everyone's staring.
Is there any escape for the students?
I'm eating Noodlos.
Tom's in the house.
Ask them how they're doing.
Will you come in?
I mean.
We like football game.
What are you eating?
Good evening.
He's empty.
They want new sukts for these shoes.
Everyone loved Tom.
Who is that?
I'm still your friends.
Rejoice.
Please listen!
He's running.
I'll go to the cold, even if it rains tomorrow.
My right arm is stinging.
My father was busy.
Everyone's ready to go.
I couldn't catch the train at 7:00 a.m.
He had two daughters.
It's my wife.
Let's do a story.
You got a pen?
It's not going to start a class before eight years.
You're gonna have to run a long time like that?
What does that word mean?
How much do I get?
Can you say English?
What they did was wrong.
My son is long from me.
Tom was my parents.
Here's your business.
Tom's alive.
She's showing her in the facility.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is that worth?
You can eat as much as you want.
Let's go.
I'm just a little burning.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Finish it.
How old are you?
Take Tom.
They woke up.
You're shouting.
I don't think it will rain tomorrow.
I'll come back when I'm over.
I like the light.
He's grown in France.
He didn't work at Sunday.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
The Teroans were killed.
It's nothing but its fruit.
Tom's father is a sourker.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
It's a time.
I'm never mistaken.
Where's the door in the UA11?
I'm in the kitchen.
Why are you staring?
Tom wants his shadow back.
You usually go to bed when?
The country composed a agreement between both themselves.
I'm talking to Tom in a free French language.
Tom beat his eyes.
Can you give it a little gift?
Tom, now in the car.
You forgot what?
I don't really want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's laughing.
He's not here yet.
It's not mine.
Who's here?
He's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The terrorists left the captives.
I could go with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my human.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government's advocates.
Get out of town!
Gun to Tires.
She's looking for him.
How old was that church?
Let's go!
You can say Japanese.
Did you see her go away?
How much did Shatal bus cover the airport?
Don't fight.
It's mine.
That's my bag.
I have an old computer that I don't need any more.
I've got Tetha.
We were on our feet.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom was screaming.
Tom's very low.
Take whatever you want.
Tom's crying.
How much is that worth?
I'm good.
They're a doctor.
The plane's up to the right time.
I don't know what you're trying to explain.
Most of the spectators were business.
Rotate right.
Tom's sleeping.
I've got a lot of shit.
Tom's running a lot.
He knows where we are.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Tom smoked.
Everyone was screaming.
I'll be out.
My mom can sleep well.
They're staring.
The research was successful.
I think the gold that Tom received is little to be given to him.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17.
Here you go.
Leave Tom.
Take your double.
Our name is Tom.
They were all happy.
Is that your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who breaks the flower?
Tom's wounded.
Follow the Tom.
Tom's still angry with me?
Tom's gone.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not down.
Do you know what he said?
Listen to me.
We made a lot of mistake.
Why are you screaming?
What is your fatherâ€™s name?
Look at that.
I'll tell you if you do something.
We tried.
Tom retired in October.
The market is near the doctor.
Good Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What is the meaning of the sign?
Tom's headed.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's blue Anners.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen to me.
Will you go to buy me?
Come on.
They're there.
I'll tea.
Everyone's smart.
Don't let me sleep.
Who was he?
I'm Lajuk.
When I said that Mary left the city, I was really surprised to see Tom.
I heard a scream.
When's your plane?
Uni doesn't want to talk about this.
My book seemed to be interesting.
Tell me what happened.
I've got eight o'clock today.
Please fire the light.
Tom hurt.
I'm still your friends.
I took more than two hours to translate a few pages.
Are they yours?
Who is he?
Is this the little way to go to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
Are you sure you know him?
It's impossible!
When did the train reach Yokohama?
How old is it?
The words will not correct the right words, and you can make more common translations instead.
Your shoes are here.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to cry for you.
Listen, is this train going to the Washington Scorchor?
We've failed.
There's AC in this house.
Did you get the whole thing?
Tom was at Boston.
Clean it up.
Don't open that.
Tom saw him.
The evenings can pass the snow.
I'm not proud of that.
There's someone there?
It's wrong.
I'm no longer young.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Will you get fish with us?
Just wait here.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
One minute.
Tom was wounded.
Mary explained.
I'm not denying it.
Don't see!
Donâ€™t be quick to end as soon as possible.
Use it.
When did the train reach Yokohama?
I don't understand that.
I've got seven o'clock in the morning.
I'm at home.
Run fast.
Good day!
I got inside.
Me too.
I'm not too busy.
That's great.
Do it again!
Tom started in the sky.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "I don't want to go."
I know that.
I'll be close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
I'm wearing my feet.
Ask Tom.
I'm thinking what I'll give you in the birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Nice to see you again.
Why are you screaming?
Stay right there.
Cut the food you like.
We played the park.
I'm busy.
Can I buy tickets from where?
I've finished my job.
I'm planning to stay in the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started to scream.
I don't argue.
Can you read it?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom happy.
Don't get in.
We're lost.
Tom's cheating.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm looking empty, thank you.
Unfortunately this is true.
We were waiting for them.
How many years do I see?
Tom's not happy here.
It was angry.
I don't like to eat my coffee.
Speak more quickly.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to meet Tom?
Here you go.
We don't buy it out of him.
I called my good friend Tom.
We'll never play better than it.
We're Lajuk.
The bill will be given to the meeting today.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's not right.
Cut whatever you like.
I have the Wins.
Why did you cry to Tom?
