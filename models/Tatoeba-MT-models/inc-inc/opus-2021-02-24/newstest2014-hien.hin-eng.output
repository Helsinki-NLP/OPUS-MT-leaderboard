Black box in your car?
While the road planners in the United States are fighting with the loss of money to improve the highway system, many people are looking at its solution in the blackbox, which fits with your car's dashboard.
The device that tracks each mill run by motor- driver and directs the information to the authorities, has become an integral issue of advisable effort to rebuild the old system of America's main streets.
Usually, like Hawaii Niogen, the work has suddenly become an issue of deep debate and living controversies.
To have details about the location you drived - and then use this information to create a tax bill - the Liberian environmental groups have joined the support to allow the government to use these black boxes.
The cheese party is smart.
The U.S. citizen freedom organization also is very concerned with various secrets of various types.
While Congress could not agree whether to proceed or not, many are not waiting for the Kingdom.
They're looking for ways to go to a system that they can pay for every mill set on the street in the next decade.
Thousands of motor players have already taken the black box for test drives, including some of the GPS monitoring.
It's really an essential thing for our country.
"It's not a topic to be selected by us," says Han Ikhrata, who is working directors of the South California State Union, which is planning to start each milled by motor-players in California for the year 2025.
We're going to change the way to pay taxes.
It's technology to do that.
This is the main reason for the country's Highway Trast Fund has become almost Divalia, which is paid by the taxes that the American citizens pay on gas pomp.
U.S. people don't buy as much gas as they can now.
Now a gallons in a gallon gas runs more mile than before.
Federal Tex has no increase in the past 20 years, which is 184 cents gallon.
Because of gas's high value, the politicians avoid making a lot of money in taxes.
In Minnesota University, transmission policy expert Le Munich says, "It's not uncommon to go."
Their government has recently set up the tracking device in 500 cars to test the anti-milk payment system.
They say, "This will work as the most reasonable option in a time."
Vanx calls it a millage-based user splash.
It isn't surprising that this idea seems to be interesting to the citizens, for example, to change taxes to perform car-tracks, which can help reduce the jam and minimize the gas.
California's planners are eager for this system while they are developing tactics to accomplish their goal in the state's High Commissioner Global Warming Rules.
But the president of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Suster (A.P.A.), also considers the most practical option of the black box.
Free sales in the Regen Foundation are on the side of each mill payment by the driver.
"It's not just what it's going to go into the blind corner," said Adrian Mur in Regene.
People are paying more clearly for what they get.
The campaign has also supported two U.S. Environment secretors who had been favored by the Congress in 2011 to advance to the congress.
U.S. Senate accepted a test project of 90-millian dollars last year, including 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of the rural systems, those who were represented by those who had to go to the daily work or go to the city, the leader of Zadan ended the proposal there.
Still, many kingdoms and cities are going up in this direction themselves.
It is the most willing Oregon, which lists 5,000 drivers in the largest use of the country.
These drivers will soon pay for the freezing elevator rather than gas.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving forward in this direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on limited base.
And I-95 conference, including the 17 Kingdom transportation departments (with Meriland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are studying how they can perform this change.
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nevada, where this device was put on the cars of 50 volunteer car drivers a while ago, the drivers were too slow to think that the government could monitor each step.
OUDAN Khan, who directs the genetic and functional management in the Nwada Traveling Department, says, "Bug Brother and other things of the same kind were a major problem."
It's not what people wanted.
As with testing, the Nwada's ACLU warned on your website: "It will be very easy to convert these devices into the entire tracking device."
There is no need for developing a huge, uninvited technology format, which must be spreaded in order to keep every person's daily-known record.
Nevada is among the many kingdoms that are trying to get the best technology, which can help the kingdom to figure out how many miles the car is running every day, but it is not where she is and when she is going.
Khan said if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The discovery of this technology led some state agencies to the small California start-up.
This form was not originally in the business to help the drivers to rule.
It was trying to enter the market standing on the Oto Bema, where drivers were to pay on their mille.
But the device which this is testing seems to be nice to the highway planners, because it does not use GPS and provides a lot of limited information, which is uploaded by modem at a certain interval.
"If you don't track people's speed and their position, they'll be more inclined to follow this way."
These early programs of the Kingdom have some serious mistakes.
There are too few costs and low intervention methods to do this.
In Oregon, the plane drivers are using different different options.
They may choose a device of GPS or non-GPS.
Or don't choose any other device, but set it up on average by the people's means of transportation.
Other places hope that this can be sold by the worrying citizens instead of giving more subsistence in the device.
In New York City, traveling officers are trying to develop a taxing device, which also allows paying parking meters to free, "separate according to your drive", and make a collection of real time data from other drivers that can use motor-players to avoid traffic.
The city administration document mentions, "Motor-player will be drawn to share in the benefit of it."
However, some transport planners wonder that the discussions on the paying is perhaps a great surprise.
The Metropolitan transportation agency in San Francisco is said that the Congress gas tax can easily be solved with the problem of Divalia Highway Trast Fund.
The hybrid or other car drivers may also be set up one-time or a year-time holiday so that they do not use too much gas to pay their proper share.
The director of the Agency and public affairs, Randy Rentsheller, said, "What is required when Esperin can work with the Apochal surgery?"
If we do, millions of car drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he's been dying.
However, his friend has been arrested by the police on the charge of hiding the luxuries with him.
The police have delivered the final report of death in court.
It seems that on August 26, the police blew the body of the witch Eakbal, who lived in the footshake garden in the Zazm River.

Ruth also dwells in the garden of Persia, and he was a friend of the wise.
Ruhail went to Namaz-A-jumma after he went to Saum.
The fool opened his clothes, and put all the stuff on the side, and went to the other side to drink.
When he came back, the ignorant wasn't there, he had only clothes.
Ruhale searched for the witch, but he didn't find it.
So he took his mobile phone, clock, and other stuff to use.
He didn't tell anyone that the fool was drowning.
The police told the court that the excitement was due to drowning, and it was confirmed in postmartum.
However, Ruhal was taken to Hierapolis under 404 to hide the treasures of the facts and the dead.

Sno Den is ready to "support" with the German on the U.S. चौक.
Edward Snow Day, U.S. Chifia Mumber, declared that Berlin is ready to travel to prove the constitution in Germany if the United States's National Security Agency and his officials fail to answer their activities.
The German M.P. Hans Cristian Stroe Belle visited Mr. Sno Den Seguar in Russia, where he has been given refuge to talk about the witness in Germany.
On Friday, Sand presented a letter presented by Mr. Snow Den in the media in Berlin, saying: "But my efforts are positively positive, my government believes in unconsciousness as a group, and no escapes that try to criminal political talk with the charges of the Gundagardi."
However, speaking the truth isn't a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dan said they believed he could rule the American government to release the support of the international community against them.
The U.S. justice department includes the verdict of secrets and stealing from the government's property.
Hans Peter Frederick, a member of the German internal affairs, told the online Zeit: "Sir is ready to talk to the German authorities, so we're going to find a way to make it possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany has become under pressure because NSA has claimed that NSA has called a phone call on the Chanceller Angela Marquelle.
Thomas Operman, who is head of the Communist Committee, cares about survival information. He said that if Mr. Snow Den Cosunna had the opportunity to evaluate the relationships with the Americans and not bring them in danger, it should also be taken.
Mrs. Belle, a Sand of the Green Party of Germany, published a photo with Mr. Sno Den on Twitter Feed.
He said he was on his journey to Russia with two German journalists.
Sristo Belle said that, according to the former NSA lawyer, if they left Russia, they were not able to return to Russia.
If Sno Den is witnessing in the Netherlands, he'll be safe there, which needs assurances.
Mr. Snow Den said in his letter that they had to leave home.
Although he said they were happy and welcomed by global evangelizing "to their work of political expressions."
The United States, along with the U.S. citizens, also the high officials, have come to a supervisor of an unemployed system of public service.
The letter extends a proposal to support the German authorities "when human situation is solved."
Frontier Airlines Carrie - On Bage
Frontier Airlines is planning to borrow $100 to store the carrier-ons for passengers on his plane board.
In Frontier Airlines, there is a plan to start a loan for $100 for a carrier - on bag, and it'll set $2 for coffee or soda, although on Wednesday, it announced that passengers can keep the whole bubble.
The new carrier - on free for the bag in the overhead ben, so the small bag under the seat will still be cleaned.
Frontier said that $25 will charge if paid in advans, $100 has to wait if the travelers wait until they're on the gate.
Frontier Prime Minister Kate O 'Mali said that $100 is to get the charge in the Adventure of $25 passengers.
"We don't want him to charge," he said.
Airlines started charges for the first and second test bag in 2008.
The travelers who are trying to evacuate from the jungle are doing as much as they can in Carrie - On Bage, which is in the overhead Debbe, means most of the space in this dubby.
One way to reduce passengers on the sluggish board.
Oh 'Mali said it's not really about getting a new loan.
It's for the most loyal clients about Frontier that it's hard to find the place of overhead Bin.
It doesn't have to give passengers who buy tickets in their website.
That's the reason that the next person in the line may have to give 100 dollars for the same bag, while a traveler on a front gate can get a bag, a bank.
O 'Mali said Frontier's website and checks are being changed before they get the ball.
Frontier’s new carrier - on fifteen will not start until summer, although a date has not been determined.
The passengers often express dissatisfiedness about the baggage and other slopes, but the plane service loves them.
They argue that money is spent to manage the bag, and those who want to serve should pay for it.
On Wall Street, the fifteen is watching as a signal that many Airlines are earning enough money to cover the airport costs after years.
The majority of the carrier - on bags are not sluggish.
Spirit Airlines Inc. The Carrie - On Sullk began the first three years, and after the disposer Allegiant Air.
With such a slope, another Air of airline Hungary is the Wiz Air, who says the Airline counselor J. Sorensen, and who tracks the AD - On Fice.
He said that the carrier of the Spirit - On Smoking brings $50 million in a year that was estimated in December 2011.
Sorenson, a former president of Midwest Airlines, recently headed in the Spirit, and the passengers had to face the carrier - on an unusual bag on the gate.
"The boarding process I saw was easy in my Airline career," he said.
I had hoped to see the dentist and a war gate out.
"The plane was full and he said it was lickty-split.
Frontier too is following the $2 of the Spirit for coffee, tea, or juice.
Frontier Goodah that the traveler who left, or the juice can keep the whole box, and it will give it free coffee only for one time.
It'll still take away the water.
In 2008, U.S. Airways tried to charge medications, but seven months later after the complaint of the passengers, they turned back and followed after any other major Airline.
If Frontier's travelers don't buy directly from Airline, this step is their new attempt to manage clients on their own website.
Airlines pays on online traffic vendor Orbitz for $10 to sell each $25.
That's why all Airlines have been encouraged to direct the passengers to go through an online transport agent rather than buy them directly.
Frontier, however, has gone forward in this field.
In September, most of the flight took half a distance to the clients who bought an online train agent from these people.
On Wednesday, it subdued to 25 percent of Trip Millez Award.
So, an online transport agent will regulate a 1000 miles [1,000 m] of Frontier Trip 250 miles [250 m].
It also allows them to choose their seats in the forest when they buy the Frontier website directly.
In Frontier's Denver, there's a loyal base of clients in his home city, but its business is getting low and it's losing money.
The 9 percent of the population and its flying capacity has decreased about 13 percent in the first stem, according to the interventional results by the Corporate Parent Republic Republic Airways Holings Ink.
The Republic Airline is trying to determine Frontier's price as part of the sales.
NSA accused the "internal error" instead of the hackers to crash the website
The secret national security agency told Friday that our website was closed for some hours, not because of the hackers, as some people claimed online.
"NSA.gov didn't reach this night for several hours, which had been the internal error of an unspecified update."
This problem will be solved tonight.
This claim is not true that it came with the attack of D.O.S., the distribution of service.
In the evening, the online server trackers found that the website of NSA was closed for at least six hours, and the sites for some users are not yet available.
NSA's advocate said to the ABC News that the Agency's internal, sensitive network was "never "tolerant".
The proposal said no classified information is in danger.
At least a hectic group claims they are responsible for banning the DDOOS website by attack.
DDOOS attack is designed to send more traffic on the target website until the server is overloaded.
This cyber strategy is inexpensive and does not have the purpose of attacks to identify the internal network of target system.
The former secret NSA, which had been named "No Agency", has become a subject of discussions and rumoration between the people in the past months since the events of the foreign and homeliest news programs have occurred - the former UNA.S. secreted by E.N.A. and the secretary after the Agency has been stolen from the Agency and secrets.
Because of such increasing debates about Agnes, such speculations were made after the night event, that the event was the result of the target cyber operation.
Beautiful expressions were presented in the devastating era and today's conditions, according to the story of 'one and another treachery'.
It was shown in which bars of today's parliament are bound to go on the wrong path.
The Nativity St. Joseph Inter College's chief guest Prime Minister, Valmiki, the president of the camp camp, Narash Console, and power lions unitedly did.
The drama was depicted as the treachery of the Deaper Era and the economy of a professor Arwind.
Anal Sharma in the directive Native drama, India's pollution shame, Ainal Sharma, Winnod Breen, Hemnt Goal, Seamor, Chuturwedi, Avid Sami, Shiva Gazala, Amath, Remesh, Argentin, has a great presentation with the farmers.
The light system in the Nativity was a young man who was a dynamic worker, C. and the design of the Kingdom and set.
Its suburbs were given a variety of awards from journalists, culturally contributing to the Association.
It was followed by the Urdu Deputy of the lion Wivi, Dr. Fairma Jakhsheedpuri, Rajvanth Shukla, and a colored worker of C.
Secretary Sundra Sharma, Rakesh Kosich, Abid Rizvi, was involved in the workmate's succession.
As the plane deliver, the bombardier's diplomatic ventilation in order to defy the orders.
The airplane and train Macer Bombardier Inc reported 15 percent of the railway in pure profits on Thursday, as a third of his railway unit, and as less air command and pressure on the constitutional issues.
Montrial-based Bombardier also did not offer up a update to his new CSE plane to go to the plane or to the plane from September to the airport.
About half a month before the first test air flight, it's just been flying three times, the question arises whether the test step is on the track.
The result was lower than the preview and sent over 8 percent to slide in the Shear Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameroon Dorson, analyst Share with the National Bank Finnchial, subtracted his rating from Thursday to "Stack" for the "field display" on Thursday. Stack is above the next one or two tissue.
"Kamjoar was expecting more than the airplane delivery, we clearly despaired of the majin display in the transport, "Dorcen said in a client note."
We'll get a new command for Bombardier CSEries as progress as a test program.
However, if no new commands are being declared in the coming months, the market program will be shocked.
Bombardier expects the plane family now can cut it off at the end of the market of Boiing and Airbads.
The first test was uncovered in March, and the first flight was for the first time in September after the delay.
Probably the Crete waits for the result of the investigation of the company's demands about the new jetlinear fuel and the potential cost savings, but as between 177 and CSeries, it's the middle of the middle order.
403 is available with the clients and the operators.
Main activist Pierre Boodine believed that the jet will complete his 300 forest orders since Bombardier was brought into use.
The authorities assured the researchers and the Thursday media that the program was running according to the list.
"Testary plane was on the ground for long-expected level," said Bodine in a conference call, was determined during the intervention of the land test and the software update plane.
Every designer creates a different way.
We've decided to make a first flight and to make a update period and said what we've done.
That's all will be through the flying program.
With the following following five test planes, the rest of the plane will be expected to fly in the coming weeks, the company said.
Still, scientists believe that clients can start a CSERE plane in the first 12 months of their flight.
Bombardier said it was appreciated for the services in the entry and would provide an update in the next few months.
"It's a slow speed - but with the inside list of Bombardier - in the line - our idea that services in the entry will be collapsed in Q1/15." Dorisen said.
To the end of September 30, the clean profit of Bombardier fell to $147 Millenn, or to $172 Million, or to each share, or to the 9 cent.

Koken's Adhi lawyer's secret information about the police test, Mr. Big.
42-year-old bastard warned the famous criminal Niel Scarboro
The authorities felt that people could find out about his secret medication
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Leverpoll Crown Court
The top lawyer of the rescue party, who told Mr. Bigg about the major police test, because he was afraid people would know about his secret drug, three years old.
After the 42-year-old deta compromised his cocaine's habit, the famous criminal Niel Scarboro gave sensitive information about the testing of his new medication activities.
The prosecutor, who was named "Bash", was praised as "Top Briff", was arrested from his home in 2011 after police in Scarboro, which he represented in the former Norkotics truck.
The authorities saw 32-year-old Scarboro holding three bags of cocaine in the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lakshair, while he was out with his cocken, while he went to the Lossaiti Dinor.
After receiving the cocaine's hair, his salary, and his credit card, it was discovered that Date A's Native drugs were the "independent user".
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to get information illegally about the arrest of two people from Scarboro and his colleagues.
Lakashire, Kumberia, Merceside, Burxier, and West Yorkshire were then under charge by the police as part of the main test of Heroin and Kochen team.
There were 32 other people who were sent to prison after the over 200,000 pounds of Hiroin and Cokeen during the number of printing by the police.
And the 42-year-old ditta told the criminals, because he feared that the people would not know his lewdness.
The situation in Blackbond was now facing a discouraging situation in the forest for forests, going to three weeks at the Liverpool Crown court after the road was convicted by the Leverpal Crown court.
He accepted about keeping Cokeen in the previous hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer began when the police found out he was regularly contacted with Deta from February 2011.
Two spies followed the surgeon and saw it coming to the house of Dutta, and with more than 60 percent of the vaccine in the Black Golf Glove.
After the drugs had been put, Scarboro was regularly contacted by the phone, which went out for Dinner in Blakarn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer came home, he found that there was drugs there, and there were nine conversations between them.
It was heard in court that when the survival of a classic drugs was found on the hairs, bute and credit cards, he was found in the test of Kochen's "standing user".
Duta was later arrested, but he refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to the vegetarian dealer, because he was his client and said he was the subject of his discussion of the "practical Privileges".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove a lot of credit cards, but they had been taken, and his hair had been modeled.
In the police interview he said he was driving his office along with his workplace, and his clients were calling on his home for procedures.
After explaining what the spies knew about them, the court said that DTA drugs were called to the chiefs of the hospitals, some of whom he presented the case before.
Annie White from the administration party said: "You should know the best about not breaking the law."
Mr. Dutta has been accused to misuse his position as the official, to connect to your special client.
We're not talking about the common drug dealer, but about a dealer who's giving his lawyer a drug.
Some of their conversations must have been without doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limit of the lawyer-Client relationship.
As much as he could, he restricted the test of the police so that they could be able to continue their armed activities.
Mr. Deta was not honoring his career, but degrading.
He made a lot of diplomatics from certain clients, especially from Scarboro, and he allowed his freedom of choice.
Deta denied any wrong job and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I'm not, and if I wanted to inform Mr Scarboro, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.
But after hearing the hearing, the superintendent of the Lucashi Police Le Helsteed said: "Smy Dyta started to obtain drugs with organized criminals, they changed themselves to a crime official."
Because of their cocaine's habits, they made a lot of compromises and became very weak to the future members of the crime group, who used it to get important information related to police test.
Governors must have the highest standard of faithfulness, and should have faith and confidence among men.
Mr. Ditta has deceived this faith and tried to avoid his career.
Sri Lankashire's serious and organized crime unit tested Mr. Dutta, which also found him guilty of three cases of cocaine and now banning the way of justice, which demonstrates our refusal to bring the criminals into court.
The case should be a warning to the criminals that no one is far away from the law.
We'll find you and present you to the court.
Scarboro was sentenced to 14 years after he was found guilty of conspiracy against Hiroin, Kochen and Bang.
The 50 other members of the group were sent to prison for the total 153 years for drug crimes.
Duta on his website asked and replied sessions about himself, where he said that his fancy job would be a lawyer for the death sentence client in the United States, to be his deanor guest and incomprehensible to his work.

According to a survey published by the Claude Security Allens, some 10 percent of the American members of the U.S. people were planning to use an American-based client after exploding on the data Prizem Khan program.
"We saw a new question that didn't come to the clients a year ago -- that's where my data is stored? And can you guarantee that it will be physically in that area?"
Many German authorities have reasoned that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: the powerful governments want to steal their most precious secrets and data and so should be watched on them.
That's not a surprise.
It's always happened.
"It's a subject for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing changed." Kate Bock, the chemical maker of BASF, is called the main activist of BASF.
American genetic and industrial levels are on us, and we do, because it's national advantage to save our business.
Corporate leaders are usually not interested in security and are a benefit to the attacker.
For the big company, there's been a record for a long time, even though it's unthinkable to leave a home business with usb stick, or a laptop venture to leave in a hotel room to say at least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, members of the car builder Oddy, the board, says that it's an old system to collect mobile phones before the board's meetings because they can't use them as remote listen tools.
The BfV activists in Germany, while smart phones are compromised because of dangers on foreign times, suggesting to think about using a simple prepad mobile.
Prepeed mobile phones were later thrown.
However, the small and middle companies are in danger of hacking and overseeing it is a concern.
In Germany, it's a lot of company in the global market.
"The small and middle size comnia often warns to protect the corporate secrets in a report of the lack of experience, industrial and economic inequality," BFV warns in a report.
The United States warns of the economic spies of their own company by other countries.
According to France The Washington Post, the American National Cupia in Ferviary is named after Russia and Israel, behind China, after the economic news, in another territories connected to Hacking.
According to a German blue chip member of the board, when things come to make financial notice, "France is the worst.

American genetic and industrial levels are on us, and we do, because it's national advantage to save our business.
No one was fooled.
The parents of Georgia's teenage girl in 'another accident' believe her son was killed.
A young girl in Georgia who had been buried in her high school gym, who believed that her son was killed, said to Guararar.
Valdosta, G.K. Kennedrick Johnson, was found on the side of his high school gym on January 11.
The researchers of London County Sheriff concluded that Johnson had died in a 'unfortunate accident', but the family of the 17-year-old boy refused.
"They're absolutely sure that their son has been murdered."
They don't even trust in death in the way Sheriff told them.
Cramp said, "They believe it's different from the physical law and the logic of general wisdom."
They think this conclusion is an excuse to protect the person or the people for his son's death.
He said, "They sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned in a body bag."
U.S. President Michael Correy said to Guru that he was being an official investigation of Johnson's death, seeing that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the reason for death?
Was he murdered because of a crime?
Murray said these things on Thursday afternoon at a journalist assembly.
I will follow the facts. They will lead us wherever they go.
My purpose is to bring the truth in front of me.
He said, “I think there are environmental reasons to test.”
Moore told the reporter that in the interior test, the death of Johnson was the result of the "social wildlife".
According to the Moore, there was a different cause of death in a second test.
They said, "There are a number of questions that should be answered, or whether they should be of those who are certain."
Moore also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to find a criminal in the death of Johnson or to test the citizen rights, he would say to the FBI.
The delegates were not immediately available for comments from Londonh County Sheriff's office when contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the judge of South Georgia ordered the executives to launch all the oversight videos that were reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope they'll get some signals from the video footage about how he died.
CDC issued a child's algebraic algebraic-directional direction for students
On Wednesday, the disease controls and blockatheam Center launched directions to control children's food algebrary in school.
The first time the U.S. government has issued such directions, since the number of students who go to school is increasing infected with food allergies.
Now in U.S., one of every 20 children has food allergies.
CDC found that 18 percent of the children's food allergies between 1997 and 2007 have increased between 1997 and 2007.
In this direction, the schools provide information about how teachers and employees should be indicated about the food allergies of children, and how to handle them in the situation of an algebraic reaction.
The students are also advised to keep the stack of Epiphany in order to face the potentially deathal intensity (affilexy) - which is the auto-indicator of the Epiphany Brand, which is most commonly used.
The Kingdom Constitution has recently updated the rules, which schools can easily keep the stocks of EPNEFRIN's more easily.
The report also includes the list of common symptoms caused by children with algebraic reactions.
The children may say, "It looks like something's in my tongue," "It looks like I have a hair on my tongue," or "I'm sneaking in my tongue."
Parents of intercessors can choose their children's 'original '
German European Union has become the first country to accept the third gender for children born with fuzzy genocide.
Now the newborn children will no longer be specified in the refrigerator.
According to the new law, parents do not need to announce gender for such children, this law allows them to declare lyn on the birth certificate 'default" or "unspecified" on the child.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce the pressures of parents who can quickly take decisions related to sexual-respecting techniques for new children, and fight prejudice against Internet sex children.
According to BBC, an interviewer said years later, "I'm not a man, nor a woman."
I'm gonna be a jewelry made by doctors.
According to the estimate, one of the two thousand children is a child who is neither male nor female.
They are intercess, part of a group of about 60 positions, which comes under the test of sexual development disorders, this is a common word that is used for non-ordained quality, genetics, or naturally developing gender.
Maybe the Wallis Simson is intercepting.
But most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information to specify when a gender is not possible, and to make sure that the child's mental and physical development is inevitable.
Dr. Jack Dresser, a expert in the affairs of लिंग-patchan in New York City, said that Germany's new law "believes the best thing."
Intercessors create moral insensitivity.
They said: "There are people who are in a state of life who need health, but most of them do not.
You can only specify the gender without hygiene, and then see how the identity grows.
Science is not very accurate to know how any gender will develop in a child.
No one can answer the right why this happens.
It's a kind of puzzle that people are homosexual.
Intercessors have been described as different in terms of transsexuals or transactions in 2011 because they are not related to gender but are related to the biological design that is not clearly neither male nor female but that is either united or both.
These attributes can display self-extraordinary sexual analysiss, such as the weight of masturbation, the distribution of children, the stomach and the length; the primary sex embalming, such as the production and generation; or the quality quality structure and the Hormon.
The report also provides a violation of injustices, violence, and prejudice crimes in the field of laborers with interceptions and transactions.
Now there are special camps for boys who are not married.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark the elderly on their official documents, men, women, or "thirty gender".
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norree Me-Walby, won the "unspected" Legal Apple for the "encouragement" of the world's first "excluding" people.
According to the intercessor, the German passport will also be the third specification for individuals outside M or F for the Internet.
According to the news report on France 24, there are still conflicting issues related to gender in France.
In 2011, this hardly-between Catholic country has signed a request to return to university books to the "Longing Principles".
The U.S. website also opposed the German law, saying, "When the world is going to be in a state where लिंग is the choice option, but not sexual activity, we're moving two other columns in the opposite direction."
The mother of a new child in Maryland also told Baby Joan that she would like to see the gender specified at birth.
They said on the website about child rearing, "Brothers are very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is."
Children need stability and determination.
Historically, the children born with both male and female were called Hermefroudites (UVylyly), which was in the name of the beautiful Greek god who was bilingual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered lyn as a slit that could be removed and later written.
But now many people are trying to challenge the morality of surgeon, they're thinking that sex is complex, and sometimes the doctors who don't know what the kids will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
Dresser says, "In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "Monomic infectional".
When they were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called Sly-chinicus.
The current principle on the treatment of the children who are illiterate has been presented by Dr. John Mani of the Hopkins University, who viewed the lyrics as sympathetic.
He built the word "Longing Identity" and reasoned how social and environmental indications - parents raise the child - instinct with the child's genes and Hormones to determine whether he is known as a male or as a woman.
But in one case of 1966, the principles of Joan/Joan became debated.
He advised his parents to get the whole tiger and get her eggs out of the ladder and to be like a red-white girl.
Dasher said, "The case has been presented as a successful case, but it has not happened."
At 15 years of age, the child changed himself as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he was suicide.
Dasher said there are still some doctors who're still doing the same image.
But in the 1990 ’ s, with the Internet's arrival, people who jumped from these ling-chichicuss began to come forward "not happy with the results".
That was the case with 36-year-old writer Jim Brusus, who was born with X.Y. man's quality, but his genetic was obscured.
The doctors didn't clearly understand that his gender was small, or his gender was too big, but they were sure he could never live as a man.
So a few days after his birth in 1976, Brus was evicted by the external body and Andkosh Shali-chikitza and grew up like a girl.
She was given the woman Hormon at 12 years of age.
He said to ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was hard to question.
At 18 years of age, Vazineplastti was going to be with him.
But, as a result, he demanded medical archives.
This made him aware of the horrible truth.
When I was born - and no one ever told me.
Bruns was born with DSD, who prevented his body from making enough testosteron, which could not make his genetic progress properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man, he took the testosteron and removed his stomach.
He's grown up because of the surgeon.
Today, he explains people about Internet sex people in the interface project organization.
However, California-based advocates for Informed Chaos, the governor of California, Anny Tammer-Mattis, complains that the German law "invites chipy and rumors."
They say, "Many activists think that the German law will move parents to make a quick decision and to specify the child "default".
We're afraid it'll encourage the intervention.
We think it's better to specify the male or female gender rather than wait.
But we don't know how the law will carry its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law because "it allows the elderly to be identified in the third gender."
He said, "The adults should be able to make their own decisions about sex."
The German law is related to specifying it at birth.
It's not a war fighting by new children at this time.
When they grow up, they can make decisions related to their body.
But Pittsburgh's stable radiology Dr. Erlen Baratz, whose daughter has sexual intelligence disease, and who supports hundreds of other people, said that the German law will give both parents and children "power."
Barazy's daughter was born with carts, but she was a full Androgen insensitive sensitivity name Dr. S. D.D..
Since his Androgen was a problem in the village, women grew up in Caty.
He's in his body, but there's no pregnancy or burial.
Now 29-year-old Cat is married and is regidated at the child psychology Department in Pencilvinia University.
Although she's a baby, she expects to be a mother through a ball or a Gestapo Sergeosi.
Baratz said, "This law gives parents not to make their own decisions quickly."
It gives them the time to understand and time by a few tests before writing, 'man' or 'man'.
In this way, you live - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely child and enjoy it.
We don't need to make a quick treatment that can't be done back.
They said, "It brings the children a decision, and delivers them from the agents of their parents. That is because they do not believe that they are doing good."
Finally, the child will decide which sex he is more easy -- and that's very good.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

The report: Think of the Biden dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to New York Times, the closest counselors of the president of Barak Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton on the position of the president of the United Nations.
The most outstanding threat in secretabadton is that Mark Halperen and John Heleman have a heavy 2012 campaign team, "DublDown: Change Game 2012."
Times received a copy of the Agami book and explained what the top advisers of the president can help Obama to learn how to help the Obama to reevaluate the "weak group-stars and delay 2011" in order to get the top of the president's top advisers.
According to Times National Politics journalist Jonathan Martin, the book provides full information on the campaign of the main authority and put on the head of the White House Stuff for the name, to see how the victory Clinton of the East affects the polish.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the baseline of the Chicago campaign and within the Oval Office.
Only about half of the dozen counselor - with the pre-Obama campaign chief Jim Massina, and former White House counselors, David Oxlerd and David Polofuffe, were asked for change.
"Dubble Dawn" claims that Kay tried to change Biden, despite their personal balance, when his information was being informed of the clinton's ticket will not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dale confirms that the institution really thought about the place of Clinton with Biden.
"I looked at the entire view, and one of them, that was," said the newspaper.
And you remember that the president was in danger at that time, and we were in a synagogue such as said, Holy Christ, what shall we do?
While Dale told the Research as "Attention", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign returned to the very important conclusion that it would give the benefit of the discovery of the poll.
"As the campaign isn't spending on drugs and focus groups as long as they're seriously thinking about something," said Martin on AC360.
It's fuzzy, Halaki, what Obama knew their team was looking for change.
Martin told Cynn that they asked him if he knew about the possible change?
While Dale said it didn't seem to have known the president about the possible change, "Perhaps of Stef acknowledged that it was "like" that Obama knew it.
"Dubble Down" sure: willn't answer whether the political is going to reach Obama's desk?
Cooper asked Martin if he was seriously thinking that Obama Beden Dumping ticket wasn't aware of the ticket.
"Perhaps," said Martin.
Does glo-in-de-Dark IS Cream like?
A British analysis has made the first of the world's glo-in-daker Ice Cream - Jeliphish.
Charlie Francis has benefited greatly from the sea creature to develop the best surveillance.
After reading a research letter on Jeliphs, he came to the idea, and the skeptical scientists of China used the chemical light to renew the protein.
Ice Cream, responding to the feeder's tongue, will increase the PATIN's PATH and ISCREAM will shine.
Chris says that the Icecream is a spectacular reflection of the heat of the mouth, or the winning will be more likely to be.
Charlie, director of the IM Delisius Icecream company, said: "This is untrustworthy, but I will get some 2 gamma material from the beginning of the early days."
The protein we're using in Icecream will respond to the Netral Piech in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is hot, the protein will increase the PAH level and the icecream will shine.
We've been investigating for a few months and it seems to be a good way to share it on Helowin because it has a wonderful light effect.
It may be the most expensive ice cream that has been made because the zeliphish brightness is four times greater than gold.
So the cost of each skup comes to me about 140 pounds (140 pounds).
Despite thiska taste, it's very good.
In Charlie's Bristol, it is known for an unusual taste of apne, including beer, pineer, meat and gold sheets.
But his next design is going to be more important.
He said, "I really wanted to develop an invisible Ice Cream."
It's naturally impossible because of the snow crystal that makes up the icecrem, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice Cream is the utility of an influential quality of a Jeliphish, which is defined by Chinese scientists.

Paltaka's businessman has been trapped in after the Haikort's command.
Not now, they can't trade in the temporary markets made in the rural Avenue, nor have they been launched for businesses in Transport Aria.

In a minefield, 50 feet [50 m] above a devastating mountain was called to save a lost powder on the face of a devastating mountain
COKER SPANIAL Ruby fled after a little road crash.
Three days later he was shown by a Doug Walker
The fireworks brought down the next part of the rock to protect the dog from death
After he was caught on the face of a devastating mountain over 50 feet by Poppy, he was called by fireworks.
Nine months' cockr Spanish Ruby fled on Sunday after coming to a street truck, and three days before the Wednesday was saved from the treasure.
Their owners, Scot Elderson, 25, and their Garlford Becky Hall, 20 Denhom, were in the Philippines of the West Yorkshire to meet Ruby, and they blessed the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
After a small accident, they searched for their lost dog like dogs, and they posted on social networking sites.
On Wednesday 2.15, a bright look-like dock Walker saw Ruby on the hill at the height of the ground from 50 feet.
A technical rescue team from Clechhiton Fire station came to the ceremony and descended down by russy to protect Ruby and used a pilot tube to bring it down from the rock.
“He was in a very difficult situation,” said the expertly technical security officer Andy Clayton.
It was between the front part of the rock, up and down to 50 feet.
He didn't do anything during his rescue, it was a stone.
But now he's good.
Then she was eating a bस्कott.

Ms. Hole from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was horrible to see the work."
I didn't believe how they came to him.
It's strange to find him back in his hands.
The animal doctor said that if she were too tired and fell down, she would certainly fall down.
The fireflies did a great work.
What they did is really a brave work.
We're their strangers, and they're all good.
Mr. Elderson also said: "We were afraid she could fall, but she stayed there."
The fireflies did a great work.
I don't believe how she came over there.

George Carevon: Euro Vigton gave the skets the option
Another day, another story of the fear of freedom
This time, we are warned that free Scottland will need to be part of a free travel zone in Europe as a registration of EU.
On Burwick, the passport control and the walls of Hedrian point to the radiation of the storys.
True that Strathclide Paper described the possible financial benefits of freedom with the rest of Europe, although - notedly - in the headlines.
And no one described that the members of the EU members spend most of their time changing their own natural rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is not a region, Brussels really will get what he wants from Scotland will be easily free for non-unpleasant brussels instead of getting what he wants.
So, then, A-Chanie.
And what's been so long that it's enough. First of all, I heard the news about freedom means passport control.
Still, the stunning point was lost to rehearse the old story.
Why should it be expected to sell Europe from the free Scottland?
Why should London's Yok be sold for Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great, war-white plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With Euro trouble, the project is officially dead in Europe.
In the whole EU, the dedicated groups are getting strong enough to stop EU, either against or as a composite currency.
Even in Germany, Eurostepel Alternetev for the German party that has been established this year - suddenly came and found about 50 million votes in the United Nations elections, and thus evicted Free Democrates from Bundastag.
The plan to build the U.S. Europe is always opposed.
However, the current economic crisis proved to be major changes.
With the harsh rules imposed by the Berlin and the European Central Bank, as well as the restrictions on national economy, many people have to think that the project has gone far away from Europe.
It was not the most important part of Euro's trouble in the most devastating valley of national governments - that was the truth about Greece.
In fact, the Euro system set its members up to the monetary Exchange rate in behalf of German exporters - something that German politicians want to keep.
Without the chance of the homelife evaluation, South Europe finds himself in an influential situation in the intervening state of the production of Germany.
The only way to minimize the promotion and public business - which is encouraged by Berlin.
The current budget and curiosity suffers a deep European production from problems.
In order to free the users of French and German energy forces - due to the "white" power policy set by Brussels, the European economy pays four times for electricity and gases for the United Nations rather than for the U.S.
This is the cost that we've already seen in Graynemouth.
Even the world can't save the European Petrochemils industry from being affected by the SCS shell gas.
As a result, the spirit of rebelism in people is aggressive, especially in France, who had ever been the chief commendation of the EU.
Following the war, France's top politicians saw EU, controlling Germany, and Paris as a way to provide billings in the world.
But Berlin now does not need Paris as a passport for political validity, and he has applied his own economic policy on Europe, which causes France's economic decline.
The result: Marine Lee Pen, the Southeastern National Front of EU, has won the regime in the recent subchunada, defeated the Socialist in the third place.
Currently, French is the most popular group with 24 percent of vote - it's a time warning for British Leber that they can not believe that it will benefit himself for the left, for the left.
What is Le Pen French Gorns doing with his newly received publicity between the workshops?
This group is trying to make the EU, the most important currency group in the European edition of the following year.
If, as much as possible, the eU-opposing teams in these choices can be affected by the European economy the first time.
My view is: Soon the EU will end the eruption of opposition and the most sensible curiosity in Europe.
Euro won't end completely, but it's going to be back in a way like "(Lord) Europe of the nations" that will support the general de Goll.
Germans and some of its features can keep Euro, but France and South Europe will re-establish their curiosity.
I hope U.K will keep myself away from this project.
However, the increasing interest of the Avashigton in Pakistan suggests that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all this?
We can choose to be the area of Little England (actually).
Or we can protect our own financial interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels to separate themselves at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better functions in the lazy European system, if we keep our own leg.
It will be easier to work along with other similar opinions in Europe in non-national nations.
Otherwise we should think of keeping our financial freedom on the way to Norway.
In Scotland - the government - the most successful media-religious political campaign in Europe, which was advocated by the chessler Elistler Darling (or activist) in the year 2011 by Torie-Lib Dem Construction.
For Scotland at this time, it would be uncomfortable to vote for freedom, because in that case it will accept the rules of the medicinals planted by Berlin and Brussels.
Youths before time: Hurrying
The discoveries indicate that African-American and Hippenic girls get sex in less age than their young girls.
Physical change does not mean that yoga is near
There is no evidence that hormone or other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe that the stomach can be a cause of infection in less ages
The case of sex before time is not so effective among the boys
CNN's former chatter Pat Ethriz is expert journalists in health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter starts to develop stomachs in the age of 7 or 8.
This week, Orelando, the American Child Medical Association in Academy at the United States's annual assembly in Florida, Bal Medicine and Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are common among American girls, which represent the new movement.
"I spend a lot of time to convince the administrations - that it normally does not represent fast progress in the direction of the entire sex."
The explicit sign of development, such as the roots of the stomach, the gene and the hair of the genetic and physical synthetic girls, is seen before the time.
But in the past four decades, the life of Rajooa (prinst Majorism) has been very small.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5, which was 12.75 years in 1970.
"When the stomach starts developing, it takes at least two or three years in the revolution," says the caplowitz, which is "the premature youth: the best guide to solve this common problem."
The best test time of yoga's development.
There is a debate about what sex starts, but when steel increases before the age of eight, it is called "Bal-old".
In most cases this process will slow down or stop - which hair can be monitored almost.
In a faster progress, an analysis may require testing by Andorranologies to remove the potential problems such as Tumers or systems.
Time-previous month-to-days and other results are treatments: time-prediction-year-olding periods, which may cause intensity increases and increases as old age.
Drugs or hormones depend on the age of a child, development rate, growth rate, and emotional growth.
The psychological aspects are also important.
Caplowitzs are well aware of drugs but admits, "Presenting youth can increase positive points, and girls may begin to feel separated from their peers."
The other big problem can be considered: The prosecutor does not just want to have their little age's daughter to be mammals.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will keep clean."
A woman, whose daughter started math religion at 10 years of age, remembers, "It was fever."
Although there were signs of this thing, we also talked about mathism, but it was not emotionally ready.
She was afraid of her school and worried that she had first started math religion in her friends.
There are many practical principles about the reasons for the incomparable sex.
Still, there is no constant evidence that the hormone in milk or other foods can be blamed in the environment, in ceremony, or in the media.
The boys - like girls - pre-time sexes.
Cappolowitz decides that the most important reason for it is the anger of stability.
He helped to conduct study over 6 to 9 years of age girls in 2001, which unite the body’s vices with the period of sex.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hisppenic girls are forced to get sex before their age girls.
There are many explanations of this.
On the global level, the image of the time-previous embryo, from economic conditions to the weather and genes, seems to be affected by all things.
Other puzzles: Even though boys are getting the hairs of face and genetic hair at low age, the entire sex behavior of girls is not as clear as they are.
Other doctors who attended the AAP conference support the complexity of the subject.
Even the hairs of the teeth and the hair of the teeth have become common among children and children.
"We need to be careful about how we recognize the real start of the youth in the hospital," says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, in the Gorgeb Childress Hospital in New Zealand.
The experts should not hesitate to take guidance from their child medical to discuss this matter with their children.
Caplowitz suggested, "That might mean talking before the expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will normally answer correctly.
Women who develop from time to time need to be reassured that it's since time, but it's part of normal life.
The armour was registered in temperature 3.1 degrees Fahrenheit (3.1 degrees Celsius).
The rain and the cold wind, on the Wednesday night, caused the people to feel cold.
And they went out into their markets, and into their places, by the tweets of the mighty men.
The first rain of the winter has come forth, and the people have taken it away.
The people came to see the sun, even in the morning.
It will also be easier to change the weather, but after that the sunshine continued to be covered all day long after the clouds were covered.
The children also came to their school by wearing a sweater.
And there, according to the Airfour Weather Department, the Army was the maximum temperature of 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature of 13.7 degrees Celsius.

For the seat width, the jet is on the big orders of creation.
A battle for this month's dubai Arsro has been in the middle of the airports for long distances for the airport-cluster seats for the long distance.
The debate focuses on the width of the Iconomy class, not always given by Erlines but on the latte Zeit Jets SAS and Boing company claims to be a key.
This week, Arbass is the large seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) of Economy Cabin, but it should be fixed by Arlines.
The debate comes between the airplane buildings after the event of 17-21 when the orders registered from the long distances of the Arcropht's large engines were competing to sell the large engine.
How was the last part of the plane made - especially if the singing is 9 or 10 equals to greater capacitys, being designed by Mini Jambo Jaits?
Boing says it's made "777 X" which will put 406 people in 17 inches [17 cm] wide and 10 people in a row will be in a unique section.
Airbus says it's going to take 350 people in 18 inches [18 cm] to the seat.
The airplanes often trade trade trades on technical matters through the advertisements in the business press.
Now, with Airbes 77 x, the double Arusho hopes to have more than 100 ordeals, the public is being appealing.
It's recently seen that there's something going on at the beginning of the war of the riot, showing Fincero that this shows to the Finnishero three together in a radar together?
Airbes seller John Lehi said, "Boing is a long flight to the regional Turbo" in the concrete.
As a change, people's getting great enough, but the way to sit on the plane is not the change.
According to the statistics of the U.S. Health Department in the 1970 ’ s, when Boing 747 Navy was defined as a modern - day trip to the Tha, and ant of the century, I was an average of 40 - 49 - year - old American male that increased me to 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average number of American men in the 21st century is 39.7 inches [39.7 cm].
Airbes says it has been ticked from a seat in 1950 when the new name "Jet Set" was the average continent.
Airbes says they have set up the Research Commission that suggests an additional 53 percent to improve the quality of sleep in the height of the seat.
Boing argued on the figures of Airbad's seats, and it said that it does not depend on the decision of the builders, how the Airlines makes balance between the costs and services.
It also says, the research depends on the experience of Kabin more than the width of a seat.
Boing Kevin expert said that "It actually gives Airlines laziness and shows what they need to do to succeed."
"They don't want to tell us what they benefit."
They're better aware of their business than anyone else.
It's about the vacation room for Flyers, but it's an important point for the operators that it can affect I.
The business of at least 700 billion dollars after this debate is estimated to be enough in the decades that the combat of airports in U.S.A. and the European Export is to be tweeted.
Reiter's report is the first time in July, what seat loop is actually the issue of war between new jet planes.
Airbes and Boing claimed that each seat has 20% of its new compound engine designs, equal to 365-sitt Boing 777-300 array.
The claim of Boing’s display depends on the comparativeity of 10 to 777 X square root of 977 design.
It's 10 to use the comparison with profit in the unit cost.
Kevin Kenniston, Europe's Airbes traveler, says Head, "Boying's plane is going to take over more seats to make their plane more competition with our products and more competition."
On the other hand, the analysts say that the entire 10-sheet line is suggesting for the current 77S that many passengers are on the side of the Denser Leout, which can also go with steel.
KBin's internal expert said my cherry, agnostics, and the Ranwei girl network of the editor, "It will be very good for the seat width passengers of eighteen inches, but the fact is that the business point of Airbus is composed by the threat of 77"
The Airbes and Boeing Seats are not available but provide a list to select the providers for airlines.
The jet vendor of the world is also careful to analyze this layout competition.
As more relaxing, all buildings are giving high density layouts for jet air services and regional trips.
It's 10 to A350 but it's not sold right now.
But recently, while Airbes stressed the cabin seats on some of its jet planes to need more cabins.
Modern jet planes are not likely to fill a new product on the standard without support of another Creator, but it can distort the wave of 77 X bills.
New anti-Nicotin vixin can end the joy of smoking.
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotin Vaxin, which can end the fund that comes from smoking.
One of Vaxin's only fowls was able to protect them from nicotine's disease for the whole life.
There is a need for further testing before the man starts investigation, which may take many years, but Professor Ronald Christal of Wil Cornel Medical College in New York said that internal signals are positive.
Professor Cornnel said: "We hope this kind of victory can help millions who have tried to quit smoking, using all the methods in the market today, but they found that Nikotian’s vaccine is more powerful than these current methods."
The new Waxine has a damaged virus, which has been prepared to provide genetic information for the purpose of creating anti-Nicotics antibodies.
This virus, selectively attacks the cells, which then begin to build a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies search for any nicotine in the blood, and prevent them from getting the need of Nikotin inside the cigarettes before entering the brain.
In test, Vaxin was given the chicken that later Nicotine was later given, they continued to perform their normal activities.
Researchers say, but the chicken that was not given the vixin was "beautiful," was an indication that Nikotin had reached his brain.
This use was defined in the Census Translator Medicine magazine.
The Waxine of the former Tambaku failed because they had an antibodies.
It had to feed on regular intervals, to keep the standard of antibodies, but it became expensive and unfortunate.
But new Vaxin's price is expected to be too large, because it will make the cell a factory for antibodies.
Professor Christol said that if the future human vixine is completely safe, it can be given to children before they want to smoke, to protect them from Nikotin's addiction.
But it may be used to skip smoking by people who smoke.
He said, "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will have no pleasure in smoking because of the victoria of Nicoten, which can help them recover their habit."
British scientists pointed to the result, but they warned of the need to be more researched.
Even after postmartum, Baghin's death was not due to real reason.
The Van department is telling the death of the first eyewitness Baghin.

The former ENSW workman will be examined by the Stats Corpson Watchdog on the Tripodi.
The former UNNW worker who refused to follow his political leader Eddie Obbyid's request for the policies on the seaports on JATTPodi, which was hidden in three countries.
On Friday investigation against corruption, Mr. Obide did not break the sentences of the posts of advocates by several Kingdom ministers?
Lin Ashpole, after the testimony given by pre-Chiff of Staff on Thursday, did Mr. Tripodi Obide know the selfishness of the charge?
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government pressured to start public techniques.
The guards were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, Obadid renewed the entry to the plates, which was $2.5 million a yearly, without strands.
Mr. Tripodi, who was a minister of garbage from February 2006 to November 2009, was initiated by public tender.
But they refused to change to Mr. Obide's request, Mr. Tripodi demanded to change the government's policy.

According to the authorities, Israeli fighters ran into Syria.
The Jezreel stadiums made the city of Latakia a target on Thursday night, confirming that Fox News.

On the 457 VJ, foreign workers can surveillance "authority" test.
The government is considering a "authority" test for foreign workers on Vija on the Vasa, because it is to expand a hard act.
If it is accepted, this test will be applied through a standard designed to prevent family and friends from being used to reach or expanded in Australia.
Today a government discussion was issued, refusing to denounce the government's volcanic activists, the former Lebre M. M. M. McKu said that this could disrupt neighboring countries in Australia today.
He said to the United States Institute today, "The foreigners are coming to the end of the queue," and the strong statement about the Australians before work is very disgusting at a time, while the Union has demanded a safe labor market."
Historically, it meant that white workers were to be protected - and if some people in the area saw the evidence of that historical fact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion post represents 12 alternatives, which were previously considered by former advocate Chris Bowen.
Province Prime Minister Brendan O'Conor who was in Sri Lanka, where he found the authorities on which he found the people who smuggled, has enabled five controversy changes, while the rest are surviving.
If "authority" is accepted, the Vijaa advocates can be checked about whether "name" is true in situations that are known as a person, the owner of the person or the person of a suitable person's or a personal friend.
The businessmen may need to count 457 VJsers, because the first businessmen who wanted to organize the workmates in lesser numbers kept hundreds of people at work.

And his nine-year-old son was come to Australia with him; and on Wednesday, after his father's death, one of his oldest brother, which was on the twilight.
Australian authorities brought him Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the Scotland project from the HS2 railway project.
HS2 directs high speed services in the north of England, which will soon start with the first step in 2026.
Transmission Minister Barons Cremer said this project would be "Britine One."
In Scotland's transportation minister Kith Brown said they were very "thanked" by working with the British government on this project.
First step includes a new high railway line between London and West Middlelands.
When the second step is over, the lines will reach Manchester and Lids.
In June, the government changed the cost of building a high speed link between London and North England by 72.7 Billion.
The British government, which was discussing with the Scotland transport, directed Limidt to consider the potential for the North England and the railways of Scotland.
It includes the possible trip time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.
According to Barons Cremer: "Our goal is to have a real national network for HS2, which will bring us close to Yuke and its cities."
We're going ahead with HS2, because it's much profit.
Without it, we will face problems with our rail network's ability.
But this is also about the connection between 18 cities in Britain and Glasgow and Edinburg, which will be closely connected with HS2.
According to Scotish Secretary Elester Carmel: "The announcement of today is well-known for Scotland."
For the Scotish government, Kith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmick to return the "Spotland" back to the network in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "High speed is likely to be a big financial profit to Scotland from the railway rail, but this will also increase the financial burden on Scottland in all the country's high speed railways.
So we are enthusiastically enthusiastic to work in the British government's participation, so that we can test the options to create the high speed rail in Scotland, to create the benefit for all, and to complete the glasgo-edinburg line, which is already planning for the Scotish government.
I'm ready to review the test report with the British government ministers and make a decision together in the next year.
Air Force Forces Will Be Engineed in Australia
It must continue to close your tablets and smart phones while driving Australian airports and airplanes in the U.S.
US Union plane Administration has opened up the options to change its processes, so the travelers will be able to read e-books, see videos, or play games on their devices, if they remain in "Wawyan" mode.
The travelers can still do this during many flights, but many people do not seem to be uncomfortable to reach their e-books when the airplane goes down.
Australian Air Force Service companies are considering the decision, according to the US Air Force Service companies will have to work much to accomplish this need, but they have suggested that they have no quick plan to change their processes.
The citizen plane security authorities also said she was thinking about the announcement, but it emphasized that the ban has still been effective on the use of electrical tools in the important steps of flight in Australia.
"CA at the current time, there is no specific aims to control electrical equipment in the air," the authorities said, "this issue comes under Violence, according to the air service operation companies to ensure that the security system is always established, and the passengers have to follow the security instructions provided by the members of the drivers."
Virgin who is already talking to CASA about expanding his access to the use of the Internet Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he asked for further action on the In-fly Wi-Fi entertainment system.
"We will welcome a review by CASA on the use of electrical tools, because we really think it will give the clients a better experience, because we (Warles in-flying entertainment) now have our planes.
Quantas said it would now follow the current rules.
He said, "Our current policy cannot be used by electrical tools during the airplane and the plan to change it immediately."
The FAA decision applies to the U.S. Ellalines.
In the same way, we have always been interested in the diverse developments that can benefit the passengers, and we will surely consider FAA's decisions and reasons behind them.
The effect of this decision, each U.S. air-service company will be different and depends on their plane's age.
Voyan Service companies will need to verify that their plane can endure radioactivity from mobile devices, and they have to research their rules books, training materials, Cari-on baggage programs and passengers in shorter detail.
FAAA said, "When the airlines have been authorized by their plane's endurance, he will allow the passengers to hold all the high altitudes, the light weight of the electricity, such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones."
In the low-affected situation, the driver will guide the team passengers to stop their devices while they are moving on the plane.
The group also suggests that heavy devices be kept under the seat or put in the upper docks during the airplane and the plane.

325 million dollars saving package for Tajy’s health
The U.S. government emphasized that there are hard conditions for the health system of Tasmania’s survival of 325 million dollars that will be sure that the government could not destroy the government.
The United Nations Health Minister Tania Plibersec announced that the population of the island is growing, the high rate of green diseases, and the current disasters due to the limits of the system.
For four years, the decision to be made was made after the government's consultation with Free Sand Andro Wilki, Tasmania.
Sussie Plibersec today said, "Correctional industry is the package, which we believe it will solve the special challenges faced by the Kingdom.
The package of 325 million dollars includes 31 million dollars alternative surgery schemes.
With the orthopedic and motivating surgery, 2600 additional operations will help solve the past collected issues.
It also includes good care after leaving the Hobart and Lonestson, better medical experts, training for mental health services, and personal electronic health archive systems.
Sussie Plibersec said, "These investments are the best ways to improve Tasmania's health system by doctors."
The minister stressed that Tasmanian government will face severe reporting and demanding regime.
The Kingdom needs to keep the current-productive level to get the country's economy, and every month reporting where additional demands are being applied.
The three members will be organized to make sure that they have a powerful and effective service through the Kingdom.
Mr. Wilki said that 325 million dollars would not be much more, "until the public health system of Tasmania is not corrected to reach more effective levels."
Yet, they praised the government for responding to their request for help, which they brought to the chief of the first time in May."
Mr. Wilki said, "I hope the Unional Help package will be very helpful in the direction of the State Ray Public Health System to separate from the insecure list."
According to the Kingdom government, these additional alternative processes will mainly restore the recent cuttings.
But the United Nations Institute Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "Band-Ed Solutions."
He said to the ABC TV, "We're here because Laber State has taken 430 million dollars in his health system.
You can't believe it as a good news day to take about half a billion dollars by the Kingdom government and pay 300 million dollars by the National Constitution.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Sussie Plibercec should give him a guarantee that no one of the saving packages will be paid on extra jobs.

And then the original registry was missing in the jali registry record.
Then the chargers sold the land into hundreds of silver on the Jali document.
There, they took Lone on these web documents.
Then the real owner of the land was eaten by police and administration.
The chargeers who made the Jali registration were specially watching the landscape of EnRIG.

According to the police, the party's sergeants are already investigating and stealing cases against Raj.
Crying on the boom explosioner’s punishment in Balli
In 2002, 202 people killed in the bomb bombs and relatives cried out to the victim of the bomb explosion, saying that the U.S. pocket should face the firearms.
Pek, who ran as one of the most demanded people in Southeast Asia for about 10 years, was announced for his role in creating the bomb explosion in building the device.
It can be released in 15 years after the parool is given.
The 45-year-old age was attacked in two nightclub in the famous Cupa area, where 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many were wounded.
He was also found guilty of many other accusations associated with terrorism, including the sermon bomb explosion in Indonesia at the east of the year Crismas in 2000.
The organizers were demanding the punishment of life's death, although they could even ask that the man who was called "a murderer" as the master who built the bomb.
This decision renewed the sad memories of the woman in Perth, who had lost her 39-year-old daughter in the destruction attack by the devastating constitutionals a year ago and her colleagues.
When they stopped their tents, they said that they should have been put to death.
I really feel he should be punished like other terrorists.
Mr. Cortin said, "He should be put in front of the firering team."
I have to live without my grandson and my daughters every day.
At 11 o’clock in October 2002, the club was lost after the explosion of the bomb loaded outside the whole club.
Peter Huges was in the padage bar when the backpack was emitted 20 seconds before the explosion of the explosion of the suicide attackers.
As a result of this bomb explosion, they went to the long comma for a month and died three times during their lifesaving tools.
Mr. Hughes says that the Pek should have been the same punishment that JAMMHH was found to be the three other members of the terrorist army for this murder - Amozi, Moullas and Emma Sea - who had been killed four years ago.
In fact, this person must be executed before anyone else.
To keep him alive, look, there's no reason to keep him alive.
It's not enough for 202 people to be killed and bruised, it's 20 years of sentence.
Pack, the last person to be punished from the Balli bomb explosion.
He was spared for about a decade, but eventually, in January 2011, he was arrested in Abtababad, Pakistan, where the U.S. Army formerly killed Osama Bin Laden after four months.
The FBI Agent presented evidence that Bill was in Pakistan in trying to reestablish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Alkaida.
Sussie Cortin says, "He didn't surrender."
Even today, he is not really pained by the pain of so many people.
The decision came this year before the 10th year of attack, which will be marked by celebrations in Balai and Australia.
Mr. Cortin said, "This year will be very tears."
Even the plate can still appeal against his punishment.
FAA: Airparents can now use gadgets in airplane (but the cell phone cannot be called)
The airline passengers will be able to use their electronic device to go to the gate from the gate, to work, to play games, to see movies, to listen to music - but can't talk to their cellphones - that's an extra-precedented under the U.S. directives.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
FAA's Administration Michael Hurtta said how fast these changes are processed, it will be separated in every airline.
The Airlines of the FA will indicate how their plane, new directions, and how the rules are uploaded to the members of your driver team's training books and devices to collect them.
The FAA said that it already obtained schemes from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the plane.
Delta and Jetblu are from those airlines who have already presented plans.
FAA said in an episode, "By the position of planning, we can readily accept use of the advanced electronic device.
However, passengers need to close their smartphone, tablet, and other devices when the air gate is closed.
They are expected to not start until they are allowed by Captain to reach the height of 10,000 feet of the plane.
The passengers are expected to stop their device when they get down on the plane, and don't run it until the plane is completely down.
The FAA said that there are airlines under new directions whose airlines are completely safe from electronic drugs, they may allow their passengers to use the device when the plane gets down, and at the time of taxing.
The majority of new airline companies and other airplanes that have been modified this way are expected to fulfill these values.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of the Professional Flight Institute, welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy will work safely - and we'll work together with the Airlines company to do this -- it's the winning thing for both sides."
When it comes to this point, we've been warming like "Hal Moniters."
Agnes said that it will still be restricted to connecting to the Internet to less than 10,000 feet [10.000 m], to send, to send or get the message, or to download data.
The passengers will be asked to put their smartphone, tablet, and other device in the Airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversations with friends, as well as online scrabbles, which is the popular event of the year when the acter Elke Baldwin played on his smartphone during the air pocket, in 2011, and the American Airlines had removed the airlines when they were blocking the device.
And there will still be a collection of laptop industry, such as laptops, because they will be concerned about hurting another person in Kebin.
Celphone calls will continue to be blocked during the flight.
Vinicaic rights corresponding to phone calls are near the United Nations Communication Academy, not with an FA.A.
The ban may be removed on some electronic devices while filling and moving the airplane.
Last month, Mark Rosenkon, of the National Environmental Security Department, said that the cell phone is still in danger.
Rosenkar said, "Cell phones are really serious issues, but not because they can instinctively create in the navigational-related device, but also because they can create in the cell phone towers when they are in the air.
To test this issue, FAA, the U.S. Communication Committee of the U.S. Communication of the U.S. government should allow more of personal electronic devices to be used.
FAA is increasing in recent years to reduce restrictions.
San. Claire Maccasquick, such as D-Mo, has said that there is no valid security reason to ban.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult because the device's use is provocative.
Some studys also indicate that nearly a third of the travelers forget or ignore the direction to stop their device.
FAA started using electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when a report was received in the navigation and communication tools for taking the FM radio and the high-productive gages by passengers.
New Airlines company, more depends on electronic systems than the previous generation of airplanes, but they are also designed and accepted to resist electronic intervention by FA.
Airlines have been proposing the Y-Fi on the crossing height from passengers for years.
The Wi-Fi system is also more resistant to the plane inhibition.
Hurta said that most Airlines companies should be able to complete the values of the electronic device in order to use the new direction.
Today's electronic device, a few of the radio transmissions of the previous electronic device.
For example, when the e-readers turn the page, there is a total transmission of the name.
But transmission is useful when downloading or sending data by device.
Amazon.com is also among those who have defended the blocking of the device used by passengers.
In 2011, the company's officials loaded their entire Kindal e-readers in Airlines and launched him to test the problems, but there was no such problem.
The FAO adviser committee expressed the mis-communicational feelings about the dangers that can be used by the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Air Force Union said that they believe the immune system is real, even if it is a threat.
Other members of the committee said that the report was only defined by pilots in support of the device in the Aircraft system, most of them are very old.
However, members of the Communist community suggested that the FAA pilot should allow them to command the passengers to stop the device while they are moving down to a low view.
The travel industry group has welcomed changes and called them the common knowledge of people who travel to the latest economy.
The U.S. Trawell Association said we're happy that FAI's glad to know that the traveling traveler with joy is not incompatible with security and security.
Learning from the jurisdiction bombs in Paltan, the U.T. Police took a tissue for the quick reconstruction during the survival of the Maddenger Divalley of security.

For protection from North C Rig, birds were left back in the wilderness by air transportation

Is Europe’s high class ready to work with Britain?
In April, the business for Britain was launched and promised to bring the business together and decide what changes we would like to see in our relationship with UK's employer and richer EU.
For him, we arranged for the largest and widest survey of British colonial leaders, and asked them what their views about Britain's business with EU.
U-Gove used to think about 1000 business leaders, who represent the commercial size of Britain, regions, and locations.
The conclusions of this survey can be strange to many people.
We found that a large part of businesses now want to export out of Europe, and they want to focus on the countries that are becoming and expanding, while the EU members of the U.S. are being rarely displaced.
They want the government to prefer new business relationships with countries such as China, India, and Brazil, not the galaxy of the secret organizations of EU.
When asked their opinions about specific policy areas such as the investment law, most business leaders believed they should come back to Westminster.
The common inconveniences could be quite easily seen, according to businessmen, the price of Brussels is more than the advantages of being a part of Europe's commercial field — even 40 percent of the large businessmen who were opposed to European companies.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of the economic leaders found that a large part of Britain, with EU, wanted to move on the way to business-based relationships and connections.
The conclusion, which was seen in the levels of the major business groups, indicated that the businessmen are moved to a "original change" that would restore the power of it to UK.
It's very high price - the point of the constitution change for Britain and the idea of getting a better deal changed 16 percent in the United States to remain in EU.
Prime Minister should not be in doubt: This survey reports that Britain's businessmen support their plans to talk on the terms of the British subscription in EU.
It also indicates that the businessmen, the current power balance, expects to change a meaningful change to the side of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is rapidly necessary, because Erogen, advancing economic and political organization.
The priority must be in Britain and increase, as the conclusions of our survey indicate that this means a new centered attention on business and basic changes in the violin function of Brussels.

The Royal Commission announced the charges of sexual crimes on two of the two employees before the charges against Jonathan Lord.
In 2011, two of the workmen of the Caringbaba Bay, who were accused of being accused against Jonathan Lard, have been guilty of blasphemous brutal crimes.
But in his statement to the Agency, he said, "It never came into the case of Baal sexual abuse within his organization," it was reported.
The main activist Philip Hare was asked about the case in which a worker was accused of child pornography crimes, and another case in which he was accused of blasphemous sexual crimes against children who were cared for in 1991.
Mr. Herre said they knew about the case first, but they didn't know about other issues.
He also acknowledged that the statement that "Y.M.A. has been checked and he has found the most forward to the child security" of the U.S. Agency.
In front of Aghan, it is a testimony that the Y.M.A. was notified, and this year she received four possible ratings in the education and community department featured in the United States.
Mr. Harare, who is associated with the Y.M.A., accepted that the arrangement has failed because the Lord has been appointed as a 21-year-old, and that failed to ensure that the workers were clearly aware of their capabilitys related to the child security policy.
At the beginning of this year, Lord was blamed for sexual crimes with 12 children during the two years of work.
He was punished for at least six years.

He said, rather, their friendship with Lord led their decision to inform him.
Mr. Here said he gave his view to the U.S. N.DB. Mundal that the text was "not about information about the "Jonathan Lockard Event" organization.
Mr. Here said that soon after the charge was issued, the decision was made to sign a secret agreement by the employees, by the Y.M.A., the child service's headman Leim Whitele.
He said that it was to be avoided from the conspiracy of the truth, but it was not executed properly.
Bal Yon Professional University of Griffith, professor Stephen Smalbon, said that when Jonathan Lard was working between 2099 and 2011, he was not a safe organization.
He said that the appointment of employees, investigation, access, training, and environment was "great problems".

The C.T. is primarily computing the solutions, but Mr. Osburn is waiting for the final decision, which in the year 2012, has more than 2 Million pounds, and people who prefer to stay home in a company than a peripheral person, for 7 percent of the stamp dutty was present at the rate.
In 2012/13 the Westminster and Cansington and Patmos were 708 miles [78 km] from the cities of the city, which were already more than the North Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and South America.
Mr. Kuke said: "It is very difficult to argue that the high-value proposal is at least a tax on the proposal, which does not have any connection with the effect of the oldest surveillance system.
He added, "but this step can make some of the foreign investigators in buying property in London and selling the current survival."
According to the value of the house market in Prime Property, in the suburbs southwest London, the last year the record increases 11.8 percent of the house market's top 5 to 10 percent, which has been expanded from Flum to Wimbaldon.
According to Savil’s discovery, every year the regular growth of Central London's values increased by 5.6 percent every year, but growing up seemed to be less than the "Holololobo’s market", since the city's southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent).
The scientists have also revealed how the dog's tail works and his brain are related to the matter.
The previous discoveries have shown that the happy dogs sweep their double on the right (between the dog), while the chicks sweep their back on the left.
But scientists now say that cock dogs can identify this complex secret and express their reaction on it.
This study has been published in journal Colont bilozi.
From the University of Trento, Newrosinist Professor Georgea Wellertigara said: "Man knows all that is best that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in a different way in which positive or negative emotions are produced."
Here we try to see it in other people.
He said that like men, the right part of the brain was responsible for the actions of the left hand, and the opposite order, and two controversial roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the other dogs, researchers looked at other dogs' movies.
They measured the hearts of the Paltu dogs, and analyzed their behavior.
We probably don't take too much time to understand why their double is sometimes moving toward the other side.
Pro. Vellertigara said: "We presented dogs with the films of dogs - in a photograph to deal with the logical version or with other issues, and we could see the tail's action, and we could present the back to the left or to the left."
And when the beasts saw a creeping dog walking by his right hand, they were full of rest.
But when they saw the fish turn aside, and turn to the left, their heart was lifted up, and they were troubled.
According to Pro. Wellertigara, they don't think that dogs were deliberately talking to each other through these actions.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience what they should be concerned about and what they should not do.
They said: "If you meet other dogs many times, and if they turn their back on one side, it is more friendly, and the right part of the right is less friendly, you are responding to the same experience."
According to researchers, these conclusions can provide better information about the feelings of animals, the owners, the animals, and the teachers.
Professor John Bradshaw of the University of Bristol of Veterniary Syncisure, professor of dogs' behavior, said that this is not the first study to test whether dogs are important to the left or to the right.
Last year at the University of Lincoln, the team found that when dogs see a smart dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the happy dog to the right.
In other research in Canada's University of Victoria, he said: "In contrast with the Illustration study - when the dog's tail was moved to the left, it was more likely that the dogs were not distracted than the dogs."
He said that this was the distance because the dogs in various studies were not fully aware of animals or robots dogs.
They explained that it can help study the way to respond to the real dogs by dogs.
"When various Studies have shown a lot of evidence that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, the more detailed information is still available-- and the dogs are not exceptional in this case," he said.
However, the easy way their behavior can be put in, it seems that we will probably not take too much time to understand why their double moves to the other side.
Alex Turner’s disease caused arctic monkeys to suspend glasgo gig
Rock Bank, an Arctic Mance, has suspended gig in Glasgow after his chief singer's painting.

Pope Frances will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will create a new cardinal for the first time in his workday.
Cardinals, the Catholic Church, are the clergy of the highest classes, their position is only below the pope, and they choose the pope, so Frances will relocate the first group of their people, who will eventually help them to choose their inheritance.
Now there's a total of 200 cardinals.
In the same way, after the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to share in the election of the pope - it comes into the 120 "Cardinal Chooser" group.
In a time of proclaiming the news, Vatican's Prime Minister Fadriko Lombbardy said that before the new cardinals were promoted, all present cardinals will be held together, which is called the Pope-same.
Lombardi said, "Pop Francis has already decided to make his decision to organize the pope's decision in February, so that it would be easier to make other meetings of cardinals shared in the world."
Jake Valeero of Catholic Voices said that it was possible to reduce the number of cardinal selectors until February.
He said that Pope normally, the number of cardinal chooser is less than 120, as well as the names of cardinals, and more than 80 years of age, according to his will.
Wellero said that the next year's pope's meeting will be important, because this year it will be the first pope's party after the French was selected in March.
Currently there is a form of prejudice against Europe and Italy.
He said, "It's interesting to see if new popes in order to establish balances, even cardinals from the rest of the world.
In South America there are about 40 percent of Roman Catholics, but their number is very small in Cardinals.
The first cardinals will be selected after the censorship of the cardinals, which is a group of eight cardinals around the world, which are to be searched for ways to improve the church.
Before the pope decided everything himself.
Valero said, "But Frances has still chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said that it's "possible" to ask the French cardinals for advice.
But we're not first in this situation - it's really new.
Wellero said that Pope usually gives the bishop of the largest places a cardinal, but Frances were "astonishing all - so we don't know whose name they will call."
Calling the packup trucks back in US to correct the seatback
On Friday, according to an information from the U.S. Auto security agents, General Motors Company, called for nearly 19,000 trucks to correct a lack of cigarettes in his new 2014 Shelverla Silverado and GMCP trucks.
In some trucks, a lack of freight seats can be rotated in the system.
As a result, locateback failed to follow the organization on auto security standards about Head Restant.
According to a information on the National Rajway Road Security Administration, "If the drive falls back, it is likely that the head is not safe enough to protect the driver, which will increase the risk."
The models called back were created between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM truck was launched in June 2009, and it represents the most important thing for the top U.S. automaker after the venue.

GM was sold in October 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra Pikup truck.
On Friday afternoon in New York Stack Exchange, there was 1.4 percent in the GM's shade.
Obama’s Advocates ’ Depression
I gave Obama twice to change
They say Obama's great efforts have been blocked because of the policy of the GOP.
The policy of the obamakeer website can't offer drone attacks
Obama, 2008 Campaign, reminds us of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris Harvard Medical School is two-year-old students.
I'm reading very painful books today.
This is a book about which I think this second year will enthusiasm for me and raise hopes in me.
The name is "the courage to win," and it is a consumption of the presidential election campaign in Berak Obama in 2008.
When I find my patients in the nights and go to bed, this book takes me to a time in which millions of people were inspired by politics and the talks could stop your breath.
The elections proved to be disastrous, and the news speakers took a break to show the historical significance of that time.
The eyes of my fellows were joyous, and my parents saved every good news.
A group of young people was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008 they had 82% of authorization ratings during Obama's president.
And then I closed the book.
Now the truth of the present is a harsh truth, as the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they believe a distance, a painful memory of the losses.
I've really changed since I've been killed for the first time.
I couldn't even imagine any of this.
I give Obama a lot of credit to accommodations, from Afrdebel Keer Ecuador to Iraq, to the end of Osama Bin Laden, to the end of "Don't tell me," and to the death of Osama Bin Laden.
I also believe that the policy of partial opposition has prevented many efforts to advance our country, including foreign reforms, public options for health services, shutting off the egg on the Guvantanmo Bay, and others.
But the number of times I've taken my own side of the Obama Administration and my colleagues-- the answer ends to me so that I can give them.
I've reached the point of political despair.
The opposing policy of Republic is not the answer of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to dron attacks in foreign countries.
This national security agency cannot answer the facts about the personal life of the American citizens, nor can it be answered to act on those who make mistakes by the government.
It can't tell the reason for the murder of the American citizen Unver El Alaki, without a train, nor the public charges and the restrictions of the presidential campon.
It can't answer the conclusions of the report, which says that the effort by the White House to silence the media has been "the most conservative since the Nixon Administration."
And most recently, it can't offer a simple website to design a failure after three years of signed by the Afroidbel Cayer Ecut.
I don't know if I expected it.
If, in 18 years of age, I had to figure out that the government system could break the political campaign to bring it forward.
It is obvious that the official office is not a preliminary way, because opposition political teams and memorable events, such as Newtown murder, will shape our public discussion.
Nevertheless, the above examples I have set are mostly of those chosen by the Administration.
It's the most disturbing of you.
I revotted back for Obama in 2012, but because I wasn't happy with his expectations.
Mit Romani presents a misleading and unconscious option that seems not to be certain of their policy or position.
I thought another workday for Obama, which will be free from the pressures of future choices, will fulfill the hopes we have heard for long time.
Nevertheless, while Obama's rating is less than 45% of the week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008 through that book.
I remember their failing promises when I see him.
This week he was reading a part of the book, described as how Clinton did not suffer a great loss because of Obama in Pennsylvania Primeri.
In a post-martment camping meeting, he told his slaves that they needed to return to the street, and needed to be loyal to their purposes.
He said, "I want to get my measure back."
We should remember who we are.'
I can't agree with you more than five years later, Mr. President.

Vriver Tradeer said that even though the large amount of foreign currency is incredibly large incorporated by the Crete, the use of Liquididity between different-trading platforms and their own platforms means "You can start to affect the market on a small ticket value."
The news came on the same day, on the day Cradet Suis announced to the trainer from his Exchange Trades Desk in London this week, who lost about 6 million in the end of the last year.
Bank immediately informed the authorities and supported with his disposers.

A sinner that is rich shall not be rich, neither shall any man be able to profit.
Don't envy someone else if he has wealth.

It would also be your health, personality, love for others.

Khan, responsible for this, said that their security has been removed because of political reasons.
It seems that SPE's ticket on the PDP's ticket in 2002 was part of their mission as free Mohammad Said Prime Minister.
The slave Hasan Khan said I've got security cover since 1996.
I dwell in the rocks of the terrors.
A security account of CRPF at my house was Tanat's leader of all the inspectors.
I'm also with the bodyguards, but the armed man was suddenly taken back my security.
When the security was gone from my house, I spoke to Die Jai Socrate and Jay SP.
But rather than reestablish security, they just said they would check this case.
However, in this context, when the IGP Abdul Ghani Mir of Kashmir was contacted, they refused the information that this case is sensitive.
I'm going to test myself how a former monster and the security of the state leader has been removed.
Province Congress Pr. Safudin Soz said that there's nothing like that in my information.

I'm coming to Kashmir in the next two days.
I'll discuss this issue with the administration.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent 85 million money in the past four years to celebrate the presidential power of Peel.
Rather, during the eruption of NDA in contrast with Modi’s claims (between 1999 and 2004), a period of time came when no announcement was issued by the government for a period of two years (2001-2002).
On Thursday, the modifier of the 182 feet [182 m] high in the Gujarat of Kwadia, said, ‘It wasn't the first time that the president of the Palestine had no advertisement at the moment.
While DVP records show that UPA spent 30 million in 2009-10, in 2010-11 4.10 million money, 2.7 million $2.7 million in 2011-12, and 1.4 million in 2012-13.
When the central information and broadcasts were asked about Modi's teeth from Mannish Tirar, they said that BBP's PM Canada does not speak on the basis of facts.
The UPA year did not bring any advertisements on the table in 2008.
It was because of the economic crisis that same year.
However, the amount of money that was spent on Palestine's advertisements is less than the amount of money spent on members of the Gandhi family's genetics and retirement.
DAVP spent $9.38 million for the genetic and physics of Mahatma Gandhi, 21 million for the East Pym Rajj Gandhi, 145 million for the Indira Gandhi, and 938 million of the Red Navigators.
When Manifest asked the question of the distance, they said, 'It should not be seen by the expense on the advertisement.
Because the price of the advertisement depends on many things, including the size of the advertisement or the rating of the advertisement for that year.
The fact is that this shows our dedication, which the opponents are trying to handle the heritage of a great leader without knowing it.

Walking by earth, rivers, and forests in order to provide free medical service
Dr. Georges Well, Cameroon, free health service
Well and his team see hundreds of diseases every week
There is no more medical in West African countries; there is only one medical for 5000 people.
Give your vote here or the mobile.
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 leaders of the CNN in 2013.
You can vote for them or on other top 10 to anyone to make a leader of CNN year.
The winner will get 250,000 dollars to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well saw his sick father coming to Hosh, in a hospital, going to the hospital, which was not suitable to help them.
Jamel Well, in 1981, the car crashed near Cameroon's capital, Yode.
They had only broken their hands at the beginning, but a surgeon spread to their brain, and he made blood-starbuds, which affected their lives.
Georges Well says, "There was no navy in Cameroon."
If we had money, we would have brought our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well took his father with a large crowd of clinic and hospitals full of clinics and hospitals and received whatever treatment they could get.
Well said, "It's not easy."
You get out of home at 5:00 a.m. that you're the first person you're going to come to the hospital, but that doesn't happen.
There are many sick people there.
Some may be waiting in the face of death.
Well's father died in 2002 has not changed much in the situation.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5000 people in Cameroon.
If you compare, the United States has a doctor for every 413 people.
And even if there's medical, many residents of Cameroon can't spend her money.
Two of the five live in the country under poverty, and about two thirds of health services in the country are private.
Well says, "their only problem is poverty."
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their life.
And when he saw the affliction of his father, and of his people, he was determined to comfort it.
Dr. Georges and volunteers' team have done 700 free medical treatment last year.
They also became doctors, and they worked as a vacular surgery in the Central Hospital of UND.
And they started in Escowim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical service.
Since 2008, they and their own crew have helped some 32,000 people.
nearly every Friday they and about 30 people sit in the van, the doctors tied up with the hospital and go to village areas where people need medical care.
Never get kind of with them.
They have to push the vehicle from rivers and dust.
But when they arrive, they really receive the honor of the leaders: the best holiday that can be brought by the community.
In these villages, free medical service is really a cause for survival, and Well - with their great smile and endless energy - it is happy.
Their team starts meeting hundreds of patients the next morning.
Well said, "We're meeting 500 people in every journey."
They come from the village about 60 kilometers, and they walk.
All these weekends provide different antibiotics.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, infectious diseases, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get boss, gifts, or free birth certificates -- the need for this document is in university, but many poor families can't spend it.
In the evening, the team gets a simplified sympathy with local analysis.
Operations are usually done at school's houses, tour halls, or home; after processing, the disease goes to the restaurant place, and builds a place for the next person.
The generator of the group publishs in the rooms and the sensitization tools, and they work on the mornings and their own Sundays.
It's a commodity speed, but the musicians of the village usually help keep the team inspiration.
Well said, "They play the Drum all night to keep us alive and to continue their work."
On Sunday their team returns to the city, they're tired, but they're proud of their work.
This group, including Cameroon's medical and foreign medical students, has been medicalized for the past year 700 free - and they know that their help can change the world of those they help.
One man said he would be able to go back to work because he received free Herniya health.
He said: This will change the future of me and my family.
Besides running clinic in weekends and working as a salu-chietic in the hospital, they also work on private medical clinic around UND at night.
He said that this is his second job that contributes to 60% of his non-profit work; the other part is full of personal contributions.
The second year of Draxel University in Philadelphia said, "I don't know when they are sleeping."
They're always in the hospital, or they're trying to earn money for their organization, so they're running these campaigns.
This is an industrial opportunity for those who come from the United States and Europe to join the campaign, such as O'Mali and nurses, who can never get in their country.
O'Mali said, "In the medical medical we help to hold the tools for Dr. Wail or clean the blood plasma, we are able to find practical experience."
You will never be able to do that as a second-year-old medical student in the United States.
Self-survival students usually use their own to reach Cameroon, and they often come with gifts medical professionals.
But after the UN arrives, they live in Ana-known, and the cost of directions.
O'Mali says, "There's no doubt they're hero."
They give their life for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
For Well, almost one kind of work, it's not difficult.
to help others to live a happy life, to fulfill the promise of their father, which gives them great joy.
Well says, "I'm so happy to do this."
And I think of my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to laugh people, to reduce their pain.
