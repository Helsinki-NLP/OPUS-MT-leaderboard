A rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom which confirms that, although the stages vary depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase its readiness for a surge in COVID-19 patients who will need health care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent of the disease is a new coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, namely a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease and requires hospital care, while the other 6% of cases experience critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalized as a result of COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study, we looked at the cumulative incidence trends of COVID-19 in European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to incidents in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 experienced further geographical spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world currently following the dynamics of the pandemic in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 issue of March 5, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with confirmed COVID-19 cases based on WHO case definitions.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 on people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected across 30 EU/EEA and United Kingdom (UK) countries, between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 with that date including, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidences of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases notified each country around the world is updated daily at 8:00 p.m. This number is obtained only from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and UK, as well as compare them to trends in Italy.
As the prevalence proxy of active COVID-19 cases, we calculate the cumulative incidence of decapitated 14 days, so take into account the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK countries, in the period of 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases notified by each country until 15 March 2020 at 8.00 am compared to the Italian case during the period 31 January – 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
The cumulative incident trend of decapitated 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21, then rose sharply around February 28, 2020 (Additional material).
The trend is primarily driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar trend in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (Additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data highlights that, as of March 15 at 8:00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and UK.
The trend observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 signals that the pandemic is increasing at a comparable pace in all countries.
This is despite the stage differences experienced by countries, the variation in public health response, and the possible differences in case definitions between countries and the differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region explained the situation of about 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA levels are only available for 6% and 1% of cases (data not shown).
However, data should be collected in a systematic way to supplement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and mortality rates.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 showed large variations in the availability of intensive care beds and midwifery in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or fewer resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and midwifery care per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The modelling scenario related to the saturation of health care capacity, with estimates of the prevalence of inpatient COVID-19 cases for each EU/EEA and UK countries related to risk <0x3E>90% beyond intensive care bed capacity, is provided at the sixth update of ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since so far cases have been reported in certain regions of the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve specific regional service coverage populations, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the Regional Unit Nomination level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very fast in the EU/EEA and UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, particularly intensive care, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As demonstrated in the ECDC’s recent rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive, and comprehensive approach is critical to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the transition from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept, and adapt the appropriate response if it is not implemented before.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity as the country has the possibility to further increase its control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EEA state health care system is likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more contagious and more about the elderly than young people, as well as more in men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on this emerging disease, this article tries to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the subject of fast-growing research.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
While there are still many unanswered questions, we hope this review helps with the understanding and eradication of this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were ordered to stay home during the holidays and a few weeks after due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease it caused was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients repatriated and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy” and potentially more destructive than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that established isolated viral sequences of some patients, more than 200 papers have been published about COVID-19, which includes its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review seeks to summarize research progress in this fast-growing new subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-induced diseases, namely Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been learned so far regarding the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some other unanswered, but urgent, questions.
According to tradition, CoV is considered a nonlethal pathogen for humans, primarily causing about 15% of colds.
However, in this century, we have encountered a highly pathogenic CoV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Because of this, COVID-19 is currently the third outbreak of CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr 1.1, a pneumonia cluster of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, a health care provider's infection was reported, which hinted that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, a regional quarantine was imposed in the city of Wuhan and all public transport was halted.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market were considered the initial site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had already spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).
Since the situation is developing very quickly, the final coverage and severity of the outbreak must still be established.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study on 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more updated picture of the following epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but especially at ages 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people are over 50 years of age, only a few are under 20 years of age, and only 14 are infected who are under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is widespread in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the customized R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, corresponding to the time of mass transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the customized mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large, enveloped viral subfamily containing a single strand of RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
The glycoprotein bulge or spike (S) envelope binds to its cell receptor, the enzyme angiotensin exchanger 2 (ACE 2) and dipeptide peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA is accompanied by a cover glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid protein forms a vesicle containing the virion, which then undergoes fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98% among the 10 samples sequenced; the sample was taken from the outbreak's original location, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles are found in the very thin epithelium of the human airway.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as was SARS-CoV.
However, the human S SARS-CoV-2 protein binds to ACE2 weaker than it binds to the S SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are not as severe as SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded with orf3b and a protein secreted with an orf8 password.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b protein may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported a complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in complex with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has an open and closed conformation, is arranged to form a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which is evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be used as a therapeutic target in filtering drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Mother of origin and intermediaries
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from bats and each is transmitted to humans through weasels and camels.
Through the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-like CoVs of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helps the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans is still unknown, and the route of transmission remains to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed snakes as carriers of viruses from bats to humans involving homologous recombination within S proteins.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that pangolins, long-necked ant-eater mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine, potentially as intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology in CoV found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread throughout the genome is still a large difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence are still not obtained (Gbr. 3).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, disinfectants containing chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, effectively disabled the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies reporting on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other previous CoV studies, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
In general, after invading the host, the virus is recognized by the innate immune system through pattern recognition receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, viruses induce the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and synthesis of type I interferon (IFN) which limits the spread of viruses and accelerates phagocytosis of viral antigens by macrophages.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid the immune response.
Not long after, the adaptive immune response joined the battle against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from cured patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce large amounts of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst case scenario, failure of the compound organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by an early cluster, is more concerning the elderly with concomitant diseases and pregnant women.
Generally, people who are exposed to a large amount of the virus or whose immune function is impaired have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as described above, show that the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent an infected person, but without symptoms, transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to the virus or infected are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a major and early symptom of COVID-19, with or without accompanying other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, gaul, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the progression of the patient's disease progresses rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary imaging disorders, should be screened against the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilator support.
A similar finding was reported in two recent studies, namely studies on family clusters and clusters caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had a fever (98%), a dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients require ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher MERS lethality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) are shown as the main symptoms and ventilation support is needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 is given in Table 1.
The figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capability than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as lethal as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than that of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Cluster accompaniments are often found in one family or from a group or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact an infected person or patient in the last two weeks before the onset.
However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who are discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again. This raises alertness to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages, the patient has a normal or decreased count of peripheral white blood cells (specifically lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, which includes the lymphocyte count <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and elevated levels of aminotransferase aspartate as well as viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes as well as myoglobin increased in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive protein and blood deposit rate increased in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels increase, i.e. fibrin decomposition products present in the blood, and lymphocyte counts decrease progressively.
Torque photo abnormalities are found in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral cloudy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly aggravate gas exchange disorders.
Pneumocyte dysfunctions of type I and type II decrease surfactant levels and increase surface pressure thereby decreasing the ability of the lungs to expand and increase the risk of lung collapse.
Because of this, the worst findings in thoracic photos are often parallel to the most severe rates of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of hyalin membranes, and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as synsitial cells in the lungs of patients who died of this disease, in accordance with the pathologies of viral infection and ARDS as well as similar to the pathological analyses of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high levels of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurs with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and a must to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group explained the protocol of using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without requiring complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and ease if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors primarily offer supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying various previously used or proposed therapies for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential therapies with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from cured patients is proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 in lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are major threats to the patient and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential for relieving symptoms and saving lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, electrolyte balance care, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protection of vital organ function are also very important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to result in cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storms are a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, which include TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals that are the main causes of ARDS and compound organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storms include modulation of T-cell-directed immune responses; blocking IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppression 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are not useful for heavy lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
In contrast, steroids can result in severe side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which greatly affects the prognosis.
However, short-term administration of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses is recommended to be given with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be beneficial in a COVID-19 patient from America.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed an inhibition against other single-stranded RNA viruses, which included MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided this compound for China to conduct a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results were highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other drugs used by the patient should be closely monitored.
Plasma from a cured patient and the manufacture of antibodies
There is a long history of collecting the blood of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting the disease.
Indeed, cured patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) that B lymphocytes produce to fight pathogens as well as other foreign bodies, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had already recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammation and viral load as well as increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification need to be done to submit the method for large-scale use before specific therapy is developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some deficiencies related to plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overestimate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and plasma is needed in large quantities to treat critically ill patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or perform effective antibody filtering against proteins that are important to viruses.
In this way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect largely depends on the combination of the various components in the formula. This formula varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify those components or their optimal combination.
Currently, because effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 do not yet exist, TCM is one of the major alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The top cure rates in COVID-19 patient therapy were observed in some Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% of its patients, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rates (13%).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of the patient, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues formulated a study comparing western drug therapy (WM) alone with combined WM and TCM therapies.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, symptom loss, and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
More impressively, the rate of symptom poaching (from mild to severe) was much lower for the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and lower mortality in the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, TCM’s efficacy and safety are still waiting for better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the mechanism of work and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most patients suspected or confirmed of COVID-19 feel very frightened of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and quarantined people also feel boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as therapeutic side effects such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia can cause greater anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which included depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor turmoil, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suisidality were once reported.
Tracking contact history and mandatory quarantines, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and feel guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, and people in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapeutic plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for breaking the transmission chain of infected animal and human reservoirs to vulnerable hosts and often complement antiviral therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by the emergence of the virus.
Efforts have been made to develop an S-protein-based vaccine, which in the long run and effectively creates neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live-weakened vaccines have been evaluated in experimental animals.
However, the efficacy of this vaccine candidate in the elderly and its models of lethal challenges and protection against zoonotic virus infection remains to be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS subsided 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions as zoonotic sources continue to exist in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using decommissioned viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and have been partially evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easily overcome due to the long time to develop a vaccine (average 18 months) and dynamic variations of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show its full clinical journey to thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can gradually recover without a sequel.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the establishment of a disease prognosis model is very important for the health care body to prioritize its services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurred in the ages of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients aged over 50 in the study containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who require intensive care tend to have comorbidities and complications and are significantly older than patients who do not need intensive care (median age 66 years than 51 years), which indicates age as a prognostic factor for the final outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to have acute heart injury and arrhythmias.
Heart events also account for the main cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to also be able to bind to colangiocytes with ACE2-positive, which can result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that the age and underlying diseases are highly correlated and can affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammatory or tissue injury and are proposed as potential prognostic factors for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
A correlation between CRP levels and the severity as well as the prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the final outcome.
These enzymes are expressed very highly in various organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Primary clinical symptoms: Photos of the thorax and the development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other things to predict the final outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are widely used as support therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many people who have survived the disease end up suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and short periods of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffer tremendous stress as they have to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be given to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or symptomless symptoms in the initial phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, in the initial phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which creates great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when the patient is seriously ill and most do not occur in the initial phase.
As such, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
At present, major efforts are being made in China, which includes the quarantine of the Wuhan region and surrounding cities as well as the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of cutting off the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While this action is particularly damaging to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, which indicates a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate states the outbreak will end in March and the phase of decline lasts 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. created a model to predict the final outcome of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a mid-concave swab and throat of patients who had recovered and returned home from hospital 2 weeks earlier. This indicates that the re-identified virus can be a recurring episode, similar to influenza.
However, promising signs occur in China, when viewed based on declining numbers of new cases, suggesting that the current strategy may work.
Ebola is predicted to cause one million cases with half as many deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Perhaps also, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that can coexist with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic is given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also be through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in the feces, giving rise to the possibility of a new transmission, namely fecal-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by a nosocomial infection, which includes 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions should be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, and even people who happen to be in contact with a patient or an infected person.
The first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of infection was through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series number 1860s) helping control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks keep the potentially infected person's saliva splashing out of the air or sticking to the surface of the material, where the spit can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (the 1860s serial number) can protect against inhalation of virions with sizes as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can be fully magnetized; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both of which are about 85 nm in size.
Because particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, health care providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series number 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate isolation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may enter his body through eye inflammation.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear translucent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in the affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended for everyone to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay home for self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
The distance of three feet is believed to be appropriate to keep the distance from the patient.
These measures are an effective method to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus to the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a major warning to China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control calmed the population by saying that the new virus has low spread properties and limited human-to-human reproductive capacity and prevention and containment of the disease is not a problem.
This message is very soothing to the public’s fears, especially as the entire country is preparing for the Spring Festival, so this critical time is too late to stem the still small-scale disease in Wuhan.
The disease control agency in China should take lessons from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is noticed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from the clinic than wait for official reports from doctors or authorized officers; (3) be more restrictive to stem the potential of the epidemic at an early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) be more often issued targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the epidemic of the disease and test and improve the public response system on a periodic basis.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to spread in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, the outbreak has spread across China and over 50 countries in the world at the time of writing this review.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, the COVID-19 outbreak gives the impression that the SARS outbreak is repeated.
However, there are some obvious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for stemming the epidemic and dealing with patients.
COVID-19 is more about the elderly than young people and more about men than women, and the mortality rate is also higher in the elderly than in young people.
SARS mortality is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomless, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill. This makes it more difficult to stem the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part the reason SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA assays to check for SARS-CoV-2 can have negative outcomes in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered can give yet another positive result to the examination of the virus.
These findings greatly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important issues still have to be solved, namely:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a genetic homology of 96% was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-CoVs, we are still unable to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal is the intermediate species for transmitting viruses from the original host, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers number 1 and 2, we cannot effectively disconnect the transmission and the outbreak can re-spread at any time.
While molecular modeling and biochemical assays show that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the airway cells and result in subsequent pathological changes?
Does this virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis as well as effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How do viruses develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic be a worldwide pandemic, ending like SARS, or recurring periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
Regardless of the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
Zoonotic origin of human coronavirus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its hosts, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as colds.
An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and reveals how HCoV infection can be very damaging and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has made CoV a highlight again and surprises us with high transmission, but with lower pathogenicity than its brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic. Therefore, understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoV will benefit us.
Most HCoVs come from bats. In these animals, the virus is not pathogenic.
An intermediate reservoir host of several HCoVs has also been known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
An investigation of CoV-inang interactions in animals can also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present a general overview of the current knowledge of the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of its discovery as well as its zoonotic origin and its interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compared and contrasted the HCoV from an evolutionary point of view and genome recombination.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host switching and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
The corona virus (CoV) comes from the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of enveloped, positively charged, single-stranded RNA viruses.
The virus has the largest genome with a size of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called "CoV", due to its crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that has a similar arrangement.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that overlap each other. Both are translated into polyprotein replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins undergo further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which include a bulge or spike (S), a sheath or envelope (E), a membrane (M), and a nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complementary proteins specific to a particular lineage are also encoded by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoV is classified into four genera (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four genera, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoV and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while poultry are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continuously crossed the species barrier and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and have a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the pulmonary organs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the snot of a cold patient in the mid 1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is generally harmless, until an outbreak of SARS occurs.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most destructive outbreaks in history today, infecting more than 8,000 people with a rough death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
The new HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), further called SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins from bats, rats, or pets.
Much evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats. In bats, CoV is well adapted and is nonpathogenic, but shows great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
The tracking of the zoonotic origin of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and limiting factors of displacement between species.
The study may also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir animal hosts, intermediates, and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which have important implications in the prevention of future spread.
In this review, we provide an overview of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV pathogenesis.
We specifically highlight and discuss the common topic that HCoV parent viruses are usually nonpathogenic in their natural reservoirs, but become pathogenic after transmission of interspecies to a new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoV that the increase in transmission capabilities is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The final results of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic are also discussed in this context.
Animal coV has been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of the first HCoV-229E strain B814 from the snot of cold-affected patients, various CoVs had been isolated from various infected animals, which included turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative clue.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the airway of patients who had an upper airway infection in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to be grown in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed symptoms of colds, which included headaches, sneezing, lethargy, and sore throats, accompanied by fever and cough seen in 10-20% of cases.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and sequenced series pathways in the still-feeding brain.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to an infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogenic infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread all over the world and tend to be most widely transmitted during winter in temperate regions.
Usually, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week and followed by a period of illness for about 2 weeks.
Based on a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced mild colds.
Few patients with weakened immune systems show severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent was SARS-CoV, which was the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, which were spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from superinfectants, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and peak viral load seen on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headaches, fever, lethargy, and chills, which are followed by dyspnea, coughing, and breath disorders as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased creatine kinases are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Damage to alveolar diffusion, proliferation of epithelial cells, and increased macrophages were also observed in SARS patients.
Furthermore, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be deadly, particularly in patients whose immunity is weak.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of relatives of zero patients who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus is initially very prevalent in young children, the elderly, and patients with weak immunity who suffer from respiratory diseases.
Images of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are commonly found in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the same virus isolation from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and peaks occur in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called krup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma exacerbations.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
These four HCoV communities have entirely adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases. However, exceptional cases do occur for unknown reasons, as in the case of more virulent HCoV-NL63 subtypes that have recently been reported to cause severe lower airway infections in China.
Generally, when it gets the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend itself within humans, this virulence and pathogenicity of HCoV is also reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, cases of imports with occasional secondary spread to close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to the clinical manifestations of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which so far only occurs in MERS among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30% of patients exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the scariest viruses known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the ongoing outbreak of lower airway infections and is caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency as well as naming the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross case death rate of 3.4%.
Note, case deaths in Hubei, China, were 4.2%, while case deaths outside Hubei were 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with images of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the heaviest symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their high nucleotide sequence homology, at 82%, they both group into different branches of phylogenetic trees.
The pathogonisity of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms have been reported and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows a general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture seen in Community HCoV infection, which includes an overview of mild or even symptomless nonspecific symptoms.
On the other hand, a small percentage of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infection even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting pattern characteristics, having similarities to both community HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission capability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the HCoV community.
On the other hand, declining transmission capabilities of SARS-CoV-2 after some pathways in humans still need to be verified, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from fecal samples.
"Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, it should still be clarified by subsequent studies."
What is also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of community HCoV.
However, the picture of SARS-CoV-2, which includes the ability to transmit, pathogenicity, and sustained spread in multiple pathways in humans, will have a profound effect on the fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four HCoV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
Viewed from another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may have been species of survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoV that causes severe disease in humans and humans who have severe HCoV disease has been destroyed.
For this to happen, HCoV must replicate in humans in sufficient quantities to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations to counteract host restriction factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people infected, the more likely it is that the virus is fully adaptable to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission in humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community CoVs circulated in the human population and triggered colds in immunocompetent people.
The virus does not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans and their transmission in humans is untenable.
Both must defend themselves and reproduce in zoonotic reservoirs as well as look for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has an image similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted like community HCoV, at least today.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoV and is not as pathogenic as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary hosts, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and HCoV amplifiers.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoV if they have closely related ancestors and share a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus usually adapts well and is nonpathogenic in this host.
Similarly, reservoir hosts carry HCoV continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is infected naturally and is a natural host for HCoV or the parent virus.
Conversely, if a new HCoV enters an intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters a human, the virus has not adapted to a new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate mother can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplification host by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoV can develop a dead end infection if it is unable to maintain its transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the host of the natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data reveal retrospectively that zero cases of SARS have a history of contact with a game animal.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies indicated that the seller had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
The lunar weasel (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market were the first to be identified carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that is nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS have been reported since all the ferrets in the market were killed.
However, it is reported that moon weasels from the wild or unexploded farms to the live animal market have largely yielded negative test results for SARS-CoV, suggesting that moon weasels may only act as intermediate amplification hosts, but not natural SARS-CoV resorvoir.
It should be noted, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that probably many small mammalian species also serve as the intermediate amplification hosts of SARS-CoV.
All of these hosts appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
A natural animal host search for SARS-CoV further revealed a closely related bat CoV, called the Rhinolopus bat CoV relative-SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
This bat provides positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequences.
This CoV and other CoV bats share an 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
The study became the foundation for a new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) were also identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, could be isolated as a living virus.
Angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from a bat fecal sample was shown using ACE2 bats, ferrets, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, convalescent SARS patient serum can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, with a nucleotide sequence homology of 95%.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus SARS-CoV and bats are not the direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptide peptidase 4 (DPP4), as an entry point for the virus.
The sequence of RNA-dependent polymerase MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to its counterpart in the identified bat beta-CoV from Europe and Africa.
To date, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Because of this, bats may not host direct reservoirs of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab camels give seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like camels of Middle Eastern origin in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus found in humans isolated from the nasal swab of the Arab camel. This further indicates that the camel is the actual reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral decay with usually mild symptoms is observed in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted, the infected camel sheds the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of viral decay from bats.
However, questions remain unanswered as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with the RaTG13 bat CoV isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bat.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to establish a parent relationship.
In other words, bats may not host a direct reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, unless an almost identical bat CoV is found later on.
Likely, the intermediate animal host SARS-CoV-2 exists among species of wildlife sold and killed in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 are related to this market, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequences suggest that a group of endangered small mammals, known as pangolins (Manis javanica), may also carry ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
This new pangolin CoV genome shares 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
The two are grouped into two subline-derived SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in phylogenetic trees, one sharing a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4%.
Significantly, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much different, although the homology levels of whole genome sequences are higher.
Previous studies on ill pangolins also reported detection of viral contig from lung samples, which turned out to be also related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different drafting methods and manual curation to produce a partial genome sequence consisting of about 86.3% of the complete viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility of pangolins as one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from pangolins due to sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals remains to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology in RBD is found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology at the sequence level of the entire genome.
It is overly speculative if it is said that the high level of similarity between the RBD beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 trending and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by convergent evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
The counter hypothesis supports the recombination between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 pangolins and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving factor, many recombinations occur among beta-CoVs.
Researchers have yet to decide on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoV, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in a North American three-colour bat showed a close kinship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to other bat CoVs, under the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae thought to also be its intermediate host.
To be clearer, the current knowledge of the origin of the known HCoV animals is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the incidence of transmission between HCoV species in history.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 passed species from livestock to infect humans, there was a pandemic of respiratory infections.
The transmission history of HCoV-229E interspecies is not very clear.
Alfa-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between the two, there is alpha-CoV alpaka.
Some evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may come into contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E exist assorted and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoVs cause an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Lastly, alpha-CoV alpakas are not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas getting alpha-CoV relative-HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source for human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility, while bat alpha-CoV serves as a laxative of the HCoV-229E gene, alpaka and Arab camels may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example for the transmission of interspecies from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in early identification of the virus and is also corroborated by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats are a rich lung of viral species for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and transmission between species.
Long lifespans, closely arranged colonies, close social interactions, and strong flying ability, are all supportive conditions for bats to become the ideal 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arabian camel for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have changed from intermediate hosts to stable and natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans happens by chance and humans remain the final host for MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of the camel in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of trengiling, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Primarily, beta-CoV trengiling is highly pathogenic in trengiling.
The swallow may be the final host for the beta-CoV relative SARS-CoV-2, similar to the weasel in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animals to humans should be taken into account or ruled out.
First, bats could have been a reservoir host for a SARS-CoV-2 relative virus that is nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological niches with bats through slaughtering or coal mining.
Secondly, trengling could have been one of the intermediate amplification hosts for the newly-incoming SARS-CoV-2 relative virus.
Humans get the virus through the slaughter and consumption of manure.
It is possible that many mammals, which include pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody surveys of pets and wild animals need to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in third species in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, the three main factors from the side of the virus are also important for making it easier for CoV to cross the species barrier.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CoV mutations can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 per year per site, depending on the CoV adaptation phase of the new host.
CoV has an exoribonuclease repair, removal that results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog of Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through the inhibition of this exoribunuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of CoV mutations is about a million times higher than the rate of mutations of the host.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoV has not adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is actually lower, signaling a higher rate of adaptation with humans.
Likely, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV which has adapted to the Arabian camel.
Theoretically, it is less likely that genetic drift will quickly make vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the probability of co-evolution between species, which is favorable for the emergence of new CoV when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by the many unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the genome.
Thirdly, CoVs often change templates randomly during RNA replication through a unique "select-copy" mechanism.
In hosts that serve as mixing containers, strand transitions often occur during transcription of CoV RNA.
Complete RNA and highly homologous subgenomics can undergo recombination to form a new CoV.
Natural recombination phylogenetic evidence has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus-internal interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the virus' interaction with the host receptor is another major factor affecting transmission between species.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during the occurrence of interspecies transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolates and weasels, SARS-CoV is suspected of rapid adaptation in various hosts, particularly with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and intensively becomes the target of a host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its choreceptor as the viral entryway.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, ferrets, mice, and raccoons, thus allowing transmission of viruses between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to differ between human viral isolates and weasels in RBD and 4 of them were located in receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV weasels have K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of bulge protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be crucial for viral adaptation to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein S unit implies the binding affinity of S protein to human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed the binding affinity of human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV-2 proteins 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV proteins.
What is also important to know is whether any other choreceptors may be needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with different parts on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-teracetylated for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after interspecies transmission from its animal host.
In addition to cell receptors, the final result of transmission of HCoVs between species is also regulated by other host dependency and restriction factors.
These differences in host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arab camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoV must take over the host dependency factor and break into the host restriction factor in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular determinants in this important field of viral-mothering interaction must still be identified and characterized.
Filtering the entire genome unbiased to look at the dependency factors and host restriction of SARS-CoV-2 using the most advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
The emergence of a new HCoV: a return to the beginning of the outbreak
The diversity of bat CoV provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoV.
In this case, the bat's CoV serves as a shell of the HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein encoder gene has the potential to drastically modify the viral phenotype.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans because the isolated SARS-CoV relative bat virus was found to encode a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with the characteristic removal of 29 nucleotides was found in isolated strains early in the human epidemic.
This deletion separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation supporting the host's transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a recombination history with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineages, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in RNA polymerase dependent RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and partly nsp14.
Similarly, the occurrence of recombination between various lineages is shown to take place in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurs in the Arabian camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoV undergoes recombination with other animal CoVs in its nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes in the viral genome, most likely resulting from the virus' release from the selection pressure experienced, such as by the host's immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 on the HCoV-229E prototype strain as a result of the removal of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpacas show single nucleotide inserts that result in skeletal shifts.
Lastly, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by selection pressure in its reservoir host.
Mild or symptomless symptoms are detected when bats are infected with CoV, which indicates mutual adaptation between CoV and bats.
It seems that bats adapt well to CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a defect in the activation of proinflammatory responses in bats will decrease the pathology that CoV triggers efficiently.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to increased regulation of NKG2/CD94 inhibitory natural killer cell receptors and low levels of histocompatibility major class I complex molecular expression.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from bat metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and affect the correction by exoribonuclease thus putting selection pressure for the creation of highly pathogenic strains of the virus as it enters the new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also develop through recombination, which results in the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the past two decades.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir host, such as bats and camels.
CoV replicates strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
Here lies the secret of the presence of a symptomless carrier and the cause of severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the activation of excessive immune responses as well as cytokine storms, with lung damage getting heavier if the immune response gets stronger.
On the other hand, in symptomless carriers, the immune response is already detached from CoV replication.
The same strategy for deciding the linkage of the immune response may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong on bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is defective.
For this reason, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a general pathway of occurrence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoVs that share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also bat CoVs that share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although ferrets and other animals on the market were found to carry the virus identical to SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
A highly homologous beta-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which suggests that trengiling may play a role as one of the intermediate hosts or beta-CoV trengiling may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although it remains questionable, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by humans either intentionally or unintentionally.
CoV is again the center of attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCoV in human transmission.
Very much evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and ferrets in the wet market, it may be the closure of the wet market and the killing of all ferrets in it that end the SARS epidemic effectively.
For the same reason, trengiling should have been removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several lineages of beta-CoV trengiling that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals still have to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in the Arabian camel.
This camel serves as an important means of transportation as well as a major source for meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local community.
Arabian camels are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we are unlikely to kill all camels to control MERS, as is done in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we succeed in eliminating this virus, a new genotype can appear and cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
In particular, the potentially zoonotic bat coV is very diverse.
There are many possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and undergo recombination, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more easily transmitted and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and coping plans should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet since long ago.
These viruses are in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spread.
Although bats have many traits that support the spread of viruses, human chances of contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from wild animals.
Sustainable surveys of mammals need to be conducted to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonotic virus is that humans must keep a distance from the ecological niches of zoonotic virus natural reservoirs.
Some parts of the zoonotic origin puzzle SARS-CoV-2 have not been found.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus to trengiling, the condition when bats and trengiling share ecological niches is important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans come into contact with bats must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that acts as an actual intermediate host, the way it interacts with other species, which includes humans, bats, and pangolins should be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets that may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental and surveillance infections should be carried out.
Whether bats, pangolins, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus can be identified in its natural host in the future.
An ongoing investigation in this field will outline the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria of "expected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19 needs to be made
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference to fight the worldwide pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is growing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we answer one of the comments in our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guide for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, currently formally called the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide was published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is growing based on ongoing research findings as well as clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example the Diagnosis and Treatment Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, this commission has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts having been changed quite a lot.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guidance as well as being a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updates based on the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Handling Guidelines (seventh version of the trial) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case it is necessary to combine one image of epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to fulfill three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or living in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas; or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2)
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicates normal lymphocyte count, decreased, or decreased in the early stages of onset.
Diagnosing confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with any of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the whole sequence of viral genomes showing high homogeneity for known new coronaviruses; (3) positive for IgM-specific antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or changes in IgG-specific antibodies to IgV-2 levels.
We can see that real-time PCR tests of nucleic acids in respiratory tract or blood samples were added in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions.
Pathogenic detection in blood samples was added in the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020); later, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
This modification was based on ongoing research by researchers to look for optimal nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the airways including blood retrieval, which increased the availability of various specimens, and supported the inclusion of certain positive antibody results into confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that reminds us to be aware of patients with atypical and symptomless symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s flow chart should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in future clinical practices and studies.
In closing, we hope more direct evidence will appear and ask readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend following and complying with the latest guidelines in their respective countries.
Our team will also update our guide periodically as a help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death toll in one day from the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of recorded cases of infection including 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases living at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news briefing, the director of the IEDCR, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41-50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Road and Bridge Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be halted longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
These public transport stops have started since March 26 and are planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still permitted.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, when two people returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 19, the three men had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections surpassed one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia suffered its first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country was one of the few countries to remain free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there are more than 244,000 cases of the coronavirus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Agency reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infection.
Worldwide, countries are announcing stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the region's quarantine until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russian citizens will remain paid without the need to go to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend national emergency status by 15 days; the vote passed by 215 votes in favor, ten votes abstained, and one vote rejected.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, such curfews only took effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement curfews between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia lower toilet tissue purchase limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoons, the Australian chain of stores Woolworth and Coles each lowered the toilet tissue purchase limit to two and one pack per transaction at all stores at the national level.
ALDI also implemented a one pack limit, on Monday.
This restriction was announced as a message on the cashier and on his network's Facebook page.
Buyers reportedly piled up supplies as a result of COVID-19 fears in case the public had to conduct self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes followed the restrictions of four packs per transaction that Woolworths and Coles had previously implemented on March 4 and 5.
In a March 8 media statement, Coles reported that with the imposition of the four-pack restrictions, "many stores are still running out within an hour of delivery", and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unprecedented".
Sales "increased sharply" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packs last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered larger packaging from suppliers and increased shipping frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers' Association, said that retailers were trying to increase inventories, but local government agency restrictions for truck delivery time made it difficult.
It anticipates rising production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that having withdrawn supplies early, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said stores filled in the supplies every night.
He emphasized that toilet paper is a large-volume item so that the amount of supplies is low and, if sold out, makes a lot of free space on the shelves so that the scarcity of goods is increasingly felt.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there’s a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and sanitary napkins can be [bought] and there’s a large amount, panic may be minimized, Russel Zimmerman told the ABC News Agency.
Recycled toilet tissue manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they were running out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made the Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, stressed they were working 24/7 to keep supplies, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder of an auction in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers took a break for a long Labor Day weekend break.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toilet tissue.
Shops are actually reluctant to impose restrictions, according to ABC Australia’s March 3 report, they say they do not plan to implement purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitary napkins, dry foods, handwashing soaps, and flour.
Similarly outside Australia, on Sunday afternoons the British online supermarket Ocado was observed limiting the purchase of Andres toilet tissue to two packs containing 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak—a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to how widespread the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to encourage governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates and mobilizes its people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.
We are very wary both because of the alarming rate of spread and severity as well as because of the alarming degree of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, “other than influenza, no respiratory tract virus has ever been traced from its emergence to a sustained global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status of the pandemic follows the WHO’s decision in January that declared the outbreak a public health emergency that is troubling the world.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of this outbreak, "in essence, this outbreak will get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a World Health Emergency on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been healed.
Case fatality figures are estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide range from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, shutting your mouth when coughing, keeping a distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard control, and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruptions, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sporting activities, and the widespread scarcity of supplies of goods exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, people with East and Southeast Asian ancestry and appearance, and people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and heavy industrial closures, air pollution and carbon emissions are decreasing.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the provincial capital of Hubei province), reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is thought to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak was called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus and related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to be ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no apparent association with the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the cluster of initial cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case that can be traced to 17 November 2019, on a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was likely the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, with new cases reported declining in China, but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has surpassed the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, particularly among people with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with people aged 19 and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the UK population needs to be infected before group immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections went undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was estimated to be greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the basic reproductive rate (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure was likely 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For the unhealed, the time from the development of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occur in people over the age of 60 and 75% have pre-existing health disorders, which include cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official death count due to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to the deceased who gave positive test results for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual fatality rate due to COVID-19 may be much higher, given the official figure is likely not to include the person who died without being tested, for example, at home, in the care home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded official COVID death calculations by a factor of 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual figure", a statement corroborated by nonscientific reports on over-calculations in the U.S. The too-low calculation often appears in the pandemic, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded respectively in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territorial territories have reported deaths, on every continent, except Antarctica. In general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the first outbreak, and the character of the population such as age, gender, and overall health. The mortality to case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the ratio of deaths to cases globally was 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) as of April 10, 2020.
This number varies by region.
In China, the estimated mortality to case ratio decreased from 17.3% (for people with the onset of symptoms 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with the onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other measurements include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from certain diseases, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from certain diseases.
These statistics are time-bound and follow a particular population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a particular population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the fatality rate of infection for the pandemic as a whole between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this range of estimates is in line with the results of the first randomised testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO insists that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end of the duration of this outbreak are unclear and may vary according to location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Without even being controlled, the infectious outbreak is usually horizontal and then begins to decline as the disease runs out of available hosts.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at the moment about when it happened".
Senior Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "this outbreak may end in June" if the entire country could be mobilised to follow WHO's advice regarding the measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for up to a year or two."
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (probably 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it is less likely that this coronavirus, because it is so easily transmitted, can disappear entirely" and the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Repetition virulence will depend on group immunity and mutation level.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and an infected person can be without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of respiratory sputum (phlegma), loss of olfactory power, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, headache, shivering, vomiting, hemoptosis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including breathing difficulties, depressed chest or persistent chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and bluishness on the face and lips; medical attention is immediately advised if these symptoms appear. Further development of the disease can be severe pneumonia, acute breath-threatening syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming the infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those in close contact with a confirmed infected person should be closely monitored and checked to ensure they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate asymptomatic ratios range from some to 44%.
The incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, the estimated number of COVID-19 sufferers who lost their initial olfactory power is 30%, then decreased to 15%.
Details about how the disease spreads are still being studied.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to occur primarily during close contact and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research found that an uncovered cough can cause a 4.5-metre (15-foot) push droplet to 8.2 metres (27-foot).
Some researchers estimate the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that last longer in the air and are produced when speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be produced when exhaling, including when speaking, although the virus is not generally transmitted through the air.
Droplets can fall in the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Several medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make the respiratory secretions turn into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Spread can also occur when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through the feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and at a later stage of the disease.
People test positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting transmission may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Few reports of asymptomatic cases have been laboratory-confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. The virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities suggest washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that an infected person may have already touched.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All new SARS-CoV-2 virus traits are related to coronaviruses in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus can be destroyed if exposed to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to early SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus was genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B lineage) along with two bat-derived strains.
The virus has 96% in common at the whole genome level with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only a difference of one amino acid in certain parts of the genome sequence between the pangolin virus and the human virus.
To date, genome-wide comparisons have found at most 92% genetic material similarity between pangolins coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by the virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is ultimately carried out through a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the infected secrete or through CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first distributed on January 17.
Testing uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on a breathing or blood sample.
Results are generally available in a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is done on nasopharyngeal swabs, but throat swabs can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the US, serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristics of radiographic imaging and computed tomography (CT) features in symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral glass ground opacity and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Because it overlaps with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging without confirmation of PCR has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT with PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging was faster and more sensitive so it was recommended to be considered as a filtration tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining comprehensive personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and wearing tissue when coughing or sneezing and directly throwing tissue into the trash.
People who may already be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical restrictive measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Governments in various regions have restricted or appealed to halt all nonessential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading the scale of society in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community, and some members of the public do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers handling people who may be infected are advised to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has sparked privacy concerns, with the release of statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user proximity to other phones.
Furthermore, users will receive messages if they are close to someone tested positive for COVID-19.Distribute misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and rinsing with mouthwashes is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after leaving the toilet or when the hands look dirty; before eating; and after exhaling the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because, outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that damages its protective layer.
Furthermore, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60% based on the volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (within one minute of disinfectant exposure to stainless steel surfaces), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in public facilities, such as offices or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, general areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sufferers, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with bent elbows or use tissue when coughing or sneezing, and immediately remove tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and mileage of expiratory droplets that are spread when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on the time and manner of wearing the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “wearing a mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch the face with their hands that are not clean enough, which is the main source of transmission.”
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people caring for COVID-19 sufferers, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks to members of the public.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of nonmedical face masks made of cloth. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to healthy communities, especially when adjacent (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or living in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia ban its people from going out into public places without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone entering the department store to wear a face mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear face masks while in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, requires commuters and intercity buses to wear face masks by April 1.
Panama requires the use of face masks every time it goes outdoors, and recommends the manufacture of homemade face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restriction (also called physical restriction) is an infection control measure intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social restrictive methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping malls.
People can apply social restriction methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Today, many governments require or appeal to social restrictions in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced, ranging from 250 (if there is no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50, and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. The elderly and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems that have a risk of serious illness and higher complications are advised by the CDC to keep as close as possible at home as possible in areas experiencing outbreaks at the community level. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to switch the use of the term "social restriction" into "physical restrictions".
The use of the term “social restriction” gives the impression that people should isolate themselves entirely socially and not encourage people to stay in touch with others through alternative ways. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during pandemic times.
These recommendations include advice for having sex only with people who live with you and do not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct self-isolation. Many governments require or recommend self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most stringent self-quarantine instructions are issued for people who belong to the high-risk group.
People who may be exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to a country or region with a wide spread of COVID-19 are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies in outbreak control are containment or suppression, as well as mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people as well as take other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to stem the spread of the disease, subsequent efforts move to the mitigation stage: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the health care system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation actions can be done at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction rate to less than 1. Part of the management of infectious disease outbreaks is seeking to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as evacuating the epidemic curve.
This lowers the risk of being overwhelmed in healthcare and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to deal with outbreaks include individual precautions, such as hand hygiene, wearing a face mask, and self-quarantine; measures at the community level aimed at physical restrictions, such as closing schools and cancelling mass meeting events; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in these kinds of interventions; as well as measures at the environmental level, such as surface cleaning. Other drastic measures aimed at curbing outbreaks are carried out in China when the severity of the outbreaks is increasing.
Other countries are also implementing various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass censorship and local quarantines, as well as issuing warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who conduct self-quarantine and impose large fines for people who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of face masks and punishes hoarders of medical supplies. Simulations for the UK and the United States show that mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and suppression (reversing the growth of epidemics) have great challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce peak demand for health care by up to 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.
Suppression can be selected, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this is the first to be achieved), because otherwise, transmission will surge back rapidly as the measures of suppression are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic have a social and economic impact.
No specific antiviral drugs have yet been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are being made, which include testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medications, drinking enough water, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
Steroid use can worsen the patient's condition.
Some compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in treating COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said that increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic step in responding to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the European regional WHO office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to divert resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible cancelling elective procedures, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, as well as improving intensive care capabilities by training personnel as well as increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A cluster of pneumonia with unknown causes was observed on December 26 and was handled by physician Zhang Jixian at Hubei Province Hospital, who told CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for the warnings she issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31 and notified the WHO.
Quite a number of unknown cases of pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan which then triggered an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during the Lunar New Year and because Wuhan is a major transportation hub and railway transit site.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area restrict free movement and create border controls.
National responses include containment measures, such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter orders, or territory quarantines) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are in a kind of regional quarantine in the United States, over 50 million people are quarantined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are quarantined in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are quarantined in India.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world are in a sort of quarantine condition, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, which is about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report shows the earliest case on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 26; this observation informed his hospital to the Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of the patient sample on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
The announcement to the public was released by the Wuhan City Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was notified on the same day.
When this notice was implemented, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign which was later described by Chinese Communist Party secretary-general Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In the so-called "biggest quarantine in human history", cordon sanitaire was announced on January 23 to stop Wuhan's inbound and outbound travel, and expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited within the city.
The Chinese New Year celebration (January 25) was cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was also built afterwards, Leishenshan Hospital, to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also turned 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into a temporary hospital. On January 26, the government drafted further measures to stem the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for tourists and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
All universities and schools in the country are also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau implement several measures, particularly in terms of schools and universities.
Measures to work remotely are applied in some areas of China.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Control of public movements is applied in many cities, and it is estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) face some sort of restrictions outside the home. After the outbreak entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent "importing" the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international tourists entering the city. On March 23, the only case of mainland China was transmitted domestically five days earlier, in this case through a tourist returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases had essentially been blocked and the outbreak had been controlled in China.
Travel restrictions on the same day were loosened in Hubei, aside from Wuhan, two months after the region's quarantine was imposed. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa holders or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March onwards, without any specific details about the time this policy will expire.
People who wish to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
On March 30, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and provide monetary stimulus packages for the company. The State Council announced a day of mourning by starting a three-minute national silent creation on April 4 at 10:00, in conjunction with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay homage online with regard to physical restrictions to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
On January 20, 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China.
On February 20, the state health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely due to a meeting of new religious movements in Daegu, known as the Jesus Shincheonji Church.
Shincheonji adherents who visited Daegu from Wuhan are thought to have been the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, among the 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13% have reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which rose to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after testing confirmed that three soldiers had tested positive for the virus.
The flight schedule was also affected and changed. South Korea introduced a program that is considered the largest and best organized program in the world to filter out the virus in the population, isolate every infected person, as well as track and quarantine people who come into contact with them.
Filtering methods include the obligation to report symptoms independently by people who have just come from abroad through a mobile app, testing a lantature virus or drive-thru with results available the following day, and increasing testing capabilities to more than 20,000 people daily.
South Korea's program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantined the entire city. At first, South Korean society's views were divided on President Moon Jae-in's response to this crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition calling for impeachment against President Moon for their claims that the government was wrong in dealing with the outbreak, or vice versa, praising the president's reaction.
On March 23, South Korea reported having the lowest total one-day cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that starting April 1 all new arrivals from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 countries.
Iran reported the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 19 in Qom and, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.

Iran allocates five trillion reals to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine the affected areas, only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to restrict intercity travel were announced in March, although heavy intercity traffic leading up to the Persian New Year continued.
Shiite places of worship in Qom remained open for pilgrims until March 16, 2020.After China, Iran became a center for the spread of the virus during February.
Amid claims that the rate of the outbreak in Iran was cover-up, more than ten countries trailed behind their cases to Iran on February 28, indicating that the rate of the outbreak may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government on that date.
Iran’s parliament closed, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally the human rights defenders detained for peaceful protest and, for a while, release all eligible prisoners.
It states that there is a greater risk for the spread in closed institutions such as detention centers, which also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, which is the largest number in the country since the start of the outbreak.
As of March 17, there were at least 12 Iranian politicians or government officials before or in office who died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran faces 50 new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there are likely to be five times more cases in Iran than reported.
It also said that U.S. sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial ability to respond to the virus outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be eased for countries affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China as well as declare a state of emergency.
Later, an unrelated cluster of COVID-19 cases was detected, beginning with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February, on 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced new laws to stem the outbreak, which included quarantines of over 50,000 people from 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the area of the outbreak, people are not allowed to go in.
Suspension of work activities and sporting events has been ordered in the area."On March 4, the Italian government ordered the total closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached 100 deaths.

A CNN report said that contributing to the high fatality rate was a combination of a large Italian elderly population and an inability to test all people infected with the virus.
Initially, the UK’s response to the virus was one of the most slack among the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government did not impose any social restrictions or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for being perceived as less responsive and less intense in response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an appeal calling for a halt to all nonessential travel and social contacts and suggested that people work from home, if possible, as well as avoid places such as pubs, restaurants, and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational places, such as pubs and gyms, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to the <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month limit to prevent unemployment in the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social restrictions measures, namely banning meetings of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activities only to activities deemed essential.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police through the awarding of fines and dissolution of the collection.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for businesses deemed "essential", which included supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and workshops.

However, the United States was slow in initiating testing so as to obscure the actual outbreak rate at the time.
Testing was disrupted by disability testing tools produced by the federal government in February, the federal government's lack of approval for nongovernmental testing tools (by academics, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people qualified testing until early March (doctor orders were required afterwards).

On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO praised the Chinese government's efforts in managing and stemming the epidemic.
WHO noted the differences between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak when Chinese authorities were accused of cover-up thus hindering prevention and containment efforts and the current crisis with the central government "provides regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday".
On January 23, in reaction to the central government's decision to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that although the move was "clearly not a WHO recommendation," but that it was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in which the outbreak was most concentrated" and he called it "unprecedented in the history of the pandemic".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared a “risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries that do not yet have a qualified health system.”
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to impose measures that interfere with travel and international trade unnecessarily" as well as "WHO does not recommend trade and movement restrictions."
On Feb. 5, the WHO called on the global community to contribute $675 million to be used to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, while citing the urgency to support countries that "do not have a system to detect people infected with the virus if the outbreak spreads."
Furthermore, Tedros made a statement that "the limits of our power are on the weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more expensive later on."In a press conference on February 11, WHO designated COVID-19 as the name of the disease for this virus.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to give "a response in the form of an all-powerful deployment of the UN system".
Later, the UN activated the Crisis Management Team to enable coordination of the entire UN response, which the WHO said would allow them to "focus on the health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to bear the impact of the outbreak in the broader social, economic, and developmental areas."
On 14 February, a Joint Mission Team with China led by WHO was activated; the team aimed to provide international experts and WHO in China in order to assist domestic management as well as evaluate "the severity and spread of the disease" by holding workshops and meetings with relevant national-level agencies and to conduct field visits to assess the "impact of countermeasures at the provincial and district levels, which include the urban and rural order."
In response to the growing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the assessment of coronavirus threats at the global level would be raised from "high" to "very high", this is the highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergency program, warned that, "It's time for every government on the planet to face the reality: Wake up.
The virus will probably come to your place and you should be ready," and urges that the right countermeasures can help the world avoid the "worst".
Furthermore, Ryan stated that current data does not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, as well as saying that such a declaration means "basically we accept that every human on the planet will be exposed to the virus."
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
WHO's director-general said that the WHO was "deeply concerned about the alarming level of spread and severity, as well as the alarming degree of inaction."The WHO received scathing criticism for being judged inadequate in dealing with the pandemic, which includes delays in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
One of the harsh reactions included a petition signed by 733,000 people as of April 6, addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom in order to file for his resignation.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respecting the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone is entitled to a life-saving intervention and the government assumes responsibility for this.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be used as a justification for discriminating against certain groups.
Experts underscore that every individual has a right to health, including disabled people, minority groups, the elderly, internal refugees, the homeless, people living in very poor conditions, people in prisons, refugees, and other groups that need government support.
International government organizations seek to address the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a program to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, along with point of view and advice.
From policies to strengthening the health system and world economy to addressing the impact of regional quarantines and travel restrictions, the digital center includes State Policy Trackers, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response in the face of coronavirus challenges.
The Chinese government received criticism from the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for handling the pandemic that began in Hubei province, China.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed regarding the handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, which is a sign of dissatisfaction with the political agency's response in dealing with the outbreak in the region.
Some commentators believe the move is intended to protect Chinese Communist Party secretary-general Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected previous recognitions about the coronavirus outbreak beginning in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originated in the US or Italy.
The U.S. government Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as "China virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "China's cover-up actions are empowering the virus that is now turning into a global pandemic." This word was eventually criticized by some critics as racism and "switched attention away from its government's failure to deal with the coronavirus."
The Daily Beast got a U.S. government message outlining a communications strategy and clearly originated in the National Security Council, with the strategy cited as "All about China.
We were told to try and deliver this message in any way possible, including press conferences and appearing on television."Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claim that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda push to influence the world.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there are "geo-political components, which include battles to gain influence through fact reversal and 'politics of generosity'."
Borrell also said that, "China aggressively encourages the message that, unlike the U.S., they are responsible and reliable partners."
China also called for the U.S. to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, as well as reportedly sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities are also accused of diverting aid intended for other countries to their own countries.
There were also mask-related disputes reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey took hundreds of ventilators aimed at Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responds bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin dispatched Russian soldiers to send military medics, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" who said that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of carrying out a “geopolitical and diplomatic” charm attack.
Lombardy's president, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media's reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane containing medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering assistance to colleagues in the U.S., [Putin] assumes that if U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials get a chance, they will also be able to retaliate if needed."
The planned “Defender 2020” NATO military exercises in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war drills since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public health crisis, this exercise not only endangers the lives of U.S. troops and many European countries participating, but also the residents of the country where they operate.”
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders for help and said that his country had difficulty fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. This outbreak has prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts suspect it could negatively impact Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to this pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambitious and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that any person coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at a government-appointed location.
Initially, the views of South Koreans were divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to this crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions, both calling for Moon's impeachment, based on their claims about the government's wrongdoing in dealing with the outbreak, as well as praising his response. The pandemic has allowed many countries to respond by issuing emergency laws.
Some commentators expressed concern that it could allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, as well as punish people deemed to be spreading false information about the virus and the handling of the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus outbreak is blamed on cases of supply shortages, stemming from increased use of equipment globally to fight outbreaks, panic buying, and disruption of factory operations and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruptions.
Some areas also experience purchases due to panic resulting in a shortage of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, which triggers a shortage of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of delays in electronic goods shipments.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty-fold the normal price and triggered a delay in the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
It also causes a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and the WHO warns that this will harm health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in a shortage of formula milk in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were spared from food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against the illegal hoarding and trade of important products are successful so that the acute food shortages that are anticipated to occur in Europe and North America can be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not experienced any significant decline, but prices can increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves are only found temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials release pork reserves to ensure the people’s nutritional sufficiency.
Similar laws also exist in Italy, which require food producers to keep reserves for emergencies like this.
The global economic downturn has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was severely hit in the first two months of 2020 as a result of measures taken by the government to contain the spread of the virus, and retail sales plummeted by 20.5%.
Because mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the virus outbreak is thought to cause a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the market will remain volatile until there is a clearer picture of the potential end result.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of the economic downturn caused by the epidemic on global growth could surpass the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate from experts at Washington University in St. Louis said the outbreak had an impact of more than $300 billion on the world supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to be "scary" after petroleum prices suffered a sharp decline due to reduced demand from China.
On February 24, the global stock market fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indices, which include the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded the sharpest drop since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–2008.
The three stock indices closed the week with a decline of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the Chinese government's credit rating, but maintained a Negative Outlook.
Shares plummeted again due to concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many people think an economic recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures of the central bank and the state on time.
The central bank reacted faster than it did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst-affected sectors due to travel bans, closures of public places including tourist attractions, and government actions that restrict travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to the lack of demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry is at a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Lunar New Year holiday.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by the central and local governments, including the annual Lunar New Year festival, and private companies also independently closed stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Chinese New Year events and tourist attractions are closed to prevent mass gatherings, including Beijing’s Forbidden City and traditional temple exhibits.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and territories, authorities extended the New Year holiday to February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions make up 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the fight against infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March, and cancelled New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally by reduced working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers experienced a 50–60% decline.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world are implementing additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check buyer temperatures, and cancellation of events. According to the estimates of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to add between 14 and 22 million people compared to the situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of China's 300 million rural migrant workers are either displaced at home in the inland province or trapped in Hubei province. As of March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates, the coronavirus outbreak could lead to the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. Regional quarantines in India caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages) to be unemployed. A survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of households in Canada experienced some sort of job loss. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost jobs in Spain since the introduction of regional quarantine in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany submitted a government-subsidized short-term employment scheme for their employees, called Kurzarbeit.
Germany's short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Worldwide, the performing arts and cultural heritage sector has been impacted greatly by the pandemic, affecting the operation of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and self-employed.
The arts and cultural sector organizations strive to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to society, safeguard the safety of employees and society, and support artists wherever possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at different levels, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with its exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were deployed to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another adverse impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, as well as fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered from disruption. The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which falls in the last week of Lent Christian conversion season, was cancelled.
Many dioceses encourage the Christian elderly to stay home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services via radio, online live broadcast or television, while others offer drive-in or lantature worship.
With the closure of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese and the vacating of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and restricted public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
Iran’s health ministry announced Friday’s cancellation of prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and places of worship were then closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events are cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season, and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but will not be more than summer 2021."Around the world, casinos and other gaming venues are closed and live broadcasts of poker tournaments are postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to switch to online gambling, many online gambling sites reported a significant increase in new registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delaying or canceling concert tours.
Many large theaters such as Broadway also delayed all performances.
Artists explore various ways to continue producing and sharing works over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live online broadcast concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their work.
Many coronavirus-themed Internet memes are spread online with many people turning to humor and distractions amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as against people from affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) noted racist sentiment expressed in various groups around the world that Chinese people deserve the virus or receive what they claim to be a worthy reward.
Some countries in Africa are also experiencing an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination due to their area's origin.
There is already support for Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in areas affected by the virus.
Following the development of outbreaks into new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subjected to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition to ban Chinese from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan became a trend on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increased rates of racist abuse and assault.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus", a term that critics deemed racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which borders China, and studies in major Indian cities are reportedly subjected to harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that China has destroyed nature and "that's why God takes revenge on them."
The statement was later denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "misleading".In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents flared up due to the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign trash" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers that use paid blocking have removed it for part or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make outbreak-related scientific papers available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share the results quickly on preprinted servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 viruses includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA alone.
This test is used to confirm a new or active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for population diagnosis and surveillance.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have already contracted, including people whose symptoms are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
Accurate disease mortality rates and group immunity levels in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has yet had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests countries have conducted.
This variability may also affect significantly the reported case fatality figures, which are likely to be calculated too high in some countries.
Using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on throat swabs are only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for an infected person tested in the second week, the sample material can be taken from the deep airways by using a suction catheter or the material excreted through a cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in Charit<0xC3><0xA9>, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed testing on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) detection device on 28 January 2020.
The device searches for the "E" gene that all beta coronaviruses have, and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Product Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tools. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the RT-PCR Real-Time Health Diagnos Diagnos Panel
One in three genetic tests in the old version of the test kit provided inconclusive results due to reagent errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully being processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using the two components was considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and it was not until after which state laboratories and local laboratories were allowed to conduct testing.
This test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. The U.S. commercial laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantity limits are announced; the collection and processing of specimens must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Virology and Biotechnology Research Center.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveyings in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that could be done within 3.5 hours with high volume so that one machine could perform about 4,128 testing within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorization to HOlogic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for testing which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology that is not PCR.
Since it does not require a series of temperature change cycles, this method can give a positive result in just five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipates to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the new coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is being developed in Taiwan, hoping to deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid influenza test.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "photos of the thorax have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, the equivalent of CT findings [computed tomography] may have existed before the onset of symptoms."
Typical features on CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distributions.
Subpleura dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation are formed as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the point of origin of the current pandemic showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals since about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance. Examinations can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care (PoCT) testing.
High-yield automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this examination, but the availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, it is commonly used one peripheral blood specimen, although a series of specimens can be used to follow an immune response.
For PoCT, it is generally used one peripheral blood specimen obtained through a skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction measures are not required prior to examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide notifications to agencies as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA based on emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in a blood sample.
Its testing capacity is up to several hundred samples in a few hours, so it is much faster than conventional PCR examinations of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits it purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong drafted a scheme for the suspected patient to stay at home, "emergency department will give the specimen tube to the patient," they spit into it, send it back, and get the test results moments later. NHS England announced that the NHS was pioneering a scheme of testing the suspected case at home so as to eliminate the risk of the patient infecting others if they came to the hospital or had to disinfect an ambulance if used. On testing lantatures for the case a suspected COVID personnel.
The lantature testing center has helped South Korea conduct the fastest and widest testing of any country. On March 2, the German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient order and 10,700 tests had been conducted in the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, land tests were offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples had been tested up to and including the weeks 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only testing further if the combined samples were found positive. In Wuhan, the emergency detection laboratory was a total of <0xE2><0x88><0x92>2,000.
With its construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling shows that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and the associated costs for quarantine handling could double if this testing capacity does not exist.
Wuhan laboratories were soon followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, its total daily capacity of 50,000 tests per day. The open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 examinations. This balanced design can be run in a small laboratory without the need for robotic fluid handling.
Until March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents had been a hindrance to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers are trying to explore a sample setup protocol involving warming the sample at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, the United Arab Emirates was reported to be doing more coronavirus testing per capita of the population than any other country, and was ready to scale up the testing scale to reach most of the population.
This was achieved through a combination of lantature testing and the purchase of a population-scale mass yield laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside China.
Various testing recipes targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German prescription for the production of test kits sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop on their own.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; protocols developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control were not available until 28 January thus slowing testing available in the U.S. Early in the outbreak, China and the United States were troubled by the reliability of the test kit; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough test kits to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts testing.
Instead, experts say that the wide availability of testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built within a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus led to hundreds of thousands of testing awaiting work in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of usap tools as well as chemical reagents became precarious.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems on their test tools.
In the United States, test tools developed by the CDC have "defects"; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing by private. Spain bought the test tools from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may be the result of failure in collecting samples or using test tools correctly.
The Spanish ministry said that it would withdraw equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace them with other test kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China which turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that these test kits be dumped into the Danube river. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test kits Turkey bought from China had "a high level of error" and they did not "use it". Great Britain bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that these test kits could not be used.
The testing, followed by the quarantine of tested positive people and the tracking of people in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive people, gave a positive end result.
Researchers working in the city of V – Italy, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on an entire population of 3,400 people, a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases found were quarantined.
With restrictions on travel to this community, new infections are eliminated altogether.
With aggressive contact tracking, entry travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, Singapore’s 2020 coronavirus pandemic is growing much slower than other developed countries without extreme restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened in time after the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries also handled the pandemic with aggressive contact tracking, entry travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less aggressive regional quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had much lower case fatality rates, perhaps because these countries were better able to detect people who had mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive samples of COVID-19 and the first ten negative samples to one of WHO's 16 referral laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America, and 1 is in Australia.
In the following chart, the "% positive test results" column is influenced by the country's testing policies.
Countries that only test people who are hospitalized will have a higher percentage of positive outcomes than countries that test all of their residents, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands aimed at removing dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via fecal-oral routes.
People can also contract respiratory diseases, such as influenza or colds, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five critical moments throughout the day that are very important to wash your hands with soap are: before and after defecating, after cleaning your child’s buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not present, the hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of sick people.
After changing diapers or cleaning children who have just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal feces.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before giving medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people handling food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the cause of infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the mortality rate of babies in childbirth at home.
Studies conducted in 2013 showed that an increase in the practice of hand washing can slightly increase the high growth of toddlers.
In developing countries, child mortality rates due to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing your hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate due to the disease by nearly 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce cases of diarrhea by about a third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in cases of diarrhea can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ISPA), as subconscious behavior is carried out in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the number one cause of infant mortality; the disease causes the deaths of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making handwashing with soap before meals and after using toilets into an embedded habit can save more lives instead of any vaccine or medical action, as well as reducing deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by up to a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined along with other sanitary measures as part of a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small side effect of hand washing is hand washing that is often done can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A study conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy and scaly skin conditions, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Washing your hands too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of the disease, namely: before and after using the toilet (urination, defecation), after cleaning the child's butt (replacing the diaper), before feeding the child, before and before/after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Another important time to apply proper hand washing techniques to prevent transmission of the disease is before and after treating wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after touching litter.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is still low.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practiced hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle at 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate at 23 percent. There are now several behavioral change methodologies available to increase adoption of handwashing habits with soap at critical times. Hand washing is a group for students at a time.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of appropriate scaled action to support the health and education of children.
Giving worm drugs twice a year, coupled with washing your hands daily with soap and brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, is at the core of this national program.
The program has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The cleaning of microorganisms from the skin is strengthened by the addition of soap or detergent to the water.
The main work of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to solution and increase soluble power.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fat and protein, which are components of organic dirt, are not easily soluble in water.
However, the cleansing of fats and proteins is aided by sufficient water flow.
Solid soaps, due to their reusable nature, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies examining the removal of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that removal was unlikely because bacteria were flushed with foam.
However, the CDC continues to state that “liquid soaps whose output from containers without touching hands are preferred.”
Antibacterial soaps are widely recommended to health-conscious communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the recommended use of antiseptics or disinfectants is better for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
So, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective substances, sophisticated formulations can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, benzoic acid as an active antimicrobial, and further skin conditioners (alcoholic tongues, vitamins, bulbs, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that regular soaps are as effective as consumer-level antibacterial soaps containing .
Warm water that is convenient for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
Warm soapy water is more effective compared to cold soapy water in removing natural oils that hold dirt and bacteria.
However, contrary to the beliefs of many people, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hand.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water based cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents of non-water-based alcohol scrubbers (also called alcohol-based hand scrubs, antiseptic hand scrubs, or hand sanitizers) became known.
Most of these hygiene agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated along with thickening materials such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into gels or alongside humectants such as glycerin into liquids or foam for easy use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity further. Hand sanitizer containing at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Rubbish alcohol refining kills bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol refiners containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (log reduction of 3.5, similar to a 35 decibels reduction) bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log reduction of 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands 1 minute after use. Hand sanitizer is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is almost entirely ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the most common cause for infectious gastroenteritis. An adequate amount of hand antiseptics or alcohol scrubbers should be used to wet or cover both hands thoroughly.
The front and back of the two hands as well as on the sidelines and ends of all fingers are rubbed about 30 seconds until liquid, foam, or dry gel.
The tip of the finger should also be well washed by rubbing it on two palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand scrubbing, especially when the hands look dirty.
Increasing use of sanitizing agents due to the ease of use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms; however, sanitizing agents should not be used in place of proper handwashing, unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer can cause dry skin, unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused much lower skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps and detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol hand scrubs are rare.
A lower tendency causes disruptive contact dermatitis to be the attraction of this product rather than washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-water agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still on hand.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizer is highly dependent on its ingredients and formulations, and historically, it has performed significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol scrubbers.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effects reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of the disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, if in contact with water, ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Proper hand washing techniques based on the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for disease transmission prevention include the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because the remaining basin may be contaminated, whereas the temperature of the water does not appear to have any effect.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with a lot of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and longer rubbing removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly under running water.
Rinsing in the basin can make the hand recontaminated.
Dry with dry wipes or let it dry in the air.
Wet and moist hands are more easily recontaminated. Frequently missed areas are thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can store microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing when tap water and/or soap is not available, for example, draining water from hung or bottled jerigens and pitted and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-tap", as well as other low-cost options.
A tippy tap is a simple technology that uses a water bottle suspended with a rope, a lever operated by the foot to pour a little water into the hand, and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
More and more studies have shown that paper wipes are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper wipe industry, to compare the cleanliness levels of paper wipes, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% in the knuckles and 254% in the palms.
Drying with jet air dryers led to an average 42% increase in the total amount of bacteria in the knuckles and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying the hands with paper wipes, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% in the knuckles and 77% in the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine potential cross-contamination in other toilet users and the toilet environment due to each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which exhales air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from hands and units and potentially polluting other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters away.
The use of a warm air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper wipes did not show significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in the amount of bacteria were observed:
There are many manufacturing hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying by using paper wipes.
Hand washing using hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative during travel if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was required long after the Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in hospital environments.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with the use of such devices.
Medical hand washing is done for at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or gel to soak and rub each part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed against each other with fingers interlinked.
If there is dirt under the nail, a fur brush can be used to remove it.
Because germs can survive in the water on hand, hands need to be rinsed thoroughly and dried with a clean wipe.
Once dry, paper wipes are used to turn off the water tap (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoids hand recontamination from such surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare order is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that lack of hand washing is still at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash their hands before touching patients thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can lower the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing the standards of hand washing and hand rubbing in the health care sector.
WHO hand hygiene concept guidelines can also be seen on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if a demonstration of compliance to regulations is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to the blood/fluid of the body
prior to the aseptic duty, and
after patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soap "drug" or "antimicrobial") serves to kill the hand washer.
Such killing functions may be desirable before surgery or in situations when antibiotic-resistant organisms are very prevalent. To 'bruise' the hands before surgical surgery, a tap is required that can be turned on and off without touching, a chlorhexidine or iodine washer, a sterile wipe to dry the hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub as well as other sterile instruments to clean the bottom of the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
A long sniping time (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinsing, the water in the lower arm should be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
Upon completion of washing the hands, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical robe is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after handling sick people.
For the control of stylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and that the additional benefit gained was very little when the frequency of hand cleaning was increased above 35%.
Washing with regular soap resulted in more than three times the transmission of infectious diseases to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. The comparison between rubbing hands with an alcohol-based solution and washing hands with an antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds each showed that alcohol-based hand scrubbers reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soaps.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand scrubbers to reduce influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in the health care order can involve education for staff about hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based hand scrubbers, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in various health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective fundamental way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap, or handwashing facilities in residents’ homes, schools, and workplaces makes achieving universal handwashing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washing taps near private toilets or public toilets are rare, although options are available to make cheap hand washes.
However, low levels of hand washing can also occur due to embedded habits and not due to lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and encouragement of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and produce long-term changes in population behavior.
In order for it to run effectively, supervision and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that a community-based approach was effective in improving handwashing at LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of a school handwashing promotion is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one star to finally three stars.
Building a hand wash can be part of a handwashing promotion campaign to reduce childhood disease and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that tries to achieve behavioral change goals. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encourages the use of handwashing emojis.
Several studies examined the effectiveness of overall handwashing costs in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of the year lost to illness.
One review showed that encouraging hand washing with soap was significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" in England.
At the time, many people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul smell called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, outbreaks transmitted through food and health care-related infections made the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more actively encouraging hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raise awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, a "right hand washing technique" poster was hung next to the hand washing sink in public toilets as well as in the toilets of offices and airports in Germany.
The phrase “washing the hands of” something means expressing a person’s reluctance to take responsibility for something or engage in something.
The phrase comes from the Biblical chapter of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands in the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands continuously to clean up imaginary stains; acts that show her guilt for the crimes she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after remembering or contemplating unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate more hand washing equipment.
Furthermore, people who are left to wash their hands after such contemplation have a smaller likelihood of being involved in "cleaning" compensation measures, such as volunteering.
Religion orders hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is the ritual part of hand washing in many religions, including Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> Beliefs, Hindus, tevilahs and netilat yadayim in Jews, Lavabo in Christians, and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also orders hand washing for hygiene, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing after using the toilet.
In addition, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam require hand washing before and after meals.
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health methodology for the control of hazards for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper hazard control in the workplace depends on the job location and job tasks, which are based on risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of each worker who may be susceptible to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure-risk jobs have minimal job contact with the public and other co-workers; for this work, basic infection prevention measures are recommended, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, respiratory ethics, and performing routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium exposure-risk jobs include jobs that require close or frequent contact with an unknown or suspected person suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected due to contagion in an ongoing society or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, work environments with high population density, and high volume retail order.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective against sneezes, and providing personal protective equipment when meeting people with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health workers and mortuaries exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 at high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or retrieve or handle specimens from, people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Suitable hazard control for these workers includes engineering control, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and self-protective devices appropriate to job tasks.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact at work.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to care for others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trading patterns can change, both in terms of the type of goods requested and how to acquire these items (such as shopping outside rush hour, via shipping, or landfill).
Finally, shipments of goods from highly affected geographical areas of COVID-19 can be disrupted. Preparedness and infection prevention plans can be used to guide protective measures.
The plan considers the level of risk associated with various workplace and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community order, as well as risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
Plans also outline the controls necessary to address such risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and plan for the prevention of infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The objectives of the outbreak management include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk for adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the communities where the business is located affects the countermeasures taken.
A hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard control based on its effectiveness.
If the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and lastly personal protective equipment.
Technical control includes isolating employees from job-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in work policies or procedures that requires the actions of workers or employers.
Personal protective equipment (APD) is considered less effective than technical and administrative control, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of APD must be selected based on hazards to workers, properly installed as applicable (e.g., respirators), worn consistently and properly, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and properly stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure-risk jobs have minimal job contact with the public and other co-workers.
The recommended basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics include covering coughs and sneezing, providing tissue and trash containers, preparing work remotely or a work turn with a gradual arrival/resistance time, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and supplies, and performing routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-lowering medications or other symptom-modifying medications, and that the sick leave policy is flexible so that it allows employees to stay home to care for sick family members, and for employees to be aware of this policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure-risk employment includes work that requires close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with an unknown or suspected person suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in communities around business locations, or because someone is new to international travel to locations with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
The group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in school, the work environment with high density COVID protection and high volume maintenance. The maintenance of workers on these groups and high risk groups includes installing high efficiency air filters, increasing the ventilation rate, installing physical barriers such as clear plastic sneeze guards, and installing drive-thru or lantature windows for customer service, administrative control for these groups and high risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home.
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a single cabin crew to take care of the sick person, and offering face masks for the sick person or having him cover his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear medical gloves once-used when caring for sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated body or surface fluids and may be another personal protective device if a sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag of biological hazards, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard control includes delaying travel if sick, isolating yourself, and informing the medical center on board immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in the cabin of an isolated person. Regardless of the spread in the community, for schools and day care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean up or disinfect if an infected person has ever been in a school building.
If there is transmission in society at a minimal to moderate level, social restriction strategies can be applied, which include: cancelling field trips, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or dining in cafeterias, increasing the distance between tables, gradual arrival and return times, restricting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is high transmission in local communities, in addition to social restriction strategies, extending school closures can be considered. For law enforcement officers who engage in daily routine activities, immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must make contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 person are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during arrest, the worker should clean and disinfect the belt and duty equipment before re-use using household sprays or wipes and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of used APD as well as to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers certain health workers and morgues to be at a high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include providing health care, support, laboratories, and medical transport personnel exposed to patients known or suspected of COVID-19.
This work becomes at risk of very high exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or retrieve or handle specimens from, patients known or suspected of COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some procedures and dental examinations, or the retrieval of invasive specimens.
High exposure risk mortuary work includes workers involved in preparing bodies of people known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of death; this work becomes at risk of very high exposure if workers perform autopsies. Additional techniques control for this risk group includes isolation space for patients known or suspected of COVID-19, including when aerosol producing procedures are performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
Specimens should be dealt with with biological safety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into different waiting rooms based on if they are suspected of COVID-19 cases. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet of patients who are known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and people who perform aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved or better N95 filter face mask respirators should be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes suitability tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend fully covered clothing or coveralls because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening officers at entry points.
For people taking respiratory specimens, caring for, or transporting COVID-19 patients without an aerosol-producing procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective goggles, or facial shields, capes, and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, surgical masks are replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Given that the supply of APD is insufficient worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for APD through long-distance medical services, physical barriers such as translucent windows, with only people involved in direct care may enter a room containing COVID-19 patients, using only the APD required for certain tasks, continuing to use the same respirators without removing them while treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and not encouraging the use of the mask for people without symptoms.

We found ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is what makes clear the global human connections and responsibilities we have with each other.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the building of a global community, which is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern that we have witnessed among all our co-workers through email, calls, and chats is a tremendous validation of the incredible human presence, which we are lucky enough, to work with them.
My gratitude and pride are infinite I can call you all co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how meaningful it is for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how it is a powerful symbol for this important resource to remain available online for everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure the site stays up-to-date, helps pay our colleagues, or helps keep our community safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, especially today.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team-c met overnight to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is the right response to the challenges we face and the best way to keep the organization going during this time.
We desperately want to remove the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce the work schedule, that’s okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don’t set a day off, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and whether you need to take care of a loved one, shop for basic necessities, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your working hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn’t need to be said, but we say it.
Sick leave or PTOs are not required, just let your manager know and help your team revise calendars and schedules to ensure key areas of work can be completed.
(If you are positively diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Bryan inside T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the proper attention of the management).
Fellows whose hour-based wages will be paid in full.
We have said it, and said it once again, in honor of our commitment to our contractor partners and hour-based staff.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal working hours when things are normal.
This includes if you are sick and can’t work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way of channeling stress to the world around us.
The work we do can be very rewarding, especially in times like these.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our demand is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to anticipate and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There are some jobs that need to keep going.
SRE, HR Operations, Trust & Security, as well as the Fundraising team, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We will begin the process with all departments to assess the current goals and shift our focus to supporting the essentials for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus fully on the most essential projects.
Slowing down the present will be nothing for the future.
We do not plan for "overtime work catching up" after this pandemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines at this time.
We recognize that the situation is changing and will attempt to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about APP (Yearly Planning)?
In order to adapt to the new realities and daily working hours expectations, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to budget so that employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and care of loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work on fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
This extension of the timeline greatly reduces the current workload and planning pressures throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegation and team on the next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Status, exposure, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we hired an antivirus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antiviral fluids to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all elevators that access our floors.
The building implements its own safety assurance protocol using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We are happy that the office will be ready for use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol to us and all staff members based in DC.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a full remote working order, in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we are also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our long-distance working colleagues realize that it may need adjustment and they want to advise you:
Limit the duration of the meeting to a maximum of one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into a few days.
Define the meeting clearly, create an agenda, and send the reading material ahead of time.
Make video the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Appoint a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and record a list of speakers, and someone to help make a note of the meeting (or do a collaborative note-making).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy small meals.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about the work being shared
The HR Operations team is seeking webinar-based ergonomics guidelines to support increased work distributed across the Foundation.
This past week we have asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declares the pandemic is over.
We inform them that we understand our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete the approved grant activities and that no one will be given a penalty for having to delay or modify those goals.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, the sentiment of the entire global community seems to be the sadness caused by this disorder, but at the same time is relieved by the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for communities to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We will send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take the time to connect with each other.
We are both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential COVID-19 related information in Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and ensure all information is in one place.
We also try to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, major workflows, or difficulties regarding coverage, or anything else that may require assistance, feel free to notify and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and be a liaison as needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive issues, please email Bryan Judan, Director of International HR Global Operations.
Let none of these changes be seen as a neglect of our work and obligations.
Rather, this change is a recognition that, at present, our work and obligations may need to be adapted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in these situations so that we can continue to work, provide the support our movement needs, and provide the world with the services they rely on.
The work we had planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create space for important work to come in the next few weeks and maybe the next few months.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work best when needed.

b'Enzyme modifier angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has the opposite activity to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising target of drugs to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has the terminal M2 peptidase domain-N and the renal amino acid transporter domain collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a type I single-stranded membrane protein, with the active domain enzymatically exposed to the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellular domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting solute protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes especially type II lung alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE counterbalance.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into the cell for some coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of S1 proteins on spikes or bulges of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and the translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosomes located within the cell.
This viral entry process also requires priming of the S protein by serine protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact leads people to hypothesize that a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells may be able to help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE and ARB inhibitor therapy.
A systematic review and metaanalysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients who have a higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results are less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipoplisacarida.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute work start in addition to the 24-hour effect length.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or to diseases with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation. RhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 application is a mobile software application designed to help track contacts to cope with the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which have official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy issues are questionable, especially with regard to systems that are based on tracking the user's geographic location of the application.
Alternatives that do not overly infiltrate privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support those Bluetooth-based apps directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 sufferers.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health care authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is still awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application is in the advanced development stage and will be available for deployment within a few weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether Singapore app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for COVID-19-diagnosed patients living in Moscow; these applications are designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, mentioned a number of practical problems that might occur in application-based systems, which include false positives and a possible lack of effectiveness if application-taken data is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, i.e. restricting only to "official" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates voiced their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using the coronavirus app, particularly as to whether surveillance infrastructure created to handle the coronavirus pandemic would be stopped once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.
The organization states eight conditions on government projects:
surveillance shall be "lawful, necessary, and proportionate";
the expansion of monitoring and surveillance should have a sunset clause;
the use of data should be restricted for the purposes of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and proven to be protected on evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid the worsening of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
there should be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
meaningful participation of all “relevant stakeholders” is required, which includes public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issue a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the issue of continuous surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the device's operating system once it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, rather than apps, thus eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server need to access personal location data; a number of privacy-protecting systems have been created and use the central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, non-application-based systems are used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using special applications, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources, includes mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes the location information publicly available, which is allowed with extensive changes to information privacy laws after the spread of MERS in the country.
This information is publicly available through a number of applications and websites. Countries like Germany consider using both a centralized system and a system that protects privacy.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not been released.
Contact tracking that protects privacy is an established concept, with a large amount of research literature starting from at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user’s proximity to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a decentralized and decentralized approach, and not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Close Tracking that Protects Decentralized Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, formerly called Contact Event Number, CEN), Protocol and other Privacy Sensitive Mechanisms for Contact Tracking.
In this protocol, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location or flow intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, the company that developed privacy technology and was originally also established at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and officers without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that have essentially the same approach and are a much overlapping protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which are key aspects to achieving wide acceptance.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government applications open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptographic technologies that protect privacy.
They also publish the specifications of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to launch in three stages:
launch of tools to allow the government to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address data retrieval and continuous surveillance issues by initially distributing the system through operating system updates, then deleting it in the same way after the threat has passed.
A drug reposition (also called the granting of a new goal, a new profile, or a new task on a drug or a therapeutic shift) is the use of an approved drug for the purpose of a new treatment, i.e. for a different disease or medical condition for the initial purpose of drug development.
It is a line of scientific research currently being conducted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be the target of the drug, each protein has several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of such ligand binding sites can be the basis of an effective antiviral drug development project against COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent polymerases, helicases, S proteins, and ADP ribophosphates.
Hussein A., et al. examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed for their skeletal resemblance to approved drugs and had the highest similarity to accelerate the development of potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in his preclinical studies to be recommended in clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that the associated chloroquine and hydrochloroquine are two of the four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that trials of chloroquine and hydrochloroquine in New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate based on the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC says that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylactic or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been established.
Doctors said they used the drug when "there was no other option".
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting safety and efficacy trials of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir proved "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency warned the public that the evidence available to support the drug was scant and too early.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan for supplies and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in cases of severe illness with viruses that have multiplicated.
This medicine may not be safe if used by pregnant women or people trying to conceive.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), which is a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "there are no observable benefits".
This drug is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a compound that will bind to the protease SARS-CoV-2.There has been criticism in the scientific community about directing resources to reposition drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in international Solidarity trials.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against some filo-, pneumo-, paramixo-, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe diseases and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies suggest remdesivir may have high genetic barriers to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospital, one for people with moderate illness and one for people with severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19, namely two controlled placebos (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The state of New York began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of patients with a new, presymptomatic coronavirus infection.
For a form of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, Phase II trials are underway with 200 patients to be recruited from severe cases of hospitalised in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to find out the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently researching the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not use effective contraceptive methods are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients so it encourages the Italian Medicine Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study on 300 patients who examined the use of sodium enoxaparin at prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention is focused on giving new treatment goals to antiviral drugs that were approved and developed for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to Chinese guidelines 7th edition
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some of the antibiotics identified potentially as drugs that could be given new goals for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by China.
In addition, trials were also conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, there are many efforts being made to develop the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to the WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the disease, will not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in a Phase I safety study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak is spreading around the world by 2020, resulting in large investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop vaccines that might be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that the things to watch out for in developing vaccines are speed, production capacity, deployment on the scale needed, as well as global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Targets of major platforms advancing to Phase I security studies, include:
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to Milken Institute), and another 37 announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials perform initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually performed at random, placebo-controlled, and in multiple locations, while determining more appropriate effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 currently active vaccine candidates developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of them are not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating a potential molecular clamping vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Center for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they are beginning to develop vaccines, with testing targets on humans by 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they were beginning to develop vaccines.
Janssen is working with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on vaccine design with a technology similar to the technology used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and would begin testing.
On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced they were starting a vaccine project to make the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They want to produce a vaccine candidate that can be tested on humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Supply Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were working with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of vaccines.
Further, the partnership announced Phase I preclinical testing and clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced they were working on 11 isolates, and even on a fast track, vaccine development took at least about a year and a half to two.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
Candidates for this vaccine are currently in laboratory research, with testing on humans planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier in the week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered “a large sum of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, the mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they will get preclinical testing results in April 2020 and vaccine candidates who are in the final stages can begin testing on humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced a US$4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development reaching US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six vaccine candidates on animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine that could self-amplify for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving a sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a C$275 million fund for 96 medical countermeasure research projects against COVID-19, which includes a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced a special C$192 million fund to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccination bank" containing several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing of PittCoVacc, a candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine, in mice; they stated that "The MNA that gave the S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine elicited a potent antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that began to appear 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, in Canada, the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities pooled resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a heterologous effect, also called a nonspecific effect.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the diseases they prevent.
A further randomized trial in Australia attempted to include 4,170 health workers.
It is possible that the vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Early studies to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, showed the need for containment measures to achieve 3 biological safety levels in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there are no protective drugs or vaccines for SARS that have been proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. In addition, proven vaccines for MERS also do not exist.
When MERS became prevalent, existing SARS research was believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completes phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are virus-vectored vaccines, two adenovirus-vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-MERS-S (MVA-MERS-S) vector.
Social media posts echo conspiracy theories that claim the virus behind COVID-19 has been previously known and that vaccines are available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of olfactory power, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and fail compound organs.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The virus is mainly spread between humans during close contact, often through sparks or small droplets produced through coughing, sneezing, or while speaking.
Although produced when exhaling, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not contagious to long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can last up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and after the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by reaction of the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) on nasopharynx.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of contracting the virus and people treating it.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend their use, and some require their use.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be without symptoms or experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or tightness in the chest that is persistent, confusion, difficulty waking up, and bluish face or lips; medical stretches are immediately advised if these symptoms appear.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, snot, or sore throats may be encountered, but they are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China were initially only with a clinical picture of chest tightness and palpitations.
In some people, the disease can develop into pneumonia, failure of the compound organs, and death.
This period is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of symptomatic people will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of these symptomless carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people showing no symptoms is not yet known and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain symptomless during hospitalization.
China's National Health Commission began to include symptomless cases in its daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry viral charges on a large scale.
Talking out loud releases more sparks or droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that an uncovered cough can cause droplets to be pushed as far as 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted by air, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur and air collectors placed in passageways outside people's rooms produce a positive sample for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the pulmonary heart (RJP), can make the respiratory secretions turn into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through the feces, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. The virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap products break down the protective fat layer of the virus, deactivate the virus, as well as free it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), were less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in the median two days after hospitalization began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral payload, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral payload on the second day of testing.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus features exist in the coronavirus that is related in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which damages its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cell via angiotensin 2 (ACE2)-modifying enzyme, the most abundant in lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike or bulge" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injuries were found in 12% of infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe illness.
Cardiovascular symptom levels are high due to the presence of systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
The incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) are high found in COVID-19 infection patients in the ICU and may be related to a poor prognosis. Autopsies in people who die of COVID-19 find alveolar diffuse damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for airway epithelial cells that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
In particular, T cells that secrete pathogenic GM-CSF have been shown to correlate with the recruitment of monocytes that secrete IL-6 inflammatory and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrate has also been reported in autopsies.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This testing is usually done on breathing samples obtained through nasopharyngeal swabs; however, nasal or sputum swab samples can also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but it requires two blood samples taken at a distance of two weeks so that the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate the strain of this coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR) to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if a person has been infected before) were under development, but have not been widely used.
China's experience with the testing showed its accuracy was only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 for use by the end of that month. The diagnosis guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical picture and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution is widely encountered early in infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (the thickening of the lobular septum with alveolar filling varies), and consolidation can arise as the disease progresses.
Little data is available about the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings on autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the formation of giant cells of many rings
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: the arrangement of exudate in the alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disinfecting intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, often washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings from fabrics in public places, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. The social restriction strategy aims to reduce contact of infected people with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public places.
Restriction guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
Since vaccines are anticipated to not exist until early 2021, a major part of dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "lapping the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after leaving the toilet or when their hands look dirty, before eating, as well as after exhaling their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Furthermore the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizer is not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as humectant.
People are treated with support care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends people who suspect they carry the virus to wear a simple face mask.
Oxygenation of the extracorporeum membrane (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still considered.
Self-cleaning and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive care may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for dealing with hospitalized COVID-19 sufferers.
Intensive care experts and pulmonary experts in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various institutions into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend paracetamol (asetaminofen) rather than ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health workers caring for COVID-19 sufferers, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective devices (APD) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment are: APD robes, respirators or face masks, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (not face masks) are better.
The N95 respirator was approved for the industrial order, but the FDA has authorised this mask for use based on the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
N95 respirators are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified use on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face protection or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not particularly severe until they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are indeed severe.
This type of respiratory support for people experiencing COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for inpatients, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow nasal cannula or bipositive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these two methods produces the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical ventilation, if available, because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannulas. More severe cases occur in the elderly (people over 60 years of age, and especially people over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the health system's capacity to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 sufferers eventually enter the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators capable of high pressure and PEEP control modes are required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of ventilator-related lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, some of the drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people with severe illness.
WHO-recommended volunteers participated in potential treatment effectiveness and safety trials. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in case a person's life is very or immediately threatened.
Convalescent plasma has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to prove its safety and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect ‘close contacts’ using surveillance data so it can detect potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also informs local health workers. Mahadata analytics on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people who come into contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of contracting the coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enact quarantine and protect people who may be in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed aggregate telephone location data to the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told by mobile operators that "40% of citizens are still moving around".
The German government carried out a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People can experience pressure from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic downturn are perfect storms that endanger mental health and people's well-being."
The disease can last mildly with little or no symptoms, which resemble other common upper respiratory diseases, such as colds.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs causing pneumonia.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting abnormalities, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while kidney function abnormalities were seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 picture show an increase in liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study that examined early cases, the median time from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromiksoid exudate in both lungs.
Cytopathic changes of the virus are observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was observed, with increased levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people hospitalized have congenital conditions. The availability of medical and socioeconomic resources of an area can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from conditions vary due to differences in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The lack of a mild case count can cause the death rate to be calculated too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases that took place in the past can mean that the current mortality rate is calculated too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die than nonsmokers. There are concerns about the long-term sequela of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause pastetreatment-intensive syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not yet known if previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible, if it looks at the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there have been reported cases of recovering COVID-19 followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days after.
The case is believed to be a worsening residual infection, and not a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated from animals, through a spreading infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection is almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest symptom onset date was December 1, 2019.
Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the first outbreak, and the character of the population such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO established the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death-to-case ratio globally was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measurements include case fatality figures (CFR), which reflect the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a particular disease, and infection fatality figures (IFR), which reflect the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are time-bound and follow a particular population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the plague in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village containing 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7%) had already died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread through the Carnival festival, which spreads to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and possibly not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) were confrigated to die of COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for both men and women.
Mortality was higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the risk gap between new men and women not apparent by age 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for these differences based on gender is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower smoking prevalence in women, and men who have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of people infected are men and 72% of people who died from COVID-19 are men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of health workers of the female sex is higher, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a particular geographic location (e.g. China), animal species, or a group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses the "COVID-19 virus" and the "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in accordance with 2015 guidelines urging not to use location names in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal swabs and ventilators components.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital desperately needed ventilator valves, and suppliers could not deliver in the required timescale, a local company engineered-back and printed 100 required valves overnight.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation sprung up regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread quickly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved to treat the disease.
International research into COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated a “SOLIDARITY Trial” to examine the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
Vaccines are not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research into SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under review.
First, researchers aim to make the virus vaccine intact.
The use of the virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to quickly trigger the human body’s immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits in the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on S-spike proteins that help viruses infiltrate ACE2 enzyme receptors.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (a DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique for making vaccinations).
Experimental vaccines created with these strategies should be tested to determine their safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancements have been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatment for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
New purpose-given antiviral drugs make up most of China's research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in some countries with reporting deadlines in late April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates already exists.Some existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which includes remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, there is temporary evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for a peer review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, noted that double doses are extremely dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 sufferers.The 7th edition of China's guidelines also included interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations.Research shows that early priming of the bulge protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm complications can occur in the advanced stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anticytokine properties. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China once a small study is completed.
The drug is undergoing a non-random phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, the drug is intended to fight cytokine storms, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-induced refractory cytokine release syndrome by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence to suggest that tocilizumab is a viable treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a nonvaccine passive immunization method.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a working mechanism that is expected for passive antibody therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity that depend on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced, are under development.
The production of convalescent serum, which is a fluid part of the patient's blood that has been cured and contains antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
