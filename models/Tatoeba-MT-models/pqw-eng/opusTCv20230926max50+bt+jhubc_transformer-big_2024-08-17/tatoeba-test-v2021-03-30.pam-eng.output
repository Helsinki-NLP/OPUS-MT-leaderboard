I'm going to kill my king.
A cup of coffee?
Tom N<0xC3><0xA1>pun is the king of the gym.
It's not pepagogical, but it's not pedagogical.
It's the same as Tom's in the bathroom.
I'm from Boston.
I'm going to go with Aldo's.
Tom Atl<0xC3><0xBA> was born in Boston.
It's a great way to get rid of the bumper stickers.

He looked at her in Mary's lap.
It's in my closet.
How do you feel about the King of Pop?
What do you think of the King and Queen of the Rings?
What's the point of the squabbling in a pig's mouth?
P<0xC3><0xA1>sal<0xC3><0xA1>mat ku kareng <0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>'an.
I'm going to go to the King's Hospital.
It's a good thing that you're going to have to go to the morgue.
I'm going to go to Tom's.
I've always been a fan of Tom Petty, and I'm more than happy with it.

It doesn't have to be a problem, but it's in the middle of a blizzard of a blizzard.
It's more action-packed.
What's up with Tom?
At<0xC3><0xAD>ng b<0xC3><0xA1>yung pan amp<0xC3><0xB3>ng dan<0xC3><0xBA>m here.

It's a good idea to make an effort to get it right.
It's a bit of a stretch when Tom's got it.
I'll bet you're a minion.
I'm a big fan of being the great King of Boston.
It's in the cassava.
I've been wanting to.
Are you the king of the jungle?
KEKA, are you?
Pak<0xC3><0xA1>lon mul<0xC3><0xA1>.

I've been trying to get my hands on my bike.
It's just M<0xC3><0xA9>kiramd<0xC3><0xA1>m.
Tom's body is in the nick of time.
Do you want to go to the grocery store?
I'm going to NG.
You're leaving.
The king's ambition is to say goodbye.
Ik<0xC3><0xAD>t ke i Joe any<0xC3><0xA1>ng Dumingg<0xC3><0xBA>.
It's a bit of a stretch, but it's an a-hole.
It's in the middle of an alley.
I'm going to burn my ass.
You're running errands.
King of California is King of California.
It's a bit of a pain in the ass, but I'm in the middle of it.
I'm going to have to give Tom a thumbs up.
I don't think it's just a libr<0xC3><0xBA>.
It's worth a minute.

In the heart of Mary.
Would you like to receive an e-mail from the King?
The king's sal<0xC3><0xA1>mat is palatalized.
There's no such thing as God's grace in the wilderness.

In the broccoli in the center of the pancakes, there is a small amount of meat.
I'm sure she'll remember the squealing.

It's a shame when it comes to baking.
I'm the one who beat Tom.

Tom nodded.
I went to the King's Gym.
It's a foodie.
It's just a half-marathon.
You're in the middle of a stagnant.
Let's go to Tom.
You're the king of the jungle in the sky.
It's in Tom's basement.
He's happy with it.
It's just a glimmer of hope.
Just L<0xC3><0xAD>nub.

You're telling me?
It's a good idea to take a nap.
How far do you have to go?
