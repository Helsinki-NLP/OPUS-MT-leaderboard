Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidences of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) show a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom confirming that, despite being at different levels depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly across all countries.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness for an increasing number of patients with COVID-19 who will need health care, and in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent was the novel coronavirus which is now referred to as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Up to now it has been proven that about 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild illness, e.g. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these patients recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease that requires hospitalization while the remaining 6% of cases suffer from critical illnesses that require intensive care.
The death of patients treated in hospital due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared those countries to Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with Italy during 31 January – 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 is experiencing further geographic transmission and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world at this time according to the dynamics of the country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe in accordance with the WHO's definition of cases.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 among those returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), which between 31 December 2019 and including that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting a cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases notified in every country around the world, obtained from official sources only such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data is used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK, as well as compare that data to Italy.
As an active proxy for the spread of COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the cumulative incidence of the 14 days of COVID-19 cases, therefore taking into account the natural route of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK countries, during the period of 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases notified for each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to the number of Italian cases for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and UK countries
The trend in cumulative incidents is the 14-day cut of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and then increased significantly around February 28, 2020 (Additional material).
This is largely driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, however all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar upward trend for the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (Additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in the EU/EEA and UK countries compared to cases in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
It stressed that, as of March 15 at 8:00 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported the same number of cases as Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and UK.
The observed cumulative incidence trend of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is spreading at the same speed in all countries.
Although countries are at different levels, diversity in national public health responses and definitions of cases may vary in countries as well as different protocols for selecting patients who must be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including follow-up tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected region of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients infected with COVID-19 needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA levels for cases of 6% and 1% only, respectively (data not shown).
However, such data should be collected in a systematic way to support current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The 2010-11 study showed a significant variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that the country has more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
The modelling scenario related to the saturation of healthcare capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA and UK countries for the spread of hospitalised COVID-19 cases associated with a <0x3E>90% risk exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds, is provided in the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 by the ECDC.
Since so far cases have formed clusters in certain regions of the EU/EEA and UK countries, as well as hospitals and intensive care units usually handle a clear population of area concentrations, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided in the Nomenclature for regional units for statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries indicate the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for the scenario of a gradual community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19-infected patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is happening in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the ECDC's recent rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive and thorough approach is essential to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to reduction, as the expectation of a rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their responses accordingly if not implemented in advance.
Rapid risk assessments also list general health care measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window of opportunity where countries have the possibility to continue to increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as well as reduce stress on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that the health care system of other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, wreaking havoc on humans.
Just like its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of humans in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be spread from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS but is more contagious and affects more older people than teenagers and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly growing research subject.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that this review helps in understanding and eradicating the life-threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unexpected and unforgettable memory of Chinese people who were urged to stay at home during the holiday season and weeks later due to the outbreak of a novel viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China and soon spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients being allowed to return home and more than 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1" and has the potential to be stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 2000 papers have been published on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since its first report on 7 January 2020 that determined the isolated viral sequence of some patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in that new and rapidly growing subject area.
When appropriate, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease that stems from CoV, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, erupted in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some other important questions.
CoV has traditionally been considered a harmless pathogen to humans, usually the cause of about 15% of the common cold 4.
However, in this century, we have twice discovered high-pathogenic human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks of their respective origins in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with severe morbidity and mortality rates.
Therefore, COVID-19 is currently the third recorded COVID-19 outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to China's National Health Commission.
Seven days later the CoV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, regions and countries.
On January 20, infections among healthcare staff were reported, suggesting that human-to-human infections could occur.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was imposed a curfew with all public transport services suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which is thought to be the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the disease a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation is developing rapidly, the final scope and severity of the disease are not yet certain.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provided more recent illustrations of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects patients of all ages, but most are aged 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected patients are over 50 years old, very few are under 20 years old and only 14 individuals are under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 develops in clusters mostly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from start to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted RO is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, corresponding to the time of mass movement before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases is 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients is 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of large, protected viruses that contain single-stranded sensory RNA.
The virus can be divided into four genera, e.g., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, among all alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Spike (S) surface glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptor angiotensin modifier enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide peptide 4 (DPP4) for each SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane merging takes effect.
The viral RNA genus is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genus, the genome RNA is accompanied by surface glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins form vesicles containing virions, which then join the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity in 10 sequential samples taken from the disease's original site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through a transfer electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in the thinnest part of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was found to be a recipient for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new simple protein encoded by orf3b and a protein secreted by orf8.
Orf3b for SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and have IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that the cyro-EM structure of human ACE2 is fully at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in complex with the amino transporter of the B0AT1 assis.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed confirmation, was combined as a dimer and the ACE-BOAT2 complex could combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug screening to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and mid-sized hoses
It is well known that both SARS-CoV and MERS Cov are derived from bats and transferred to humans respectively through weasels and camels.
Through the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to other CoVs, bats are considered to be the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like ones from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate hosts that help the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remain unknown, and the transmission path remains unexplained.
Ji, et al., suggest snakes as carriers of viruses from bats to humans involving homologous recombination in S protein.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that pangolins - long-nosed ant-eater mammals that have always been used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 based on the 99% genetic homology in CoV found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread across the two genomes is still a huge difference; therefore, the final decision to prepare concrete evidence is being awaited (Figure.33).
The physicochemical properties of SRAS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 45 days below 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfection, peracetic acid, chlorofom, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively deactivate the virus.
The entire human population generally has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore considered vulnerable to novel viruses.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Generally, after the virus invades the host, the virus is first identified by the host's natural immune system through pattern identification receptors (PRRs) including receptors such as C-type lectins, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Despite different pathways, the virus results in the expression of inflammatory factors, maturity of dendritic cells and interferon cystes of type I (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate phagocytosis of viral antigen macrophages.
However, the protein N SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune response.
Shortly thereafter, the immune response of the adaptation was also against the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8<0x2B> T cells continue to kill virus-infected cells.
The helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the defense cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by resulting in apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity includes complements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, isolated antibodies from cured patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system generates large amounts of free radicals in the body that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, as well as, in the worst case scenario, the failure of some organs, even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on early clusters, is more likely to affect the elderly with comorbidities and pregnant women.
Being common for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is affected, they have a higher chance of getting infected than others.
The average estimated incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as mentioned above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, as well as preventing those who are infected but have no symptoms from spreading the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to, or infected by, the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually a major and early symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied without any other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, renal pain, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's condition immediately increases to acute respiratory syndrome, septic detachment, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of family clusters and clusters resulting from the spread of asymptomatic individuals.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had a fever (98%), a dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
Yet, 80% of them require respiratory assistance, far more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher malignancy by MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) are the main symptoms and respiratory assistance has been needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, the death rate due to COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, the mortality rate from SARS until November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
The comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to the symptoms, mortality rate and RO of the disease is shown in Table 1.1.
The numbers above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to transmit than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less fatal than the two diseases.
Therefore, it is much more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Cluster start-ups often occur in the same family or from the same gathering or vehicles such as cruise ships.
Patients usually have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with an infected individual or patient in the last two weeks before the onset of illness.
However, it has been reported that patients can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and patients who have recovered who are allowed to return from the hospital can carry the virus again, which sends a warning to increase quarantine time.
The patient has a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L includes lymphocyte count <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and elevated levels of aminotransferase aspartate and viremia have been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes as well as myoglobin have increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein as well as erythrocyte sedimentation have increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels, fibrin degradation products present in the blood, have increased, and the lymphocyte count has significantly decreased.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are indicated by bilaterally concentrated shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients usually suffer from atopic pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, rapid accumulation of fluid and fibrosis adversely affects gas exchange.
Type-I and type-II pneumocyte dysfunction reduces surfactant levels and increases surface tension, while reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Thus, the discovery of poor chest radiography is usually in line with the most severe stage of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of hyalin membranes and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes as well as multinucleated syncytium cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with the pathologies of viral infections and ARDS as well as similar to the pathologies of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a transcription-reversible polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, as a result of the high false negative rate, which may provoke epidemics, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation exists with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings are important as well as imperative to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group described the prototype use of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detected fragments of SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using dipping rods in less than an hour without the need for complicated equipment.
Hopefully, the new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and convenience if confirmed in clinical samples.
As a result of the lack of experience with the novel CoV, doctors can generally provide supportive treatment to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or proposed previously for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatment with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from cured patients is also recommended for use for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 usually attacks the lungs at the initial stage and may also attack, to a lesser extent, other organs that produce ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal and renal systems.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are major threats to the patient and are the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is important for relieving symptoms and saving lives as well as including general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by the oxygenation of the extracorporeum membrane (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary grafting technique used for the treatment of cardiopulmonary or respiratory failure.
In addition, retention of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections as well as sepsis shock, and protection of vital organ function are also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storms result from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines trigger immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals that are the main causes of ARDS and the failure of multiple organs.
Immunotinisation is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunotinated treatments for cytokine storms include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF restriction; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppression 4; and HDAC inhibition.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in treating SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids at high doses can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, low to moderate doses of corticosteroids for a short period of time have been recommended to be used with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
As of this writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous use with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective against an American patient infected with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed the possibility of inhibition of other single-belt RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these observations, Gilead has given the mix to China to conduct a pair of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects can occur after combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this treatment with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from cured patients and antibody generation
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from being infected with the disease has a long history.
It is true that patients who have been cured usually have relatively high levels of antibodies to pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and it identifies unique molecules in the pathogen and neutralizes them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and had been injected into 10 patients who were in serious condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral load as well as increased saturation in the blood.
However, verification and explanation are needed to suggest such methods for large-scale use before specific therapies are yet to be developed.
In addition, due to the presence of therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with the plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma is great for treating critical patients.
It is difficult to wake up and produce antibodies that are specific quickly to fight the global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients as well as identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or filter out effective antibodies against important viral proteins.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends a lot on the combination of various components in formulas that vary according to the diagnosis of disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most effective components remain unknown or obscure given that it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe levels.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rates of cure in the treatment of COVID-19 patients have been seen in some regions of China that use TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which uses TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a rather rough comparison as many other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patient need to be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study to compare western drug treatment (WM) alone with a combination of WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time needed for body temperature recovery, loss of symptoms and treatment in hospitals was significantly shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the rate for symptomatic conditions became worse (from mild to severe) significantly lower for the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, TCM's effectiveness and safety are still awaiting more controlled trials at a larger level and in more centres.
It should also be interesting to describe the mechanism of action and explain the effective components in the treatment of TCM or the combination of those treatments if possible.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 mostly experience intense fear of a highly contagious disease and can cause the death, while those who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia and cough as well as the adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to higher anxiety and mental stress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, various psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide were also reported.
Detection of mandatory and quarantine contacts, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, can cause people to feel more worried and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and those in contact with them as well as the public community in need of them.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for disrupting the transfer chain from infected animal and human areas to exposed hosts as well as typically supplementing antiviral treatment in epidemic control caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made by developing S-protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
A debilitating vaccine has been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and their dangerous models of challenges and protection against zoonotic virus infection should be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
By contrast, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions as a result of continued zoonotic resources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using unactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, some of which have been tested in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and important task of regulating the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulties because a long period of time (an average of 18 months) is needed for the development of vaccines and dynamic variations of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just shown a full clinical pathway in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover slowly without being re-infected.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is important for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-poor areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table33):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 usually occurs in 30-65 years of age with 47.7% of such patients aged over 50 years in a study of 8,866 cases mentioned above.
Patients who need intensive care are more likely to have comorbidities and hidden complications and are much older than those who do not need them (at the median age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognosis factor for COVID-19 patients' results.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac and arrhythmia injuries.
Cardium problems are also the cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be bound to ACE2 positive colangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is natural to note that age and hidden diseases are interrelated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been suggested as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and final healing.
CRP-level links to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 have also been proposed.
In addition, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and increased creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict results.
These enzymes are secreted in many different organs, especially the heart and liver, and removed during tissue damage.
Therefore, it becomes a traditional marker for heart or liver dysfunction.
Primary clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and timely progression of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues to predict the consequences as well as complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunotindans commonly used as an adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Viewing high doses of corticosteroids has been widely used in severe SARS patients, many former patients suffer from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short periods in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients have suffered from extreme stress as they often face long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witnessing the deaths of close family members and patients' friends.
It is important to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help this patient recover from stress as well as return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to doubling in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can multiply efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the initial phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, patients infected in the early phase or incubation period can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is thought to occur during severe illness, while most transmissions do not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are underway in China including a curfew in Wuhan and the surrounding city as well as a continuing quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of severing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While this action is damaging the economy and other sectors of the country significantly, the number of new patients is declining, marking the slowdown of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the pandemic will end at the end of March and the phase of decline will run for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the effects of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both a central turbine swab and the esophagus of patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, signaling that the newly identified virus could be a recurring episode such as influenza.
However, convincing signals have occurred in China based on a declining number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may be effective.
Ebola was initially predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
Therefore, just like SARS-CoV, it may be that the SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes weaker and eventually ends up or becomes a less pathogenic virus that exists with humans.
A comparison between the COVID-19 epidemic and SARS and MERS is provided below (Rajah (Rajah55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with a substance that has been contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in feces, which raises new possibilities of transmission from feces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be due to nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health workers.
Therefore, careful precautions should be used to protect people, especially health workers, social workers, family members, friends, even people on the side of the road who are in contact with an infected patient or person.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of exposure is wearing a face mask; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series <0x23> 1860) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from individuals who are likely to be infected from spreading through ventilation or sticking to the surface of the material, which in turn can be spread to others.
However, only N95-type masks (series <0x23>1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions being able to penetrate N95-type masks; SARS-CoV-2 is almost the same size as SARS-CoV in terms of size where both are approximately 85 nm in size.
Since the virus particles can penetrate five surgical face masks worn together, health workers who have direct contact with patients will need to wear N95 masks (series <0x23>1860s) instead of surgical face masks.
In addition to face masks, health workers need to wear personal protective equipment to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect individuals through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 face mask; the virus may have entered his body through an inflammatory eye.
In addition, health workers should also wear transparent face protectors or safety glasses when dealing with patients.
For the public in the affected or potentially affected areas, it is advisable that all residents wash their hands with disinfectant soap regularly, stay at home and reduce contact with individuals who are likely to be infected.
A three-foot distance is considered an appropriate distance to keep away from the patient.
These measures are effective in reducing the risk of infection in addition to preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, the high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 warns China as the SARS outbreak struck in 2003.
However, only on 19 January 2020 the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tried to reduce the concern of his citizens by saying that the novel virus has a low infection rate and limited reproduction in humans as well as prevention and containment of the disease is not a problem.
The message was able to defuse public concerns, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Autumn Festival, and it was not possible to prevent the spread of the epidemic on a minimum scale in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can take advantage of this and make improvements in the future.
For example, appropriate agencies (1) are more careful in making public announcements as every detail presented affects people's attitudes and decisions; (2) are more sensitive and reactive to unusual information received from clinics than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) are more assertive in curbing outbreaks than are the public; and (4) are more likely to conduct exercises to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the public response system on a regular basis.
The spread of COVID-19 is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that began in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, it has spread throughout China and nearly 50 countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is almost identical to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar to SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created the sentiment that the SARS outbreak has been recurrent.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in curbing epidemics as well as treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people compared to young people and affects more men than women, the severity and mortality rate is also higher in the elderly compared to youth.
SARS has a higher mortality rate compared to COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can spread the virus without experiencing any symptoms while SARS patients spread the virus in sick conditions, resulting in difficulties in curbing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains the cause of SARS-CoV-2 spreading faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
The RNA test results for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for COVID-19 patients.
However, patients who have recovered can be found to be positive for the virus again.
This discovery indirectly increases the risk of virus transmission.
Based on the rapid progress in the study of COVID-19, some critical issues still need to be addressed, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
While 96% of genetic homologs are found in SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs such as SARS bats, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is also derived from bats.
What animals are the intermediate species that spread the virus from the host, for example bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answer to <0x23>1 and 2, we can't break transmission efficiently, and the epidemic can recur at any time.
Although molecular and biochemical model tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2, how exactly can viruses enter the cells of the airways and subsequently result in pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2 expression cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically through transmission among humans?
Will it be a pandemic around the world, wiped out like SARS or relapsed periodically like the flu?
This is important but it will take time to find the answers to the above questions and various other questions.
However, no matter the expenses to be claimed, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
The zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Mutations and adaptations have driven the shared evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its main hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) had been known to cause mild illness, such as the flu.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed their outlook and revealed how HCoV is devastating and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China at the end of 2019 has caught the attention of CoV and surprised us with its simple but less pathogenic infectiousness compared to SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic and an understanding of the zoonotic origin of HCoV can help us.
Most HCoVs come from non-pathogenic bats.
Intermediate reservoir hosts for some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Investigations into the interactions of CoV hosts in animals allow the importance of understanding the pathogenesis of CoV in humans to be acquired.
In this study, we presented an overview of existing knowledge of seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as zoonotic origin and transmission between species.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate HCoV differences from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The epidemic of COVID-19 is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for a successful host exchange as well as the implications for the evolution of the virus to the severity of the disease are also stressed.
Coronavirus (CoV) is from the family of Coronaviridae, which consists of a single, positively charged, enveloped RNA virus group.
This genome is between 26 and 32 kilobases long and is the largest genome among RNA viruses and is named "CoV" because of its morphological shape that looks like a crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that shares the same arrangement.
It is estimated that two-thirds of this genome has two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) overlapping each other, which are later translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replicase.
Polyproteins are then processed to produce 16 unstructured proteins, known as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORFs for structured proteins, including nails (S), covers (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Several specialised protein accessory proteins are also encoded according to different customers of CoV.
Based on protein sequence differences, CoV is classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), in which the beta-CoV genera consist of most HCoVs and are divided into four sequences (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and mice act as the source of genes for most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the primary reservoirs for gamma-CoV and delta-coV.
For thousands of years, CoV has surpassed species resistance and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 which are alpha-CoV.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually result in mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, the newly identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, resulting in severe lower respiratory tract infections in patients with a high probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients with the flu in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been collected through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both resulting in symptoms of self-control.
This concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is harmless until an outbreak of SARS emerges.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 and is one of the most devastating in history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a roughly 10% gross death rate.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a continuing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The novel HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the leading agent of the ongoing epidemic of the 2010 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-1), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 individuals as of March 3, 2020.
Warnings have been given and the world needs to be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from bats, rats and domestic animals.
Various evidence supports the evolutionary origins of all HCovs from bats, where viruses are easily adaptable and not pathogenic but exhibit great genetic diversity.
The COVID-2019 epidemic has brought great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China as well as the rest of the world.
The detection of zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and limiting factors for species jumps.
It may also guide and facilitate the search for reservoir, intermediate and feeder animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in the prevention of future overflows.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, transmission between species and pathogenesis of HCoV.
In particular, we outlined and discussed a common theme where HCoV virion is not pathogenic in the host's natural reservoir but becomes pathogenic after interspecies transmission to the new host.
We also reviewed the direction of the evolutionary flow of HCoV where an increase in transmission often appears with a reduction in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal cov has been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal discharge of patients with the flu, different CoVs were isolated in a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in the chronological rules (Table 1) can provide information and instruction.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with germ infections in the upper respiratory tract in 1966, and subsequently adapted to grow in the lung cell line WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E are seen with flu symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, lethargy and sore throats, with fever and cough seen in 10-20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequently serialized citations in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection is seen to be similar to an infection by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from an infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and tend to spread more during winter in temperate regions.
Usually, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by the disease for about 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E experienced a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients show severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is a pandemic caused by the first well-documented HCoV in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
In addition to super diffusers, it is estimated that each case can cause about two secondary cases, with incubation periods between 4 to 7 days and viral-free peaks appearing on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show myalgia, headaches, fever, fainting and cold, followed by dyspnea, coughing and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphophenia, a test of scattered liver function and an increased creatine kinase is the normal laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophages enhancement have also been observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients then need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to infection of the lower respiratory tract, various organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can cause death especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative to an index patient traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a lot of work has been done on HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially the virus was found to be widespread among children, senior citizens and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause of about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and the peak time of occurrence of the disease is during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as krup.
That same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to infectious pneumonia and bronchiolitis in the community, HCoV-HKU1 has also been reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbations.
Just like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
All four infected HCoVs in this community have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents do occur for unknown reasons as there are rare cases of the more severe subtype HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to spread efficiently and to remain continuously in the human body, the virus also becomes less harmful or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary transmission to close contacts have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations for MERS resemble SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also suffer from acute kidney failure, which is so far unique to MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high case death of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most severe viruses to hit humans.
During mid- to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients who are retrospectively known to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections due to SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency at the International Level and has also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been reported worldwide, with a gross case death of 3.4%.
Significantly, case deaths in Hubei, China were 4.2%, while case deaths outside the area were 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea also occurs in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly escalate into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, the virus grouped into distinct branches on phylogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to rapid transmission worldwide.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals very interesting similarities as well as differences.
First, the timing of incubation and the duration of the occurrence of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs found from the community (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows more commonly seen features during HCoV infection found from the community, including the presence of non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows an interesting pattern characteristic for both HCoV found from the community and SARS-CoV.
In a way, SARS-CoV-2 infection is at least as high as HCoV found from the community.
On the other hand, it is difficult to confirm whether SARS-CoV-2 infection decreases after passing through humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
Whether a stool-to-mouth transplant for SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under certain conditions awaits enlightenment through future studies.
It's also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may have been triggered by the season as in the case of HCoV being infected in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including infectious, pathogenic and post-human transmission will affect the fate of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
All four HCoVs infected in the community cause mild symptoms to have adapted well to humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the previous HCoV pandemic.
HCoV, which causes severe disease in humans and humans with severe HCoV disease, has been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCoV needs to double in humans to sufficient levels to allow the collection of adaptive mutations that counteract the host restriction factor.
Therefore, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more humans are infected, the greater the chance for the virus to fully adapt to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission in humans will be difficult to prevent with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four infected CoVs in the community circulated in the human population, triggering the common cold in the subject of immunocompromised.
The virus does not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and the transmission of the virus in humans cannot be sustained.
The virus needs to remain and reproduce in its zoonotic reservoirs as well as look for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and breeding hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same characteristics as both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and all four HCoVs infected in the community.
It is very contagious as HCoV is infected in the community, at least at the moment.
However, the virus is more pathogenic than infected HCoV in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
The time will determine whether the virus will be fully adapted to humans and spread among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the origins of animals that cause HCoV, it is better to discuss the definitions and characteristics of HCoV hosts of evolution, nature, reservoirs, intermediaries and reproduction.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host for HCoV if it has a very close heir who shares a high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The hereditary virus usually adapts well and is not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, reservoir hosts store HCoV continuously and for the long term.
In both cases, the host is usually infected naturally and is a natural host for HCoV or its virion.
On the other hand, if a new HCoV is introduced to an intermediate host before or around its introduction to humans, the virus does not adapt well to a new host and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a role as a breeding host by allowing the virus to temporarily double and then spreading the virus to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoV can develop a dead-way infection if it is unable to maintain its infectiousness in the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and also create a long-term subsidy.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveals retrospectively that cases of the SARS index have a history of contact with prey animals.
Further seroprevalence investigations showed that animal sellers had a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV IgG than the general public.
The larval weasels (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market were first identified as carrying a virus such as SARS-CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV.
This is backed up indirectly by the fact that no SARS is reported anymore after killing all the ferrets on the market.
However, it has been reported that lamb ferrets from forests or farms without exposure to the live animal market are mostly SARS-CoV-negative, suggesting that lambry ferrets may only be hosts strengthening intermediates but not natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV.
Most significantly, given that 80% of different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that various species of small mammals may also be an intermediate strengthening host for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All this seems to be a dead road host for SARS-CoV.
A further search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, dubbed the HKU3 CoV (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) Rhinolophus bat, which exists in Chinese bats.
This bat is positive for SARS-CoV antibody and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
These bats and other CoV bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
This study has provided the basis for a new concept that bat hosts produce human pathogens.
Several CoVs such as SARS (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none but one named WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) exchange enzyme is known as the receiver for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from a sample of bat feces was shown using bats, weasels and human ACE2 as receivers for cell entry.
More interestingly, SARS patients who are recovering have been found to be able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related offspring for SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus for SARS-CoV and bats are not a direct reservoir host for SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis puts MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV bats use the same host receptor, dipeptide peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
The sequence of RNA polymerase dependent RNA from MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to the virus in beta-CoV bats identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no living MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and the closest family of CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87% of nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be a direct reservoir host to MERS-CoV.
In contrast, studies in the Middle East have shown that arab camels have a positive effect on MERS-CoV-specific neutralization antibodies, much like camels in the Middle East originating from various African countries.
Living MERS-CoVs similar to viruses found in humans have been isolated through the nasal swabs of the arab camel, in turn showing that the camel serves as a pure MERS-CoV reservoir host.
It is also worth noting that generally mild symptoms but large decay of the virus have been observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
In particular, the infected camel releases the viruses not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-mouth passage, which is also the route for the virus to be released from the bat.
However, the question remains since many confirmed cases of MERS had no history of contact with camels before symptoms began, possibly linked to human-to-human dispersal routes or unknown dispersal routes involving unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% homologous nucleotides with CoV RaTG13 bats isolated from rhinolophus affinis bats.
In cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence deviation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the parent relationship.
In a sense, bats may not be the closest reservoir host to SARS-CoV-2 unless a similar bat coV is found in the future.
Perhaps, the intermediate animal host to SARS-CoV-2 is of a wild species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which is linked to many of the early cases of COVID-19, indicating a possible animal-to-human spread event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a small threatened group of mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also store the hereditary beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This pangolin CoV genome shares 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped in two sub offspring of a virus such as SARS-CoV-2 in a pilogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RDB) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In real differences, RBD from SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is more divergent, despite having a higher degree of genome-wide homology sequence.
Previous studies of infected pangolins also reported detection of viral contiguous from lung samples, which were later found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a method of collecting and selecting a manual array to generate partial genome sequences that make up about 86.3% of the full viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from pangolins due to the divergence of the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV in relation to SARS-CoV-2 pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associated with SARS-COV-2 pangolin.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be established.
While the highest sequence of homology has been found in RBD between SARS-COV-2 and pangolins, beta-CoV is associated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG12 which share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
Strong speculations suggest that the high-level similarities between RBD from beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 are driven by selectively focused evolution.
A counter proposal favors a recombination between the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV pangolin and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As the driving force of evolution, re-establishment occurs widely in beta-CoV.
Studies are still being done on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoV, while virions of HCoV-OC43 and HCov-HKU1 have been found in mice.
It has been reported that bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American three-color bats showed a close association with HCoV-NL63.
In contrast, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which has been detected in Ghana, while camelid has also been suspected of being an intermediate host.
To be more clear, current knowledge of the animal origins of the known HCoV is formulated in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for HCoV transmission events between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E transmission between species is vague.
But bat alpha-CoV that is closely related to HCoV-229E has been found.
One of them is Alpha-CoV.
Some lines of evidence support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpacas may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alpha-CoV associated with HCoV-229E is diverse and not pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV triggers respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpacas are not found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is not possible to exclude the alpha-CoV-related HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not too surprising that bats can directly transfer HCoV-229E to humans.
Alternatively, even if bat alpha-CoV becomes a subgenre of HCoV-229E, alpaka and arab camel may be intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is the best example of the transmission between species from bats to Arabian camels and from Arabian camels to humans.
The original evolution of MERS-CoV from bats is known at the beginning of the introduction and has been reinforced with subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide virus species densities for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and transmission between species.
Long life, densely packed colonies, close social interaction and strong flying ability are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal 'virus spreader'.
In addition, MERS-CoV has been introduced to the Arabian camel for decades.
It adapts well to these camels which have changed from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is unintentional and humans remain the final host to MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the function of the camel in the spread of MERS-CoV, the function of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
Primarily, beta-CoV pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the final host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, similar to ferrets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Some possibilities for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animals to humans should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, bats can be the reservoir host for the SARS-CoV-2-related virus that is almost the same as SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolins can be one of the newly identified intermediate booster hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Humans are infected with the virus through slaughter and feeding on game animals.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, are exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
A review of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is required.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of host animals, the three main factors on the part of the virus are also important in making it easier for CoVs to pass through species barriers.
First, relatively high mutation rates in RNA doubling.
Compared to single-breed RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoV can be considered as "simple" to "high" with the average exchange rate being <0x7E>10-4 exchanges per year per 2 sites, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to the novel host.
CoV has a proof reading exoribonucleases, its blackout causes very high variability and weakening or possibly lack of vitality.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog of Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV multiplication through the inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the best anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of CoV is about a million times higher than that of its host.
In addition, mutation rates are often high when the CoV does not adapt well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation rates, mutation rates on SARS-CoV-2 appear to be low, suggesting high levels of adaptation to humans.
Perhaps he has adapted to other hosts who are close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV, which adapts well to the arab camel.
In theory, it is unlikely that a genetic shift will make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in a short period of time.
Second, the largest RNA genome in CoV uses additional plasticity in genome changes for mutations and recombination, increasing the probability of shared evolution between species, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoV when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by a large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3' end of the genome.
Thirdly, CoVs change templates randomly and frequently during RNA multiplication through a unique "pick-up" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixed container, the exchange of suffocation often occurs during transcription of RNA CoV.
Very homologous subgenomous and full RNA can be recombined to produce a new CoV.
Natural phylogenetic evidence of incorporation has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in CoV animals such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
The interaction of the host virus is related to transmission.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptors is another major factor that affects transmission between species.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a special example, which also shows evidence of positive choice during interspecies transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of human isolation and ferret SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in RBD in S protein.
Generally, RBD in the S protein on CoV interacts with the cells and is strongly selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as a shared receptor for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of identifying ACE2 receptors from a variety of animals, including bats, ferrets, rats and raccoons, allowing the spread of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed as distinct from human and fertilizing viruses in RBD and 4 of them were located in receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV weasels have K479N and S487T mutations in their RBD, which may increase the association of random protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, both amino acid exchanges may be important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same receptor cells as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein affects that the bond between this S protein and human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, cryo-EM research shows this bonding relationship is 10 to 20 times higher than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other co-receptor may be needed for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
More interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with different S parts.
There are many other existing HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and sialic acid 9-O for HCoV-OC43.
It may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after transmission between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receivers, the consequences of transmission between HCoV species also depend on host dependence and other barrier factors.
The difference between humans and HCoV natural reservoir hosts such as bats, Arabian camels and rodents may create a barrier to transmission between species.
HCoV needs to seize the host dependency factor and subversive the host restriction factor for successful interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular determinants in important regions of these viral-hos interactions have yet to be identified and characterized.
Screening around unbiased genomes for host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may come to fruition.
The rise of the novel HCoV: back to the beginning
The diversity of bat CoV provides an extensive opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoV.
In this respect, bat CoV acts as a pool of HCoV genes.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein encoding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered as important in adapting to humans, as the bat-related virus SARS-CoV has been isolated but has been found to encode split ORF8 proteins.
Characteristics of SARS-CoV nucleotide-29 suppression have been found in strains isolated at the beginning of human epidemics.
This outage separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptation mutation that promotes host exchange.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with descendants of alpha and gamma CoVs, of which a large number of smaller recombination areas have been identified in RNA polymerase depending on RNA.
The location of the recombination is also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10 and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to experience a recombination event between different breeds, which occurs in arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the incidence of recombination was also observed in other HCoVs, which saw HCoV re-joining with other animal CoVs in its non-structural genes.
A warning should also be given that false selection can contribute to accidental changes in the viral genome, which are most likely to result from freeing the virus from the pressure of the selection imposed, such as by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototyping, as a result of the deletion of two nucleotides.
While strong ORF4 can be seen in the bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaka displays the insertion of a single nucleotide, which produces a skeletal shift.
Finally, the evolution of the novel HCoV was also spurred by the pressure of selection in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or mild symptoms alone have been detected when the bat is infected with CoV, signaling a co-adjustment between the CoV and the bat.
It seems that bats adapt well to CoV anatomically and psychologically.
For example, damage in the activation of pro-inflammatory responses in bats efficiently reduces the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is inhibited as a result of increased regulation of NKG2/CD94 inhibitory natural killer cell receptors and low levels of expression for class 1 molecules of the major histokeserasian complex.
Furthermore, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can both withstand the doubling of CoV and affect the reading of pruritus by exoribonuclease, thus exerting selective pressure for the care of highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced to new hosts.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three novel HCoVs have appeared in the past two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
It doubles rapidly without triggering a strong host immune response.
This is where the secret cause of asymptomatic carriers is seen and the cause for severe cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms are mostly due to the activation of hyper immune response and cytokine storms where the stronger the immune response, the worse the damage to the lungs.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been decoupled from the doubling of CoV.
The same strategy that binds to the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is very strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type 1 interferon at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammasome in the bat is ineffective.
For this reason, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammatory with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a common theme of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although bat beta-CoV that shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also bat CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although ferrets and other animals on the market have been found to have a virus similar to SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
A highly homologous beta-CoV pangolin with SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, signaling that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts or beta-CoV pangolins may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by humans intentionally or unintentionally.
CoV has returned to the spotlight as a result of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoV in bats and other animals has drastically changed our view of the original importance of zoonotic and animal reservoirs for HCoV in human transmission.
Thorough evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have bat origins and are transferred to humans through intermediate hosts.
As SARS-CoV infection stems from human contact with ferrets in the market, closing the wet market and killing ferrets should effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolins should be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, due to the discovery of multiple offspring of beta-CoV pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the weather and the way SARS-CoV-2 is transferred to humans through pangolins and other mammals need to be explained in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in arab camels for a long time.
This camel has become an important tool for transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and fur products for the local community.
This camel is found throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as is claimed in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the re-contagion of the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, which is combined with other infection control measures.
Since we can't get rid of this virus, a new genotype may appear to cause an outbreak.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs are scattered in the forest.
In particular, bat coV with zoonotic potential is very diverse.
There are many opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and regroup, causing the emergence of new CoVs that are more contagious and/or can kill in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be stopped to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better supply and response plans should be created.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet a long time ago.
The virus remains in its natural reservoir until it has a chance to spread.
Although bats have many features that facilitate the spread of the virus, human opportunities to have contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if communities are educated to stay away from such animals.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans as well as future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonotic virus is with humans shunting the ecological nic of natural reservoirs for zoonotic viruses.
Some of the questions about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remain unanswered.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 legacy virus to pangolins, it's definitely interesting to see how bats and pangolins can share the same ecological nics.
Second, if bats play a more important role in human transmission, we must determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate host, the way it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins needs to be explained.
Finally, as many mammals including exotic animals may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and infection experimentally should be carried out.
Whether it's bats, pangolins or other mammals, it's expected that SARS-CoV-2 or a similar hampri parent virus will be identified in its natural host in the future.
The ongoing investigation in this area will explain the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "certified cases" for COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team has published a quick advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline provides our sera experience as a good reference to fight this pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are slowly increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical practice experience; therefore, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we have responded to a review on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-10 a pandemic.
In order to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick guideline of advice and the guide has been published in Military Health Research Feb 06, 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing slowly based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies to be updated on an ongoing basis.
For example, the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, has released a total of seven editions with some contexts being fundamentally altered.
Now that our guidelines have received reviews by Zhou et al., they are introducing easy scoring recommendations based on their clinical experience.
Their efforts add new evidence to our guidelines and are also a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We recognize their important efforts and thank them.
However, their efforts also require updates in accordance with the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh edition of the trial) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case requires a combination of any one item of epidemiological historical characteristics with two clinical manifestation items to produce a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to meet three clinical manifestation items if without a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of travel or living in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days before symptoms began; (2) the history of contact with SAR-CoV-2 case infections (with a positive test of nucleic acid); (3) the history of relating to patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported within 14 days before symptoms began; (4) the history of contact with SAR-CoV-2 cases (withinjectives)
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with the characteristic imaging of COVID-19 infection; (3) the number of white blood cell count indicates normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte count in the initial stage.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should rely on the suspected case with any one pathogenic item or serological evidence as follows: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the genome sequence of the entire virus indicates high homogeneity to a known novel coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 in a serum exchange; or
We can see that real-time PCR tests for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples have been added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions.
Pathogenic detection of blood samples has been put to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020); and later serological evidence put to the seventh edition.
The modification is based on the ongoing work of researchers looking for the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for immediate detection, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which increase the availability of different specimens, and support bringing specific antibody positive results into the criteria that have been confirmed.
In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that reminds us to be alert to typical or asymptomatic symptomatic patients.
Therefore, flow charts from Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify invidivus without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system should also be verified in practice and further clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come and call on readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we propose to track and comply with the new guidelines of their country of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh had confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death toll in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Epidemic Studies (IEDCR) reported a record number of infections including 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases sitting at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over the age of 60, two of them 51 and 60, and 41-50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID 19 a pandemic on March 11.
Hospital officials told a local news source, Anadolu Agency, that one of the infected was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, which is being treated at Kuwait's Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Road and Bridge Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be closed longer than the original plan, until next Saturday.
The closure of public transport was originally due to begin on March 26 and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential goods -- medicines, oil and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded COVID-19 infection incident in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two people returning from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, all three have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, an outbreak caused by the coronavirus.
This benchmark was present on the same day Malawi confirmed the first coronavirus infection and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related deaths.
North Korea claims that, as of Thursday, it is among the few countries that are free from coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours ahead of 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, accounting for at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS news reported, quoting from Johns Hopksins University data, more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. on Wednesday from coronavirus infection.
Worldwide, countries are announcing stricter measures to stop the outbreak from spreading.
On Thursday, Sergie Sobyanin, the head of the city of Moscow, extended the city's closure until May 1.
Across the country, President Vladimir Putin said Russians may continue to be paid salaries without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the state of emergency to 15 days; the vote was confirmed with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions, and one abstentions.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Makkah and Medina to the rest of the day; previously, the curfew was only carried out between 3pm and 6am.
Thailand plans to carry out a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia have lowered the limits of toilet paper once in a transaction.
On Sunday evenings and Saturdays, the Australian store chain Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase restrictions on toilet paper to two and a one-time package of transactions at all stores at the national level.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit, on Monday.
This limit is broadcast as an order on the exit list, and on the chain's Facebook page.
Buyers reportedly buy stocks due to fears of COVID-19 if individuals need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for the purchase of home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes followed a four-pack restriction for each transaction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in a March 8 press release, reported that with the implementation of the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery", and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales rose in a "sudden rise" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packs last week.
To further ease the shortage, Coles booked larger packages than suppliers and increased the frequency of shipments, Woolworths booked additional stocks, while ALDI made stock for special Wednesday plans available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers were trying to add stock but local council restrictions at the time of delivery by trucks made it difficult.
He expects an increase in the cost of the product, as the supplier tries to meet the demand, and a bit of a special one.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the initial production of the stock, some stores could not carry out special Wednesdays.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the store filled stock every night.
He told toilet paper was a large item, leading to a low quantity on the amount of stock, and, when sold out, left a large shelf space empty, further strengthening the feeling of inadequacy.
Coles and Woolworths have a view [that] if there is a variety of items on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and decoction can be [bought] and have quantities, you'll probably reduce the panic, Russell Zimmerman said on ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap on Wednesday has run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper who made Sorbent, insisted that they work 24/7 to maintain supplies, according to a New.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported some real estate sellers were offering toilet paper for free to the first bidders at an auction session in Melbourne, when a small auction was held as buyers faced with time off during the long day off Workers' Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily print in Darwin, included eight additional pages intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Shops were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3, which saw them saying they had no plans to introduce limits on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, decoction materials, dry food, hand washing tools and flooring.
Similarly outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the Ocado online supermarket was seen to limit the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) on-going COVID-19 outbreak — a disease stemming from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent to which the disease has spread, not how dangerous the particular case is, WHO is aware of the need to urge governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of the pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people to act, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
We are very concerned about both the level of transmission and the severity of the worrisome as well as the level of inaction that is worrisome.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was "unprecedented."
He said, in a quote published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected from the emergence of a continuous worldwide transmission."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we've never before seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, "and we've never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to announce the outbreak as an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "in short, things will get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, causing more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, announced as a General Health Emergency at the International Level on January 30, 2020, and declared as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, causing about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been healed.
Case mortality rates have been estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide between 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may be between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic therapy and support. Proposed preventive measures include hand washing, shutting your mouth during coughing, maintaining distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for those who suspect themselves to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, lockdowns, workplace hazard control and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to global socioeconomic disruptions, suspension or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as a widespread shortage of supplies driven by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed either nationwide or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, others of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, as well as those from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and heavy industrial closures, there was a decrease in air pollution as well as carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases from an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases are related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and cause the virus to be suspected to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak was known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronavirus, pangoling coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The earliest people known to have the symptoms were later found to have fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no visible contact with the later wet market cluster.
For the initial cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case traced back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old patient from Hubei province, may be the first case.On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, during a new case reported according to China but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a corresponding number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among adolescents, with those aged 19 and under equaling 2.4% of cases worldwide. The United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the British population should be infected before effective group immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose tests have been tested positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test those with mild symptoms only, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections have not been detected, and that these unrecorded infections are the source for 79% of recorded cases.
Statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the number increase (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not, the time of development of symptoms until death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5 about 80% of deaths are among those over the age of 60, and 75% have existing health problems including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official death count from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to the dead who have tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who died without being tested - e.g. at home, in a care center, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excessive deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated "We know that [the number of deaths stated] is less approximation", a statement backed by anecdotal reports of under-calculations in the U.S.. Less such approximations occur frequently in pandemics, such as during the 2009 H1N1 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country have been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica. Several measures have been used commonly to specify the number of deaths.
This figure varies by area and time, as well as being affected by the number of tests, quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The mortality ratio with cases illustrates the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within the given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the ratio of deaths with global cases was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The numbers vary by area.
In China, estimates for mortality ratios with cases decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms ranging from 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms starting after 1 February 2020).Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which describes the percentage of those diagnosed as dying from the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which describes the percentage of those infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate this number for a specific population.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall infection mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top estimate for this range is consistent with results from the first randomised test for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the test's effects on the CFR estimate.
WHO says the pandemic is under control.
The duration of the peak and peak of the outbreak is uncertain and can vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Allowed unchecked, the infectious epidemic is usually flat and then begins to decline when the disease runs out of available housing.
But it's almost impossible to make any reasonable predictions now about when that situation will occur."
China's senior government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "the pandemic could end by June" if all countries could be mobilized to comply with WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Tropical Hygiene & Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, perhaps for a year or two".
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (perhaps 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I don't think it's possible that this coronavirus - because it's so contagious - will disappear completely" and that it "may be a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The danger of re-emergence will depend on the immunity of the group and the stage of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and the infected person may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of respiratory sputum, loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, sore muscles and joints, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, hemoptosis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become very sick and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists the symptoms of anxiety as difficulty breathing, pain or pressure on the chest persistent, shock confusion, difficulty in waking up, and eyes or lips becoming bluish; immediate medical treatment is advised if these symptoms are present. The increase in the disease can further lead to severe penumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, shock.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results confirming infection, so researchers have issued advice that those with close contact to an infected person should be closely monitored and checked to ensure there is no infection.
China estimates the asymptomatic ratio ranges from slightly to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms begins) ranges from one to 14 days; most commonly five days.For example, the estimated breakdown of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell at first 30% and then decrease to 15%.
Some details about the way the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through small drops that result during coughing, sneezing, or talking; with close contact being at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that an unprotected cough will cause drops of ai to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus may also be transferable through small drops that remain for longer periods of time in the air, which may be generated during speech. Breathing drops may also result during exhalation, including during speech, although the virus is not generally airborne.
The droplets may land in the mouth or nose of a nearby person or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the secretion of respiratories to become sprayed and therefore result in an air-borne spread.
The virus can also spread when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then they touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns the virus can spread through stool, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, but the infection may occur before symptoms appear and at a later stage for the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggest that transmission can occur before the presence of noticeable symptoms.
Few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact detection investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not very clear how easily the disease spreads, one usually infects two to three others. The virus remains for hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for a day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British authorities advise washing hands after touching animals, such as after touching other surfaces that may have been touched by those infected.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the novel characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in relation to coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which destroys its protective cover.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B lineage) along with two entrails obtained from bats.
The virus is 96% similar at the full genome stage with another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in a specific portion of the genome sequence between viruses from pangolins to viruses from humans.
Whole genome differences have so far found at most 92% of genetic material is shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove pangolin as an intermediate host.
Infections by the virus can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, although the tracer eventually undergoes reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for the secretion of infected or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with most of its imaging features overlapping with the processes of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used to screen or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-1, with the first issued on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be performed on a respiratory sample or blood sample.
Test results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
Usually this test is carried out with a nasopharyngeal swab but an esophagus swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests have been proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the U.S. serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging features in radiographs and computerized tomography (CT) of the symptomatic oang include asymmetric peripheral ground glass effusion and missing pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an intercontinental online database to find imaging for confirmed cases.
As a result of overlapping with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging tnpa confirmation by PCR has limited specialization in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT with PCR and showed that although imaging was less specific for infections, the method was faster and more sensitive, suggesting consideration of the method as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect viral imaging with both radiographs and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing on the tissue and putting the tissue directly into the trash container.
Those who may have already been infected have been advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also proposed to prevent transmission. Many governments have blocked or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some community members do not know the place or the way they are infected. Healthcare providers who care for a person who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact detection is an important method to determine the source of the infection and to avoid further transmission.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for a limit on this surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log near one user with another cell phone.
The user then receives a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and rinsing with mouthwash is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop the vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the plague.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly using soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands look dirty; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which destroys its protective bubbles.
The CDC further recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by content when soap and water are not available for use.
WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surface may be contaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to disinfectants for stainless steel surfaces), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidon-iodin.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate crohexidine, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if COVID cases are suspected or confirmed in facilities such as offices or day-care centers, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, general areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines used by sick people, should be decriminalized.
Health organizations recommend that people close their mouths and noses with their arms bent or tissue during coughing or sneezing, and remove any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing masks can limit the amount and distance of travel of expiratory drops that are spread while talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene care."
WHO has recommended the wearing of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those taking care of people with COVID-19, although they also admit that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by community members.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made from cloth. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy community members, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia bans going out into public places without wearing a mask or covering one's nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government decreed that everyone entering the grocery store must wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks every day since mid-March, asked commuters of intercity trains and buses to wear a face mask on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going out, while also recommending making a face mask at home for those who can't afford a face mask.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is accompanied by infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greeting, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments now require or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum recommended assembly size by U.S. government bodies and health organizations is rapidly reduced from 250 people (in the absence of known COVID-19 transmission in the province) to 50, and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings by more than two people. Older adults and those with hidden health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face an increased risk for serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas with community outbreaks. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term “incarcercern” physically.
The use of the term “social imprisonment” has led to the implication that people should undergo full social isolation, rather than encouraging them to get in touch with others through alternative means. Some have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This includes a suggestion to have sex only with someone who lives with you, who does not have the virus or the symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been suggested to those detected with COVID-19 and those suspected to have been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or proposed self-quarantine to the entire population living in the affected areas.
The most stringent self-quarantine directives have been issued to those who belong to the high-risk group.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have previously traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to undergo self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of possible last exposure.
The strategy in controlling outbreaks is to contain or suppress, and reduce.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the pandemic and aims to track and isolate those infected and introduce other infection and vaccination control measures to stop the disease from spreading to the remaining populations.
When it is no longer possible to curb the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the reintroduction stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the health care system as well as society.
The combination of containment and reduction measures may be carried out at the same time.
Pressure requires more decisive measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of managing the transmission of infectious diseases is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services becoming overloaded and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage contagion include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing a face mask, and self-quarantine; community measures targeted at physical distancing such as closing schools and canceling mass gathering events; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures are targeted to curb contagion have been taken after China's implementation.
Other countries are also taking various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and local quarantine, as well as issuing warnings about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provides financial support to those infected who quarantine themselves and impose high fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and fined the presentation of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States showed that the reduction (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the emphasis (resulting the growth of the epidemic) had a major challenge.
The optimal reduction policy may reduce health care claims that peak at 2/3 and deaths by half, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems to be burdened.
Tackling can be an option but should be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it comes first), as the spread will immediately bounce back when preventive measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic result in social and economic costs.
No antiviral drugs have been specifically approved for COVID-19, but efforts to develop them are under way, including testing existing drugs.
Eating a cold medicine given over the counter, drinking water and resting will help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid and respiratory support may be required.
Steroid use may worsen the consequences.
Some compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in treating COVID-19.
WHO also noted that some "traditional and at-home treatments" can provide relief to symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increasing capacity and adaptation of healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by WHO as a fundamental measure of the pandemic response.
The ECDC and WHO European regional offices have issued guidelines for major hospitals and healthcare services to move resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures when necessary, separating and alienating COVID-19 positive patients, as well as improving intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are various theories about where the first case (the so-called empty number patient) came from.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei was slowly increasing.
The case is mostly associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, has zoonotic origins. The pulmonary cluster of unknown causes was observed on December 26 and treated by Zhang Jixian's doctor at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues about "coronaviruses such as SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were alerted by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was scolded by his superiors for raising the matter.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the WHO.
Adequate unknown cases of pneumonia have been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubles approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other parts of China, aided by the migration of the Chinese New Year and Wuhan to become a major transportation hub as well as a major railway exchange.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later showed that 6,174 people had already shown symptoms on January 20, 2020. As of March 26, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 people had recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and implemented border controls.
As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are under a form of emergency in the United States, more than 50 million people are in an emergency in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in a state of emergency in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are in a state of emergency in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in a state of emergency, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later—about one-third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID 19 has been traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests the earliest case was on 17 November.
Doctor Zhang Jixiang observed a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases on Dec. 26, then his hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on Dec. 27.
Early genetic tests for patient samples on December 27, 2019 showed the presence of coronaviruses such as SARS.
Public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was notified on the same day.
At the time of this notification, doctors in Wuhan were alerted by police for "spreading rumours" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later described by Chinese Communist Party chief secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to prevent the spread of the virus.
In what has been dubbed the "largest quarantine in human history", a quarantine siege was announced on January 23 that halted travel into and out of Wuhan, which has been extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting at least 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebration (January 25) was cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was built afterwards, Leishenshan Hospital, to handle additional patients.
Apart from the newly built hospital, China also renovated 14 other facilities in Wuhan such as convention centers and stadiums, into a temporary hospital. On January 26, the government began the next step to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing a health declaration for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Schools and universities across the country are also closed.
The provinces of Hong Kong and Macau initiated several measures, in particular regarding schools and universities.
Working remotely has begun in some parts of China.
Travel restrictions are planned inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport has been modified, and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
Public movement control has been implemented in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) are faced with some kind of external restrictions. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese government took strict steps to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has enforced a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On March 23, the Mainland of China was only one case of deployment within the country within 5 days, in this example the traveler returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that cases of domestic transmission were basically blocked and the transmission was controlled by China.
The same-day travel restrictions have been eased in Hubei, other than from Wuhan, two months after the emergency came into force. China’s Minister of Foreign Affairs announced on March 26, 2020 that entry through visa or resident permit holders will be suspended from March 28 onwards, without specific details about the time when this policy will expire.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and the provision of financial stimulus packages to firms. The State Council declared a day of mourning beginning with three minutes of silent time at 10:00 April 4, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the federal government asked families to show respect online as complying with physical distancing to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak from recurring.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
The national health agency reported a significant rise in confirmed cases on Feb. 20, largely linked to a rally in Daegu from a new religious movement known as the Jesus Shincheonji Church.
Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the cause of the outbreak.
As of February 22, among the 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 people or about 13% reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level alert on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 cases on February 29.
All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after tests confirmed that three military personnel tested positive for the virus.
The airline's schedule was also affected and therefore the schedule was changed. South Korea introduced what is considered the world's most targeted and most organized program to screen the population for detecting the virus, and isolate any infected individuals as well as track and quarantine people associated with them.
The screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of simptons by new international arrivals through mobile applications, driving virus testing with results available the next day, and an increase in test capabilities that allows up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's program is considered successful in controlling the outbreak even though it does not quarantine the entire city. The South Korean community initially split in response to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Most Koreans signed a petition demanding Moon's dismissal over what they claimed was government mishandling of the outbreak, or praising his response.

The U.S. administration under Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as "China virus" or "Wuhan virus" saying that "China's layer has produced a virus that is now turning into a global pandemic", which has subsequently been criticized by some critics as being racist and "trying to divert focus from its administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast acquired a U.S. government channel outlining the communication ruse with a clear origin in the National Security Council, with the strategy being referred to as "Everything is about China.
We are informed to try and ensure this message is disclosed in any way, including media conferences and appearances on television.

The source accused Russia of misappropriating "geopolitical and diplomatic" charms.
Lombardy's president Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected media reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent cargo planes with medical assistance to the United States.

South Korea criticized "unclear and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at a government-designated site.
South Korean society was initially unclear with President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition calling for Moon's dismissal of what the government deemed a mishandling of the pandemic, or praised his response. The pandemic has allowed the country to pass emergency laws in return.
Some commentators have voiced concern that the move will allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.

The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several instances of undersupply, stemming from the use of equipment to fight the growing epidemic around the world, panic buying, and disruption to factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand as well as supplier disruptions.
Several areas have also seen panic buying that causes slippery shelves of essential goods such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, causing a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand has led to a price increase of up to twenty times the usual price and has also caused a delay in supply of medical items for four to six months.
It has also led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, with the WHO warning that this would endanger the health of workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
The activity has led to a lack of infant formula in some supermarkets and has been banned by the Australian government before. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan province, as well as the continued high demand for food products, both areas have survived severe food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy to counter the accumulation of goods and illegal sales of essential products have been successful, avoiding the severe food shortages that have been expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with significant agricultural production did not see a large reduction, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves only happen temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials are releasing pig stockpiles to ensure adequate nourishment for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
Damage to the global economy has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 as a result of measures taken by the government to control the spread of the virus, and retail sales plummeted by 20.5%.
Given that China's mainland is a major economic and production hub, the virus outbreak has been seen to pose a threat that disrupts major stability to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economic Intelligence Unit has predicted that the market will stay up and down until a clearer image emerges about potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that an economic collapse due to the epidemic on world growth could surpass the state of the SARS outbreak in 2002-2004.
One estimate from experts at Washington University in St. Louis has an impact of $300<0x2B> billion on the world supply chain that can last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reportedly "horrified" after falling oil prices due to lower demand from China.
The global stock market fell on February 24 as a result of a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, as a result of heightened concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index, the Dow Jones Industry Average reported the worst fall since 2008, with the Dow 1,191 points, the biggest fall in a day since the financial crisis in 2007-08.
All three indexes ended the week with a decline of more than 10%.
On February 28, the GmbH Scope Assessment confirmed China's ability to rate credit values, but maintained a Negative Survey.
Stocks fell due to fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall on March 16.
A lot of people think there is going to be an economic downturn.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the central and state bank's timely emergency measures.
The central bank responded faster than they did during the 2008 financial turmoil.
Tourism is the sector hardest hit by travel bans, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and the government's recommendation not to travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while regional airlines in British Flybe have been buried.
The impact on the cruise ship industry is at a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic occurred coincidentally during Chunyun, a massive travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several public events have been cancelled by the state and provincial governments, including the annual New Year festival, with private companies also independently closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and parties at traditional temples.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and territories, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to February 10, ordering all workplaces not to reopen until that date.
The region represents 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the rate of infection response to the disease to the highest level and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled the New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reduced business hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers saw a 50-60% fall.
This also caused a 33-43% drop in walking traffic to the mall in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world are implementing additional measures, e.g. improving hygiene, installing heat scanners to check visitor temperatures, and canceling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, pandemic-driven recessions can cause an additional between 14 and 22 million people to experience extreme poverty in Latin America compared to those in that situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of China’s nearly 300 million migrant workers have been stranded at home in rural areas or trapped in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could eliminate 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to an estimate by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. The emergency in India has left tens of millions of foreign workers in India (paid by daily pay) out of work. A survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some kind of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost jobs in Spain since it underwent a state of emergency in mid-March 2020.
By mid-March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary non-working benefits and 1 million British employees applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany had sent their employees to a government-subsidized short-term employee scheme known as Kurzarbeit.
Short-term work compensation schemes have been implemented by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sector has been deeply impacted by the pandemic, impacting the organization's operations as well as individuals - both working payroll and free-to-work - around the world.
Arts and culture sector organizations try to enhance their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to society, maintain the safety of their workers and society, and support artists whenever possible.
As of March 202, around the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions have closed exhibitions, hosting events and shows cancelled and postponed to an indefinite time.
In the feedback, there are intensive measures to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and growing fallout as a result of the pandemic is the cancellation of religious services, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology seminars, and fashion shows.
The film industry was also affected. The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of Lent's Christian repentance season, had been cancelled.
Many bishops have suggested older Christians to sit at home rather than attend the Church Ceremony on Sundays; some churches have held church services via radio, live stream online or television while others offer past drive worship.
With the Roman Catholic Bishop of Rome closing churches and small churches and St. Peter's squares vacated from the Christian congregation, other religious bodies also canceled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and synagogues.
Iran's health minister announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and the tombs were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia barred foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused significant disruptions to sports calendars around the world since World War II.
Most major sporting events have either been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak affected plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled to a date after 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021". Casinos and gambling locations around the world have closed as well as live poker matches have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has caused many gambling feet to turn online, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in their new registration rates. The entertainment world has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling tour concerts.
Many large theaters such as Broadway theaters also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing works over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to present, distribute and introduce their work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed Internet memes have spread as many have turned to jokes and entertainment behind the uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, growing prejudices, xenophobia and racism have been observed against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hot locations in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and rudeness have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) have recorded racist sentiments portrayed in various groups around the world saying Chinese people deserve the virus or receive the thing allegedly in retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Most residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discriminatory based on their home territory.
There is support for China, both online and offline, as well as against them in areas badly hit by the virus.
Due to the development of the outbreak into a new hot area country, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, can also be the victims of suspicion and xenophobaia. People in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed a lobbying petition to ban Chinese citizens from entering the country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan went viral on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported levels of racist harassment, as well as increased attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "China Virus", a term that critics regard as racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign migrants from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, who share borders with China, and study in India's major cities have reported experiencing disruptions related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party State unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese people have destroyed the environment and "that's why God avenges their deeds."
The statement was later denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents have been fueled by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign trash" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers with paid ads have released it for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make pandemic-related scientific papers available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share their results immediately on preprinted servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods for detecting the presence of the virus as well as methods that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The test is used to confirm a very new or active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show the number of patients who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report or who are asymptomatic.
The exact rate of death due to disease and the level of group immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
As a result of limited testing, as of March 2020 no country has any data that can be expected about the prevalence of the virus in their population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of their population, and there is considerable diversity in the number of tests that have been conducted across countries.
This diversity is also likely to significantly affect the death rate of reported cases, which may be significantly estimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) real-time tests can be performed on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples.
The decision is usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests performed with an esophagus swab are only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Then the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For those infected tested in the second minngu, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from within the airway in using an inhalation catheter or a cough-causing material (sputum) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at Charit<0xC3><0xA9> in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription of polymerase (rRT-PCR) reactions, and became the basis for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom has also developed tests by January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit, a chilinical grade (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kits. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the RT-PCR Revolvent Diagnos Panel
One in three genetic tests in the old version of the test kit resulted in uncertain results due to faulty reagents, and bottle neck tests at the CDC in Atlanta; this results in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020;
Tests using two components cannot be confirmed to be reliable until February 28, 2020, and before then state and local laboratories are allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. The U.S. commercial laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020 LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 tests available nationwide starting March 9, 2020.
No quantity limit has been announced; specimen collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test has been developed and produced by the VECTOR State Virology and Biotechnology Research Center.
On 11 February 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health. On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for tests that could be performed within 3.5 hours in high numbers, thus allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hoologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for a test that lasted about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests using isothermal nucleic acid enlargement technology instead of PCR.
As this test does not require a series of variable temperature cycles this method can give a positive result in as little as five minutes and a negative result in as little as 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to speed up production to deliver 50,000 tests a day. Tests using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to novel novel novel nucleocapsid (N protein) proteones are being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that the test can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes just like a rapid influenza test.
In March 2020 a review of the paper concluded that "chest radiographs have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, while the discovery of CT [computerized anatomy] may have been present even before symptoms began."
Typical features of CT include the opacity of dual multilobar ground glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distributions.
The dominance of the subpleura, the opening of the craze and the merging are formed when the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its imaging features acting with the processes of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American Radiological College recommends that "CT should not be used to filter or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infection in an individual starting 7 days or so after symptoms begin, to determine immunity, and in population surveillance. Assessment can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or through a point-of-care (PoCT) test.
High fluency automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to carry out this assessment but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
For CLT a single specimen of peripheral blood is usually used, although a serial specimen can be used to follow an immune response.
For PoCT a single specimen of blood is usually obtained through a puncture on the skin.
Unlike the PCR method of stratification measures are not required prior to evaluation. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provided the agency with the information as needed and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under the authorization of emergency use.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kit, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than conventional PCR assessment sites for viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the infection begins. In early April, the UK found that no antibody test kits purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has prepared a scheme that sees the suspected patient able to stay at home, "the emergency department will provide a sample tube to the patient", they spit into the tube, send it back and get a test result shortly thereafter. The British NHS has announced that it is piloting a scheme to take care of suspected cases at home, which removes the risk of the patient infecting another person if they go to hospital or need to disinfect the ambulance.
Last drive center has helped South Korea perform one of the fastest, most comprehensive tests compared to other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2, that they had a capacity of 12,000 tests per day in an ambulatory setting and 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
Expenses are borne by health insurance when the test is requested by a medical professional.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Jerrman has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, driving tests have been offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown, as only positive results have been reported.
The first laboratory survey revealed up to 12/2020 calendar week a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested including 12/2020 weeks and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested methods to test samples from 64 simultaneous patients, by collecting samples and only further testing if samples combined were found per square day.
With the construction monitored by BGI founder Wan Jian and taking 5 days, the model has shown the cases in Hubei will be 47% higher and the corresponding cost to handle quarantine will double if the test capacity does not reach the target.
Wuhan's lab was immediately overtaken by Hou Yan's labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020 the total daily volume is 50,000 tests per day. Open source, a multiplex design issued by Origami Assays has been released that can test as many as 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 assessments. This balanced design can be carried out in small laboratories without the need for robotic fluid operators.
As of March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents have made congestion for mass testing in the EU and in the UK and in the US.
This has prompted some authors to explore sample preparation protocols involving heating the sample at 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to remove the RNA genome for further testing.On March 31 it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was testing more of its people for Coronavirus per head than any other country, and was on the right path to increasing the scale of test levels to reach a large portion of the population.
This is through a combination of past-drive capabilities, and the purchase of a large-scale population-scale laboratory of processing power from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Hou-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first in the world on this scale to be operated outside China.
Different test cases targeting different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts the German method of producing kits sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German method was published on 17 January 2020; protocols developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control did not exist until 28 January, delaying existing testing in the U.S. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the test kit at the beginning of its trigger, and the country and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing by health experts.
On the other hand, experts say South Korea's widespread willingness to conduct tests helps reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The test capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for improving the testing program as the best way to slow the speed of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus led to the arrears of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and the supply of sweeps and chemical reagents became limited.
In March 2020 China reported a problem with accuracy on their test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "weakness"; the government later issued bureaucratic restrictions that had prevented private testing. The Spanish state bought the test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Biotechnology Co ltd, but found the results to be inaccurate.
The firm explains that the inaccurate results may be the result of failure to collect samples or use the kit correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would retract the kit that returned the wrong result, and would replace it with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased by the Chech Republic of China made the wrong decision. The Slovak state bought 1.2 million test kits from China which were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that this kit be thrown into the Danube.Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health told the test kits Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "use it". The UK country bought 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced these test kits could not be used.
The test, followed by quarantine of those tested positive and tracking those in contact with positive individuals of SARS-CoV-2 in, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the site of the first death of COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on an entire population of nearly 3,400 people, about a ten-day interval.
Nearly half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all of the cases found were quarantined.
With travel restrictions, this has eliminated new infections as a whole.
With aggressive contact tracking, entry travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has moved slower than other developing countries, but without strict restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and grocery stores.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun advising its citizens to stay at home on March 28, but schools will reopen in time after the March 23 holiday.
Several other countries have also controlled the pandemic by aggressively tracking contacts, entry travel restrictions, exams and quarantines, but with less aggressive emergency orders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a low mortality rate, possibly because these countries were able to detect those with only mild or no symptoms better.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have national test capacity and laboratories with limited experience of COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for verification tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are found in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "Positive as % of test" column is affected by the country's test policy.
Countries that only test individuals who are admitted to hospital will get a higher positive score as % of tests than countries that test all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the rest is the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands aimed at removing soil, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the transmission of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and year, which are spread through the passage of stool to the mouth.
Individuals can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
Five critical times during the day that witness washing hands with soap are important include: before and after defecating, after cleaning the child's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or birds.
If water and soap are not present, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after meals.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning children who have used the toilet.
After exhaling the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before handling medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in medicine, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the cause of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and lower the rate of infant mortality at birth at home.
A 2013 study showed improved hand washing practices would lead to a small increase in high growth in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, childhood mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, e.g. washing hands with soap.
This simple step can reduce the mortality rate from the disease to nearly 50%.
Interventions that organize hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes by about a third, and this can be compared to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in diarrhoea episodes can be attributed to washing hands with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to avoid diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI), as automatic behavior is performed at home, school and society around the world.
Pneumonia, the leading ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under the age of five, killing approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, the habit of washing your hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or drug mix, reduce deaths from diarrhea by almost half and die from acute respiratory infections by nearly a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary interventions as part of a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing can also protect against impetigo that is transferred through direct physical contact.
A minor adverse effect when washing your hands too often is that washing your hands too hard can lead to skin damage due to dryness on the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, a scaly skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among healthcare workers.
Too much hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day where washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the transfer of fecal matter into the mouth: after using the toilet (chicken, cockroaches), after cleaning the child's buttocks (swapping diapers), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or birds.
Other times when proper hand washing should be practiced to prevent the transmission of diseases including before and after treatment of cuts or wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or exhaling the nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after holding trash.
The rate of hand washing using soap is low in most countries.
In 2015, a handwashing study in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households had the practice of washing their hands with soap. In 2014, a study showed Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate of 23 percent. Some behavioral change methodology now exists to improve handwashing with soap at critical times. School students wash their hands in groups at designated times is one of choice.
The Essential Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large-scale action to promote the health and education of children.
Deworming twice a year, plus washing your hands daily with soap, and brushing your teeth daily with florida.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin can be increased by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier on the solution, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is not an efficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are insoluble in water.
However, proper drainage of water helps with cleaning..
Due to its reusable nature, ketul soap may store bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated ketul soap have found that transplants are unlikely to occur because bacteria are removed when washed with foam.
The CDC website still states "liquid soap removed without using hands is better".
Antibacterial soaps get a high promotion to people who are important to health.
There is no evidence so far that using antiseptics or disinfectants is recommended to choose antibiotic resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a broad list of resistance to strains of organisms.
So, although antibody-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective agents, this sophisticated formulation may contain acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and further skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, bulbs, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis from the Faculty of Public Health at the University of Oregon shows that regular soaps have the same effect as antibacterial soaps in the class of the user-containing.
Water is not too hot to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria reproduce faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to get rid of natural oils that have soil and bacteria.
Unlike many people believe, scientific studies show that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial content on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, non-water based hand cleaning agents (also known as alcohol-based rubbing, antiseptic hand rubbing, or hand sanitizer) began to become popular.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated alongside thickening agents such as carbomers (acrylic acid polymers) into gels, or humectants such as glycerin into liquids, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohols.
By adding diluted hydrogen peroxide will further increase antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient germ removers.
Alcohol stains kill bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub cleaners containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (a reduction of 3.5 logs, equal to a reduction of 35 decibels) bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% (a reduction of 4 to 5 logs) bacteria on the hands 1 minute after use. Hand sanitizer is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus type virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand antiseptics or alcohol rubs must be used to wet or protect both hands properly.
The front and back of both hands and between the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel becomes dry.
The fingertips must also be well washed, by rubbing them on both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than hand sanitizer rubs, especially when the hands look dirty.
The increased use of this agent is due to its simple use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms. However, it cannot replace proper hand washing except when there is no soap and water.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused a significant reduction in irritation and dryness of the skin compared to soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol coagulants or additives in alcohol hand rubs are rare.
The tendency to further reduce irritant contact dermatitis becomes an attraction rather than using soap and water to wash your hands.
Non-water agents, although effective, do not clean the hands of organic matter. It just disinfects.
This is why hand sanitizer is less effective than soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as the pathogen is still on the hands.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends heavily on its ingredients and formulations, and historically it has been less successful than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
In recent times, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohols that have been shown to decrease in effectiveness after use many times, possibly due to progressively incompatible reactions over the skin.
Most low-income people are unable to have soap, instead they use ash or soil.
Ash or soil may be more effective than using water alone but may be less effective than soap.
Concern exists if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms that may increase rather than reduce the spread of disease.
Ash is also a disinfectant agent such as soap because it forms an alkaline solution if it has contact with water.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap if soap is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends proper hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of the disease include the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because the standing glass may be contaminated, at the same time the temperature of the water does not appear to have any effect.
Wash the hands while rubbing them with a lot of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap compared to just water.
Sprinkle for at least 20 seconds.
The thickening creates a shift, which helps remove germs from the skin, and thickens with longer removing more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
rinsing in the glass can stain the hands again.
Dry it with a clean towel or let it be dried by air.
Wet and damp hands are easier to get dirty again. The thumbs, wrists, the part between the fingers and under the fingernails are the part that is always overlooked.
Microorganisms may be stored in fake nails and peeled nail polish.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent the hands from becoming dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transfer.
There are a variety of cheap options to facilitate hand washing in the absence of tap water and/or soap, e.g. pouring water from hanging cans or pumpkins with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. If water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as "tippi pipes" and other cheap options.
Tippi pipe is a simple technology that uses a jag suspended by a rope, and a lever operated by the foot to pour a little water over the hands and a piece of soap.
An important part of the hand cleaning process is effective hand drying, but there is debate about the most effective form of drying in public bathrooms.
More and more studies show paper towels are much cleaner than the electric hand dryer found in most bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of cleanliness when using paper towels, warm air hand dryers and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the amount of bacteria at the bottom of the fingertip was found to increase on average by 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Drying with jet air dryers led to an increase in the amount of bacteria at the bottom of the fingertips by an average of 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the amount of bacteria at the bottom of the finished end is on average reduced by up to 76% and on the palms by up to 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether cross pollutants could potentially occur from other bathroom users and the bathroom environment of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which exhales air out of the unit at an alleged speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of exhaling microorganisms out of the hands and units and potentially polluting other bathroom users and bathroom environments as far as 2 meters.
The use of a warm-air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels do not show the significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different hand drying methods.
The following changes are found in the bacterial count after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers compared to paper towels for drying.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative option when traveling when there is no soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing for medicine has long been an obligation when the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in avoiding disease in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that warn hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that its use can reduce the rate of infection.
Wash your hands in medicine for at least 15 seconds, using a lot of soap and water or gel to cushion and rub each part of the hand.
The hands need to be rubbed together with the fingers inserted in a stinging manner.
If there is dirt under the nail, a feather brush can be used to remove it.
Since the germs may remain in the water on the hands, we need to rinse them well and wipe them until dry with a clean towel.
After drying the hands, the paper towel should be used to cover the water (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting dirty again when touching the surface.
Hand washing in a healthcare environment aims to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid spreading them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that less permanent hand washing is at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, spreading microorganisms.
One study showed proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a document showing the standards of how to wash and rub hands in the healthcare sector.
A draft guide on hand hygiene by this organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review has been conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if a demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" for hand washing:
after being exposed to the blood/liquid body
prior to the aseptic duty, and
after treating the patient. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soap "medicated" or "antimicrobial") gives a killing action to the hand washing agent.
Such an act of killing may be desirable before surgery or in circumstances where antibiotic resistant organisms are very widespread. To 'wash' one's hands for surgical operations, there must be pipes that can be turned on and off without touching by hand, some chlorhexidine or iodine washes, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, and sterile brushes to rub and other sterile tools to clean under the fingernails.
All the jewelry needs to be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
A long brushing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinsing, the water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back to the hand.
After finishing washing hands, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical clothes are worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use antiseptics before and after treating the sick.
To control stylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from hand washing came from the first 20% washing, and very little added benefit was gained when the frequency of hand washing increased by more than 35%.
Washing with regular soap produces more than three times the rate of infectious diseases transferred to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing rubbing hands with an alcohol solution by washing hands with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds, each shows that rubbing hands with alcohol reduces bacterial pollution by 26% more than antibacterial soaps.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce influenza A H1N1 virus and Klostridium difisil spores from the hands. Interventions to improve hygiene in a healthcare environment can involve education for staff about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and written and oral reminders to staff.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most effective in different health environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective tool and is essential for achieving good health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in the home, at school and at work makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand-washing pipes close to each private and public toilets are extremely rare, although there are cheap options available to build hand-washing stations.
However, the low rate of hand washing can also be due to the embedded habit of lack of soap or water.
The promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavioral changes in the population.
For this to work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
A systematic review of 70 studies found an effective community-based approach to improving handwashing at LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. An example of a handwashing promotion at school is "Three Star Approaches" by UNICEP that encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other sanitary conditions.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one to finally three stars.
Developing a hand washing station can be part of a hand washing promotion campaign carried out to reduce childhood illness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that tries to change behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has promoted the use of handwashing emojis.
Several studies have considered the cost-effectiveness of hand washing thoroughly in developing countries in relation to DALY.
Yet one survey showed that promoting hand washing with soap was far more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who just gave birth to children or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Forence Nightingale, the English "modern nursing founder."
At that time most people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul smell called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections caused the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness about in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect yourself from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "right hand washing techniques" were hung next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in toilets of German office buildings and airports.
The phrase "washing one's hands off" something, means declaring one's reluctance to take responsibility for it or sharing involvement in it.
It comes from the Bible verse in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase with more widespread use in some English communities.
In Macbeth by Shakespreare, Lady Macbeth begins compulsively washing her hands in an attempt to wash away imagined stains, which represent her feelings of guilt regarding the crimes she has committed and which she has influenced for her husband to commit.
It is found that people, after remembering or reflecting back on unethical practices, tend to wash their hands more often than others and appreciate hand washing equipment more.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflections are less likely to engage in other payment "washing" actions, such as volunteering.
Religion prescribes hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolically, by using water without soap to wash hands, is part of the hand washing ritual found in many religions including Bahai, Hindu, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also prescribes clean hand washing especially after certain actions.
Hindus, Jews and Muslims are required to wash their hands after using the toilet.
Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews and Muslims are also required to wash their hands before and after eating.
Workplace hazard control against COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is an application for occupational health and safety methodology for hazard control to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper hazard control in the workplace depends on the job site and work tasks, based on risk assessments for the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of each employee who may be exposed to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with low risk of exposure have minimal job contact with the public and other co-workers, whose basic infection prevention measures are proposed include hand washing, encouraging employees to sit at home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and maintaining routine hygiene and disinfection at work.
Jobs with moderate exposure risk include jobs that require frequent or close contact with an unknown person or are suspected to have COVID-19, but may be infected due to an ongoing community transmission or international travel.
These include employees who have contact with the public such as at school, work environments with high population densities, and some retail environments with high volume.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures including ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneeze controllers, and having personal protective equipment in case of contact with people infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health care workers and mortuary homes exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if employees perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from people who are known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19.
Suitable hazard control for these employees includes engineering controls such as a ventilation room with negative pressure and personal protective equipment suitable for work tasks.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have a number of effects in the workplace.
Employees may not be present for work due to illness, need to take care of others or fear being exposed.
Trading patterns may change, both in terms of the goods requested, and how to get these items (such as shopping outside peak time or through a delivery or past-drive service).
Finally, the direct delivery of goods from geographic areas affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted. The preparedness and response plan of infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plan addresses the level of risk associated with various job sites and occupational tasks including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community environment, and risk factors of each employee such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the control necessary to address such risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the pandemic.
The preparedness plan and response to infectious diseases may be subject to the recommendation of a national or subnational plan.
Objectives for response to the pandemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at high risk for severe health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the business is located affects the responses taken.
Hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard control according to effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control, and the last is personal protective equipment.
Engineering control involves the isolation of employees from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in a work policy or procedure that requires the actions of an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected on the basis of hazard to the employee, properly installed in accordance with suitability (e.g. respirator), properly worn consistently, constantly inspected, maintained and replaced, if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal job contact with the public and other co-workers.
The recommended basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging employees to sit at home if they are sick, respiratory ethics include shutting down when coughing and sneezing, preparing tissues and garbage containers, preparing for a telework or work turn if necessary, not encouraging employees to use other people's tools or equipment, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfection at work.
The identification and rapid isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with acute respiratory symptoms sit at home until they are free of fever, fever or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing medications or other symptom-altering medications, and flexible sick leave policies, allowing employees to sit at home to care for sick family members, and employees to know about these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at risk of moderate exposure include jobs that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of an unknown or suspected COVID-19 patient, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to an ongoing community transmission around a business location, or because the individual has recently traveled internationally to locations with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes workers who have contact with the public such as at school, work environment with high population density and some high volume protective environments. Engineering control for these groups and higher-risk groups includes installing air filters with high efficiency, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as plastic sneeze protectors and installing past-drive windows for customer service, administrative control for these groups and higher-risk groups including encouraging sick workers to sit at home.
Employees in this risk group rarely require the use of respirators.
If a person falls ill on a plane, proper controls to protect other employees and passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew to take care of the sick person, and giving a face mask to the sick person or having the sick person cover his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crews should wear disposable medical gloves when treating sick travelers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and may be additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in biohazard bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, the hazard control includes delaying travel when sick, self-isolating and informing the medical center on board immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, follow-up medical action should be made in the cabin of an isolated person. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean up or disinfect if an infected person has been inside the school building regardless of the community spread.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education and choir classes or dining in cafeterias, adding space between tables, time of arrival and return stages, limiting non-essential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a high rate of transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, the extension of school termination can be considered. The CDC considers the overall health risk for law enforcement members who engage in routine activities is low.
Law enforcement officers who must make contact with individuals who are confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians including proper personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during arrest, employees should clean and disassemble their belts and duty equipment before re-using them with sprays or home cleaning wipes, and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and for the laying and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and mortuary homes to be in the high or very high category of exposure risk.
High-risk jobs exposed include delivery of health care, support, laboratories and medical transport workers exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
It poses a very high risk of exposure if employees perform aerosol production procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or the collection of invasive specimens.
High exposure risk mortuary employment includes employees involved in preparing the bodies of people known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; it becomes a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for this risk group include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when an aerosol production procedure is performed.
Ventilation with special negative pressure may be appropriate in some health care places and mortuary homes.
Specimens need to be controlled with Level 3 Biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends patients who will be in isolation to different waiting places depending on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of known, or suspected, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol production procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filter face respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including fit tests, exercises and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide higher protection and improve employee comfort. WHO does not recommend cover clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not spread through body fluids.
The WHO recommends only surgical masks for entrance examination personnel.
For those who collect respiratory specimens from, treat, or transport COVID-19 patients without an aerosol production procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, eye protections, or face protectors, protective suits and gloves.
If the aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
As global supply of PPE is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, by allowing only those involved in direct care to enter the room of COVID-19 patients, using only the PPE necessary for specific tasks, continuing the use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and not encouraging the use of individual masks.

PLEASE: CC0: No rights reserved
We found ourselves in a very unusual situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes our relationships in the world and the responsibilities we have toward each other clear.
We don't have challenges like this before, but we do know that our best response depends on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern that we have seen among all our colleagues through email, phone and chatter is an extraordinary confirmation of the extraordinary human being we are lucky enough to work together.
I am so grateful and proud to be your co-worker.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
This reminds me of how much the world means now when it can refer to Wikipedia, and how it has become a powerful symbol because this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Your work makes all of this possible, whether you keep your website active or your paid co-workers or our community safe.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, especially in the present moment.
It's a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Co-ordination to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next day and month.
In the discussion, we assumed what we thought would be a response to what we were dealing with and the best way to ensure this organization could survive at the moment.
Together, we want to eliminate stress and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to slow down a bit, that's okay.
To all staff, contractors and contract workers:
We expect our daily work to be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We don't announce holidays - if you can work at regular times, the mission can use you.
However, the world is now unpredictable. Whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buy kitchen items or see a doctor, your well-being is our top priority.
We're not going to record your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have been told, but we told it.
There's no need for sick days or PTOs - just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to ensure key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please inform Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure that your situation gets due attention from the management).
Those who are paid by the hour will be paid in full.
We have informed and reaffirmed our commitment to honor the commitments of our contractors and staff colleagues who are paid by the hour.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be so satisfying to us, especially in times like these.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We only ask that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt accordingly.
Some work is considered important.
There are some things we need to keep going.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Security, and Fundraising teams (among other things) perform critical work that may require additional assistance.
We will begin the process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is important to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now won't harm then.
We don't plan to move "twice to chase what's left behind" as soon as the pandemic passes.
You are not expected to work overtime to meet a deadline that is now unrealistic.
We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and will strive to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What happened to the APP (Yearly Plan)?
To adapt to the reality and expectations of our daily working hours, we want to adjust the delivery timeline of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to recommend an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for budgets to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and the care of their loved ones while helping those who need or want to work with reduced work periods for the next few weeks.
The extension of the timeline greatly reduces the workload and stress of the current plan throughout the organization.
We will introduce our proposal to the Board next week and will inform our representatives and team about the next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office status, disclosure and cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our SF colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we have hired an antivirus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect every surface as well as the lobby and elevator systems that reach our level.
The building adopts its own care task protocol in using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We felt comfortable that the office would be well available when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which shares the COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members based in DC.
As of last week, our DC office is turning to a fully-fledged remote setup in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based co-workers know, we're also talking about one-time location leasing in Brooklyn.
This discussion continues, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues worked remotely for the first time.
Our long-time co-workers know that it can be an adaptation and want to give you some advice:
Limit the meeting duration to an additional one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it for a few days.
Establish a clear meeting, have an agenda and send the reading material in advance.
Create the default video, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Having a leader to handle each meeting, one to monitor the conversation for questions and keep track of the list of speakers, and one helps to take notes (or do note taking collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headphone.
Use your welfare reimbursement for snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in Slack to chat with your co-workers about distributed tasks
The HR Operations Team is looking at ergonomic webinar guides to support improvements in tasks distributed throughout the Foundation.
Over the past few weeks we have asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editaton until the WHO announces an end to the pandemic.
We tell them that we understand our requests for cancellations and other restrictions may be impossible in completing their agreed grant activities and that nothing will be prosecuted for delaying or modifying those goals.
In the coming week we will make a follow-up with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiment of the entire global community seems to be sadness at the disruption but is relieved at the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and vice versa.
Going forward, CRT strives to develop a single page about Meta-Wiki to provide space for communities to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Stay in touch on COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and take some time to connect with each other.
We are here to help as much as we can.
For now, you can continue to search for information from this email, and all other important COVID-19-related information on Office Wiki.
The CRT will ensure that all these pages are updated and all the information is in one place.
We also strive to ensure regular communication with staff who are in a country that is very impressed at the moment.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, or coverage challenges, or whatever help you need, don't hesitate to inform and collaborate with CRT.
We are here to assist in providing support and be a liaison if needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive matters, please email Bryan Judan - HR International Global Operations Director.
None of these changes should be seen as a waiver of our work and responsibilities.
However, all of this is recognition at the moment, our work and responsibilities are likely to need to be adjusted in a way that is unlike the past.
These are the steps we believe as necessary to support each other so that we can continue working, providing our movements with the support they need, and the services the world can expect of them.
Our goal is to be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for important tasks to come in the weeks and possibly months to come.
We need you all to make it a reality, and we need you all to take care of yourself and your family so that you will be ready at the best level when that need arrives.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme connected to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 faces the activity of angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) associated with reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a drug that can be expected to be targeted to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry center into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelium and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal M2 peptidase domain and the C-terminal collection renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-way type 1 membrane protein, with its enzyme domain actively exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer domain of ACE2 cells is attached to the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the results of the dissolved protein are released into the bloodstream and eventually condensed into urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is twinned on the cell membrane of most alveolus type II cells of the lungs, small intestine entrocytes, arteries and venous endothelium cells and soft muscle cells of the arteries in most organs.
The expression of mRNA ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE attaches the hormone I angiotensin into the narrowing of vaso angiotensin II.
ACE2 instead adheres to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and its hydrolysis into angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also attach a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]- bradicin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the distribution of the neutral amino acid transporter membrane SLC6A19 and is indicated in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as a major entry center into cells for some coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, binding to the spike S1 protein for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 on the domain is enzymeed at ACE2 over the surface of the cell resulting in endocytosis and the translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosome is located between the cells.
The admission process also requires the incorporation of S protein by the serine protease host TMPRSS2, an inhibitor under current studies as a potential therapeutic. This has led some to hypothesize that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help in fighting infection.
However, various professional associations and regulatory bodies recommend continuing ACE standard inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a large 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared with control."
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia is also reduced for patients treated with ACE inhibitors who have a higher risk for pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been linked to a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality rates, although the results are less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombination of human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to increase pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with the acute respiratory distress syndrome of the affected lipopolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the start of the action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour effect action.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 can be a drug that can be expected for those with intolerances in classic renin angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases surrounding enhanced angiotensin II. rhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical studies for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software application designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may be in contact with infected individuals.
Many applications are developed or proposed with government officials supporting in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building relationship tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy concerns are raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of user applications.
Less disruptive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proxy log on another cell phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has launched an application that allows citizens to check if they have ever had contact with those infected with COVID-19.
It is used in all over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, launched as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", an application based on Bluetooth to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide quick feedback to health care authorities.
Applications are developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking app is at an advanced stage of development, and will be available for launch in a few weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether Singapore app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geolimit applications for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and a potential lack of effectiveness if application implementation is limited to only a fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or dangerous "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits for the type of organization that can add coronavirus-related apps to its Apps Store, limiting them to only "powerful" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented the same restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed concerns about the impact of mass surveillance using the coronavirus app, in particular about whether surveillance infrastructure was created to address the coronavirus pandemic would be stopped as soon as the threat passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for a limit on such surveillance.
The organization declared eight conditions on government projects:
(a) the supervision shall be "lawful, if necessary and proportionate";
The monitoring and monitoring should have an embedded clause;
the use of data should be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
data security and anonymity shall be protected and shown as evidence-based protection;
Digital surveillance should avoid worsening discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
be protected against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
meaningful engagement by all "relevant stakeholders" should be required, including public health experts and marginalized groups. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issue checklists.
Google/Apple's proposed plan aims to address ongoing surveillance issues by removing tracking mechanisms from their device's operating system once they are no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking rather than apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have huge potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with centralized servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy preservation systems are already created that use centralized servers only for mutual communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to perform relationship tracking.
Instead of using specialized applications, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and this merger generates notices through text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, something that is allowed due to major changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries including Germany consider using a centralized system and privacy preservation.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been published.
Tracking relationships with privacy preservation is a concept organized with important body study literature starting from 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working for privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log consumer proximities on other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, and not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes the Decentralized Privacy Maintenance Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, Event Number Contact fka, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocol and Mechanism for Other Mobile Relationships.
In this protocol, the identified personal data never leaves the device, and all matching takes place on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or data of a cross section of course to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar venture is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technology that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive locations and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by several groups united on the same important methods and large overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global operationalization for tracking applications and alerters, an important aspect of achieving widespread use.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had already made open source for the BlueTrace protocol used by official government applications.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for relationship tracking that they claim will preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-preservation cryptography.
They also publish specifications of core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system intends to be launched in three stages:
The launch of tools to enable the government to create a privacy-preservation coronavirus tracking app
The integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android plans of Google and Apple to address ongoing implementation and surveillance problems by first distributing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way as soon as the threat passes.
Repositioning the drug (also known as changing the purpose of the drug, re-profiling, reassignment or therapeutic conversion) is changing the purpose of an approved drug for the treatment of different diseases or health conditions from the reason it was originally developed.
This is an ongoing scientific research effort to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research directions include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of recovery plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 medicated proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analyzing the binding site provides an affordable project to develop effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are proteases such as papain, RNA-dependent polymerases, helicases, S proteins and ADP ribophosphates.

A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no advantages can be observed".
The drug is designed to inhibit HIV from mimicking by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a compound that will bind to the protease SARS-CoV-2. There has been criticism in the scientific community about redirecting resources to change the purpose of the drug developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity experiment.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences went on to discover that Remdesivir has in vitro antiviral activity against various filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronavirus-viruses.
One issue with antiviral treatment is the detection of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe diseases and transplants.
Some early pretrial studies suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several clinical trials being implemented including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and another for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials under way for intravenous vitamin C for those hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19, two controlled placebos (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there have been many attempts in progress to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available for less than 18 months.
Five candidates for the vaccine were in the Phase 1 safety study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The global outbreak of the major pandemic in 2020, providing proportional investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations are using genomes published to develop a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
Declared in April, the imperative of the CEPI initiative for the development of accelerated vaccines, manufacturing capacity, scaled implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platforms aiming to progress into Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Development of Phase 1 and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (Development of Phase I and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologics, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered as in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials carry out early safety and immunogenicity tests, usually at random, placebo-controlled and multi-site, while determining effective dosages more accurately.
Level III trials typically involve more participation including control groups and the effectiveness of tests on vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 are still under "preclinical" research.
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune response.

In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled resources for supercomputer access from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits other than preventable diseases.
A randomised trial in Australia aims to register 4,170 healthcare workers.
There is a possibility that vaccines in development are not safe or effective.
Preliminary research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, showed the need for bio-level 3 safety restraint measures to handle live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no antidote or protective vaccine for SARS that has been proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. In addition, there is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS is widespread, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that has completed phase I of clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are virus vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Broadcasts on social media promoted conspiracy theories claiming the virus behind COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually five days but may start between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 patients have recovered. The virus in particular spreads between humans during close contact, often through small drops produced through coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these drops are produced during exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or on the surface rather than become infections for long distances.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for up to 72 hours.
Most infectious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and in the next stage of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by reaction of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (cRT-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended to those who suspect themselves to be carrying the virus and their caregivers.
The recommendations for the use of masks by ordinary people differ, with some authorities recommending not using them, some recommending their use and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or virus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease is recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or exhibit flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Symptoms of anxiety include difficulty breathing, pain or constant chest pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and face or bluish lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear.
Less commonly, upper respiratory spasms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are observed in multiple percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only data congestion and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may be between two to 14 days.
97.5% of patients who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected show symptoms.
The role of this asymptomatic carrier in transplantation is still not fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that it may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of those infected shows no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KDCC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission started to include asymptomatic cases in their daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Kahak and saliva can carry a lot of viral load.
Strong speech releases more drips than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that a cough that does not close the mouth can cause drops to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not innate, the National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transfers are likely and air collectors at positions in passageways outside the public room show positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause secretion of respiration into aerosols and subsequently cause congenital spread.
Despite concerns it spreads through stool, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is highly contagious when people are asymptomatic; although the spread is possible before the appearance of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says although the whole is unclear about how easily the disease spreads, a person infects two to three people in general. The virus persists for several hours to several days on the surface.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable for a day over cardboard, up to three days over plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours over 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products weaken the protective layer of viral fat, disabling them and freeing them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant) were less effective. In one Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken for the median for two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the novel characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occur naturally in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which leaks its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is almost related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 as the virus accesses the host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), the most abundant in type II alveolous cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface of glycoproteins called "pumpers" (plomers) to connect at ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute Cardium Injury was found in 12% of infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China and more often in severe illness.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system diseases during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are very numerous in the heart and are involved in heart function.
High incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) are found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be related to a weak prognosis. Autopsies of those who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolus damage (DAD), and lymphocyte invasions contain inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for epithelial cells of ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
In particular, T cells secrete pathogenic GM-CSF is shown to correlate with the inflammatory intake of monocytic secretions IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic invasion is also reported during autopsy.
WHO publishes several testing protocols for disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rPT-PCR).
Tests are usually performed on a respiratory sample obtained with a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or phlegm sample may also be used.
The results are generally available in a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate coronavirus strains and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infections by viruses.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (possibly detecting an active infection and whether a person has ever been infected in the past) are under development but are not widely used.
China's experience with testing has shown accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first initial test of care on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of the month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for infection detection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
The opacity of glass shattered bilateral multilobar with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution is common during early infection.
Dominant subpleuras, multiple layers (inflammation of the septum bubbles with multiple alveolus fillings) and unification may appear as the disease progresses.
Some data can be found on the monoscopic and pathophysiological lesions of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during an autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung unification and pulmonary edema
Four types of severeness for viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytes, hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, space-intermediate inflammation with lymphocytic invasion and multinuclear giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolus damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolus exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
restoring pneumonia: the preparation of exudate in alveolus cavities and pulmonary space-between fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulantization (DIC), leukoeritroblastic reticulation
Preventive measures to reduce the chance of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, washing hands frequently with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the shoulder in the absence of tissue.
Proper hand hygiene after any coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public places, in part to limit transfers by asymptomatic individuals. The social distancing strategy aims to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups through school and workplace closures, limit travel and cancel large public gatherings.
The jailing guidelines also include for people to be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from each other.
There are no drugs identified as effective for preventing COVID-19. Since vaccines are not expected until at least early 2021, the main thing in managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "placing curves".
The CDC also recommends that individuals regularly wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands look dirty, before eating or after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
Again it is recommended to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol but only when soap and water are not provided. For areas that do not have commercial hand sanitizer, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help get rid of bacterial spores in alcohol; it "is not an active ingredient for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that anyone who suspects they carry the virus to wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its advantages are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful for those with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the China Health Commission have published a recommendation to take care of those hospitalized with COVID-19.
Critical care experts and pulmonologists in the U.S. collect treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Caution should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when implementing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals taking care of those infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Innate Infectious Isolation Room (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and innate precautions. The CDC provides guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE dress, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirator (compared to face mask) is preferred.
The N95 respirator is approved by industry settings but the FDA already allows masks to be used under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It is designed to protect against innate particles such as dust but is effective against specialized biological agents not guaranteed for off-label use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or as a final option, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some percentages require it.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related to respiratory failure is being actively studied for patients in hospitals with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or two-stage positive airway pressure.
Whether these two provide the same benefits to people who are critically ill is unknown.
Some doctors choose to remain with invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannulas. Severe cases are usually frequent in older adults (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of the health system to handle a sharp increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% of those admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support of ventilators and 1.4% died.
In China, at least 30% of patients in hospitals with COVID-19 will eventually be admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators are capable of controlling high pressure and PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of ventilator-related lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on ventilators for longer.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020, and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears to be the most reliable.
While new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs may be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends volunteers take part in potential treatment effectiveness and safety trials. The FDA provides temporary permission for plasma recovery as an experimental treatment in case for their lives that are serious or vulnerable.
It has not yet gone through the necessary clinical studies to show it is safe and effective for disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID.
The app can detect 'close contact' using surveillance data and thus the risk of potential infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also warns local health authorities. Big data analysis of cellular phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people they connect with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track their mobile phone data with coronavirus.
Measures are being taken to enforce quarantine and protect those in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia is implementing facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italian provincial health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people continue to move around".
The German government runs a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid called on the global for creative solutions to the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, the effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession is the perfect thousand that endanger people's mental health and well-being."
The disease will cause mild effects with little or no symptoms, resembling a common upper respiratory disease such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually resolve within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness take three or six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may be at high risk of getting severe COVID-19 infection based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is lacking. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs that cause pneumonia.
In most of those severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly become acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.
Complications related to COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Abnormal freezing, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, has been evident in as many as 6% of those admitted to hospitals with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function was observed in 4% of this group.
At least 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent for hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In the initial case study, the median time from the early symptom indication to death was 14 days, with full coverage of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8% while women with a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of post-mortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolus damage with exudate cellular fibromisoid in both lungs.
Changes in viral cytopathy are observed in pneumocytes.
A picture of the lungs shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was observed with elevated levels of troponin or cardium stalled.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those admitted to hospitals with pre-existing health conditions, the availability of regional medical and socioeconomic resources may also have an impact on mortality rates.
Estimates of mortality rates from the circumstances differ due to their territorial differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
A lower count of mild cases can lead to overestimation for the death rate.
However, the fact that death is due to cases of infection in the past can mean the current mortality rate is overestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have at least 2.4 times more likely to need care or die than nonsmokers. Concerns have been voiced about the long-term follow-up of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some patients recovering from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.
This may also lead to the syndrome after intensive care following recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not known if previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity in those recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible, based on other coronavirus behaviors, but in cases with recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by a positive test for coronavirus at a previously reported date.
All of these cases are believed to be worse with prolonged infection than re-infection.
Viruses are considered natural and come from animals, through an abundance of infections.
The exact origin is unknown but as of December 2019 the transmission of the infection as a whole was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest start date of symptoms was on December 1, 2019.
Official publication from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
A few steps are usually used to measure the mortality rate.
These figures vary by region and by time and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the period since early transmission and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO instituted the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-certified SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection without clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed laboratory confirmation. The mortality-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University's statistics, the global mortality-to-case ratio was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The amount varies by region. Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed to die from the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of individuals infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics are not subject to time and adhere to a particular population from infection to case resolution.
While not everyone develops antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about the number of people infected.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) has died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread by Carnival parties, and transmission to younger people, causing lower mortality rates in comparison, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system is not overstated.
In the Netherlands, at least 3% may have antibodies as assessed from blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for both men and women.
Higher mortality rates for men in the study were implemented in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is those in their 50s, with the gap between men and women reaching only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for these sex differences are unknown but genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.
Immunological differences based on sex, lack of prevalence of smoking in women and men forming joint morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women may be able to contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals are men and 72% of the total deaths due to COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked sex-related data for COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that blues diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on both men and women.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and they have a higher exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that the abbreviation CO for coronavirus, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for the time of the outbreak were identified for the first time: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, in accordance with international recommendations for naming purposes to avoid stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO additionally uses the "COVID-19 virus" and the "virus responsible for COVID-19) in public communication.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases are commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and acute respiration disease 2019-nCoV as temporary names for viruses and diseases in line with the 2015 guidance on location use for diseases and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers manufacture health care materials such as nose swabs and ventilators parts.
In one instance, when Italian hospitals urgently require ventilator valves, and suppliers can't ship them in the required timescale, a local engineering novice turns around and produces the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial transmission of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and incorrect information emerged regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread online quickly.
Humans are able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral mimicry in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being undertaken by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization began a "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the treatment effects of four current antiviral compounds with the most reliable effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous efforts on SARS-CoV are being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three strategies under investigation.
First, the researchers aim to build a vaccine for the virus as a whole.
The use of the virus, whether inactive or dying, is aimed at obtaining immediate immune response to the human body against a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that is sensitive to the immune system in some subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focused on the S nail protein that helps the virus invade the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is a nuclear acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies need to be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic codes copied from disease-causing viruses. Increased antibody dependence is proposed as a potential challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials being conducted as of April 2020.
Seven trials were already approved as a treatment for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The purpose-altered antiviral drug covers most of China's research, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir for several countries to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates is available, as of April 2020. Several current antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir are joined by beta interferon.
There is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials were conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, used to treat malaria was previously studied in China in February 2020, giving preliminary results.
However, there is a call for a review of the research equivalent.
The Korean and Chinese authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, admits that doubling the dose is very dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published the emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of medical experts treating those infected with COVID-19. China's 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for advanced in vivo studies after showing low-concentration inhibition on SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early-enhancement protein buoyancy by serine protease transmembrane 2 (TMPRSS2) is important for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine together or without azithromycin has major limitations that prevent the medical community from using this therapy without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storms can be a complication in the next stage for severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine has anticytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
It is currently undergoing a non-random phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results with severe illness.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, this means to counteract those developments, which are thought to be the cause of death for some infected people.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-induced refractory cytokine release syndrome by different causes, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by their immune system cured from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccination method for passive immunization.
This strategy was tested on SARS with no conclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a mechanism of action in which passive antibody therapy can serve as a defense mediator against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cellular cytotoxicity of possible antibody dependence and/or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using the resulting monoclonal antibodies are under development.
Rehabilitation serum production, which consists of a liquid part of the blood from the recovered patient and contains specific antibodies to the virus can be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, was later infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
