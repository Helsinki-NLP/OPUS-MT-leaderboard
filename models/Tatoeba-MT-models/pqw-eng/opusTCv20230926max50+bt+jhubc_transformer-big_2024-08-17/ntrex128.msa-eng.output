Congressman (AM) Wales worried about "looking like a doll"
There is concern among some AMs over the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Members of Parliament of Wales).
It came about because of plans to change the name of the conference to the Parliament of Wales.
I'm worried that the entire political spectrum may be causing confusion.
An AM from the Labour Party said his party cared ‘he rhymed with ‘Twp' and ‘Pwp'.'
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, ‘twp' means ‘crazy' and ‘pwp' means ‘unclean.'
AM from Plaid said his party as a whole was "not happy" and had proposed an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was ‘open-minded' about the name change, but stated it was a brief oral leap from the MWP to the Dolls.
In this context, the letter ‘w’ in Welsh is referred to as the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter ‘u.’
The Council Commission, which is drafting legislation to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision on any so-called Councillor must be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the council of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission notified the results of public consultations on proposals that had wide support to call the council the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the AM title, the Commission favored Members of Parliament of Wales or WMP, but the choice of MWP received the most support in public consultations.
AM appears to be proposing alternative options, but it is problematic to reach an agreement and could be discouraging the chief Honorary Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within weeks.
The law on reform includes other changes in the way the council works, including regulations on the loss of AM qualifications and the design of the committee system.
AM will get a final vote on what questions to mention when they debate the law.
Macedonia votes in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to either change their country’s name to the ‘Northern Republic of Macedonia.’
The popular vote was established in an effort to resolve decades of dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly denied its membership offers for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was only a price to pay to join the EU and NATO union.
St. Martin's bells are silent as churches are struggling in Harlem
"The parents I met said, historically, there were bars and churches on every street corner," Adams said.
"They're both gone now."
He said the loss of the bar was understandable.
"People are socializing in a different way now," he said.
"Bar is no longer a living room in a neighborhood where people will always go."
As for the church, he feared the money from the sale of assets would not last as long as the leader expected it, "and sooner or later they would return where they started."
Churches, he said, could be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums inhabited by people who do not want to help maintain the remaining sanctuaries in the neighbourhood.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in this building are white," he said, "and therefore will have these churches closed altogether because it is unlikely that most people who enter these condominiums will be members of the churches."
Both churches were built by whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist church moved in the 1930s.
The black church that had been worshipping nearby took ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by blacks under the Honourable John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which opposed hiring or promoting blacks in employment.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Pastor Johnson made plans to rebuild it, they ordered a tower bell.
David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin, proudly referred to the tower's bells as ‘the bells of the poor.'
Experts who played the carillon in July called it something else: ‘Cultural khazana’ and ‘irreplaceable historical instruments.'
Experts, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been played at St Martin's over the past few months has become a hassle to architects and contractors, some brought in by church leaders, others by Episcopal bishops.
The Vestry Room - the governing body of the congregation, consisting of public leaders - wrote the bishop in July with concern the bishop "will seek to approve the costs" for the vestry chamber, although the vestry chamber was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors brought in by the bishop.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy while diving in search of coral shrimp in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving in search of a coral shrimp in California on the opening day of the coral shrimp season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing along with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a fun scream of catching a crayfish, but he "realized that the boy was screaming, "I have to bite!
I've got to bite!"
His entire collarbone has been torn and exposed," Hammel said he noticed when he got the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's sharks in the water!'" added Hammel.
The child was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that sharks had been found in the area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed to be a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams from a beauty-style space in a department store controlled by an expert assistant.
As part of the hard work of entering the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow while fashion and home appliances sales return, the larger beauty space will be tested in 11 stores nationwide and taken to more stores next year if it results in success.
Investment in beauty comes as supermarkets look for ways to use the previously claimed shelf space for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its beauty offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
An existing range of products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the same branded parts as those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching a range of Boutique make-up products to make the majority of their products vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly in demand by shoppers from young people.
Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's supermarkets, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London, last week while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and moving towards buying a little food every day at a local convenience store means the supermarket has to work hard again to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the branch would look like a convenience store as the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl's big business with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's put Argos branches in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several places since it bought both chains two years ago, said to have increased retail sales and made the turnover more profitable.
The past supermarkets wanted to modify the beauty and pharmaceutical parts that ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boot in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a disagreement over how to split revenues from pharmaceutical stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacy store businesses to Celestio, owner of Lloyds' Pharmaceuticals chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds played a role in the show, adding various luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've changed the look and appearance in our beauty space to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest with specially trained friends to be willing to offer advice.
Our wide range of brands are designed to cater to every need, and the attractive environment and comfortable location mean we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'beaver' after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11 million offer
Peter Jones, Dragons' Den star, 'beaver' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for home goods and accessories from the Truly Brand.
The couple's business was likened to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The This Morning presenter, 37, used Instagram to announce that he would quit.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones, in a fit of anger by pulling out of the lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her new extraordinary contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was “a beaver” when the TV woman admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — meant she had no time to devote home goods and accessories from the True brand.
The business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "For a long time, Holly has been a priority.
It will be his long-term future that will see him through the next few decades.
The decision to pull out everyone involved was truly surprising.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it's so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff at Marlow's headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of the presenter This Morning, which is one of the most acceptable stars in a bank in Britain, could cost firms millions due to a huge investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and home goods, and potentially delaying its launch.
It could be the end of that friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children and husband Dan Baldwin has been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby formed Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones had a 40% stake in Baldwin, a TV publishing firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's attorney in the I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business dealings."
"We're in love and then we're in love"
He joked about the criticism that the news media would receive for making comments that would partly consider ‘unfair to the president’ and very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said by appealing to a ‘newsreader’ vote.
“I never give up on losing.”
He said Kim was interested in the second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June had been crowned by Trump as a major step towards halting North Korea's nuclear program.
But negotiations on the cessation of the nuclear program have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "similar answer" from the United States about North Korea's early gun-surge.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continued sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Our relationship with North Korea is good," he said.
"We will go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free the hostages, and bringing the bodies of American soldiers back to their homeland.
And he defends his extraordinary approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing at the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Islands, Kill Hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations said they were not needed.
While more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been evacuated, no national disaster has been declared, as a condition to ensure international aid.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they clearly don't ask for international help, so it's quite challenging," Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children together in a team goes to Palu, it is uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the scene.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Based on the earth tremors that Indonesia often faces, the country remains unprepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other beaches.
The lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although warnings have come into force, it is like contributing to the loss of life.
At best, travel between islands in Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat victims of the quake was heading to Palu, but it took at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made severe infrastructure improvements a key point in his election campaign, and he has given high allocations to roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has plagued Jokowi's administration as he faces a re-election next year.
Jokowi is facing pressure from religious tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have received a more conservative religious understanding.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge equalises against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring one goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal with his side leading 1-0.
He kicked the ball to the left before kicking towards a distant goal net.
The attempt soared high above the goal goal as he floated towards the top right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball fell on top of Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always carry the ball as far as possible, so I try to spend as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and make a shot and don't think long and then take a shot at it."
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after scoring in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before hovering in the middle of the pitch and running into the central part of Liverpool.
Kovacic gives and sends can be quickly in the middle.
He then let go of a beautiful kick, bringing Hazard into goal.
Danger passed the defence and scored a distant goal with a left-footed kick past Liverpool player Alisson Becke.
Liverpool play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reportedly trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck Friday and triggered a 20-foot wave, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, is filled with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation was carried out after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with a stabbing impact at Grayson Mews in John Street, with the 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to see or hear anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still at an early stage but I appeal to anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard camera futej to contact us as they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found was a local Birkenhead and she was found inside her home.
In the evening, friends who believed they knew the woman had arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police said the investigation was under way, they were in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to get into his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was shocked when he found out what was going on.
Residents were told the investigation took hours until they were allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He kept repeating "it's so terrible."
At 2pm, two police vans were inside the cordon and another van outside.
Several officers standing inside the cordon monitored the apartment block of the apartment.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 citing log 247 from 30 September.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament to be the latest memorial to be hit by 'rewriting history'
His removal would be a poetic justice for destruction like his Taliban with so much of England's artifact culture and religion perpetrated by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as ‘stupid' and ‘trying to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues for which the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be targeted.
Iconoclasm from the English civil war was either not directed or run by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed because of the actions of Thomas' ancestors in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful representation of Cromwell is a 19th-century testament and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, more by the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in his situation of course a monarchy.
Whether it is a full representation becomes the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped our country's subsequent development, and Cromwell is an individual known as a figure representing a divided division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also to be celebrated and commemorated."
Pigs Beat Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs at a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery, filled with blood near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have travelled with his cousin from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day, his cousin finds him dead, and finds a pig door next door open.
He said in a pig cage was a large male pig with his mouth bleeding.
A forensic examination confirmed that a 550-pound pig had been biting farmers to death, according to the report.
"His family," Wu said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the store at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig had been locked to prevent him from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After Oregon farmers were eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not always aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "pecker."
They're just messing around.
They're nippers, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to pay the right amount of respect," he said.
More hurricane Rosa brings extensive heavy rains to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves into the cool waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rain in northern Mexico and the southwest of the U.S. the next day.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, until 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough that began forming in the Pacific Ocean and moved east toward the U.S. West Coast When Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it began to reject the tropics northward southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity interacts with the approaching trough which creates heavy rains in the Southwest the following day.
Within the country, 1 to 4 inches of rain would cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and landslides likely in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially more than Arizona.
Flash floods may be in severe condition due to the distribution of tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to venture into the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause canyons for raging rivers and thunderstorms that will bring the country strong winds and dust to blow.
The approaching trough will bring heavy rain on the Southern California coast.
The amount of rain more than half an inch is possible, which can lead to the flow of small debris and slippery roads.
This was the first rain in the region during the dry season.
Several tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become further late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and lastly on Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes can be seen across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain relatively warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes with short-range temperatures.
There's a great example of temperature differences through the U.S. center on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the warmth of the lingering summer will try to build and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to witness a warm start to October with the 80s extending from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which estimates 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecasts show a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people witnessed the shocking testimony on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of being sexually assaulted in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute touch: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was groping at him and trying to undress him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his testimony, said 100 per cent certainly did not happen.
It was probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
The company counts the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers are not immediately available for other networks showing PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Networks.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching in the office.
To put it in perspective, it's the size of a spectator equal to a football game or Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, which thinks the host has backed Kavanaugh's appointment, leads all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers while listening all day, Nielsen said.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The benefits remain high after listening.
Flake is the main character in the drama this Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested as a CNN and CBS camera on Friday morning was screamed at by protesters as he tried to board an elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes in dismay for a few minutes while he was preaching, live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"You think he's telling the truth?"
She was told, "You have power when many women don't have power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, he would have said a lot at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered the hours directly later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would see charges against nominees next week, the minority democrats urged.
Flake is confident of part of the conversation with his friend, Democrat Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation between Coons and several senators after that, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice does have power, as it is clear Republicans will not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his so-called Checkers' strike for Brexit, saying Britain's and the EU's proposals should gather their respective tariffs "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooter: Police detain suspect Dyteon Simpson with death of LSU player
Police have arrested the suspect in shooting dead Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed in prison on two-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted Wayde shot dead physically.
His bond has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner's office issued a report early Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department credited the Louisiana State Police's policing task force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police and the area's citizens in assisting with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for "persistence and justice efforts".
Sims is 20 years old.
6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
Dust spews from the volcano Popocatepetl to the southern region of the capital Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from volcanoes after activity increased in the crater and it registered 183 emissions of gas and dust for 24 hours.
The center monitors a variety of tremors and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of car windshields covered with ash in residential areas in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at a volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan sensitivities ahead of independence anniversary vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands took part in demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarisation of secession.
A group of masked pro-separators held by riot police pelted them with eggs and released paint powder, setting a dark cloud on the streets that tourists used to come to.
The fight also took place later with the police using their sticks to fight.
Hours later pro-independence groups chanted "Not forgetting, no forgiveness" in the face of unionist protesters shouting, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remained high in the independence region a year after the October 1 vote was deemed illegal by Madrid but welcomed by Catalans secessionists.
Voters chose to be independent, although the outgoing percentage of voting was low with those opposed to segregation largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop elections taking place at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the country's police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer expected the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year we went through one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
While management is crucial if it comes close to victory in regional elections in December, the Catalan pro-independence party has struggled to maintain momentum this year with their many well-known leaders either in exile or in custody to wait for a trial for their role in organizing referendums and declarations of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests against police support on her phone, said the conflict had been voiced by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before a trial since the end of last year, announced he would contest the European Parliament election next year.
"Contesting as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the repression we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after being hit by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the same car rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the door and the building itself.
A crossbar may have also opened fire on the car at some point.
Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston wins
Livingston's rise surprised Rangers to hand Steven Gerrard to a second defeat in 18 matches as Ibrox's club manager.
Dolly Menga's attack proved to be different when Gary Holt's team moved in with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face the Hearts chief, who they will trail with eight points next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended the unbeaten run in this division to six matches, with head coach Holt still feeling the defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a chance against the opposition.
Holt's side were supposed to be far ahead before scoring, with their involvement causing Rangers to face any problems.
Scott Robinson broke it but gave up his effort past the goal, but Alan Lithgow was only able to give up his effort after slipping to Craig Halkett's header.
The hosts were eager to let the Rangers play in front of them, realizing they could give the opposing side trouble with a set cut.
And that's the way in which important goals exist.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston opened the curtain, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set Menga, who took a touch and a goal from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had taken possession but had found a home defence that couldn't penetrate and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely no problem.
The pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced the rescue of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scored from another Livingston match.
Crosses went straight into Livingston's box and kept clearing, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for the handball - bounced away.
'Phenomena' of Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
For men, they are very brilliant, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since returning to the top level, but great credit has had to go to Holt for him to launch the team since he came.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was extremely brave, manifesting an orderly great defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all over the toes.
The Rangers are less inspirational, though.
Good as they are sometimes under Gerrard, they fall far from that standard.
The latter ball was somewhat lacking - only once they cut the home team - and it was a call for the Rangers to wake up, who found themselves in the middle table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a wide reception in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They spoke on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's participation in the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters nearby wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The war protests described the happiness of a visitor who was hailed as a hero by some Turks and fired as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: Bicycle rider dies in collision with car
The cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The incident came months after another cyclist died in a run-off on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his heirs.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disturbance
Six prison officials were injured in a disturbance in a high-security men's prison, the Prison Office said.
The disturbance occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at approximately 9:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Expert Officer "Tornado" was brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involved eight occupants and had one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Trained prison staff have been tasked with dealing with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and obviously they are responsible for referring to the police and can spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor was receiving hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officials were called to jail to deal with serious disturbances in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flash Floods
It's rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what might happen next week when Hurricane Rosa's wind power track crosses the Southwest Desert, a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for Arizona west to south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the route over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late yesterday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical tornadoes remain hurricanes or depressive status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 2 to 4 inches of rain fall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the Southwest Desert including the center of the Rockies and the Great Basin will probably get 1 to 2 inches, with a remote amount of up to perhaps 4 inches.
For those at risk of flash flooding, Rosa rain may have been a blessing since the region was hit by drought.
While flooding is a serious concern, there are some that rain will benefit since the Southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona experienced its worst drought, the second-highest category, "reported by weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm faces cold waters in the Pacific and therefore generates a descent.
As such, it is expected that the soil collapses in Mexico at the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico can be heavy, leading to the risk of major flooding.
"The amount of rainfall is expected from Baja California to Sonora northwest, so it may be 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will be tracking north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then detecting through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main hazards expected from Rosa or debris are very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest deserts," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rains are expected to produce life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested yesterday in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset areas, police said.
Officers appealed to those who might have a cell phone recording of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffering, meaningless, angry' Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote is a vote to reject the cruel and outrageous tactics in the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "severely suffered, furiously" the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, firmly and emotionally denying allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted during the decade during a teenage ruse.
Ford also testified to the hearing about his allegations.
The president said on Saturday "the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds at the moment, a lawman with an outstanding record in the public service," he told the public in support of West Virginia.
The president simultaneously refers to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of Republican elections in elections.
"Five more weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn’t run, but I actually ran,” he said.
"That's why I'm in a place that's fighting for a great candidate."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "oppose and deter."
The first major procedure vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, the GOP's senior aide leadership has told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake, tsunami, with tolls rising
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves crashing on the coast, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) hit land at dusk, sweeping away many deaths and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach and not running and eventually they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster arrest agency BNPB, said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it attacked everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the edge.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and were safe, he said.
About 16,700 people have been moved to 24 centres in Paluu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisting and collapsing and a mosque surrounded by water.
The final shock continued to shake the city by the beach on Saturday.
Several aftershocks were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Study and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami wave, the agency said.
Nugroho described the destruction as “widespread” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building and said another 540 people were injured and 29 people were still missing.
Nugroho said the death and destruction may have been more devastating along a coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala. It was close to the epicenter.
"Communication was completely cut off without any information from Donggala," Nugroho said.
"About 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were heading to the affected area.
"This is a tragedy, but it can get even worse," the Red Cross said.
The agency was heavily criticised on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had struck Palu despite officials saying that the tsunami occurred during the warning period.
In an amateur video that went viral on social media, a man's voice over the building shouted at the crowd on the street about the presence of a tsunami.
Within minutes, a tsunami wave stormed the coast and pulled along with the buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a massive power leak that cut off communications around Palu and this made it difficult for authorities to carry out search efforts.
The military has sent aid with cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities but displaced people still need food and other basic necessities, authorities said.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the transfer centre in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 800.
It's so bad.
While the World Vision Staff from Donggala had safely arrived in Palu city, they went through the scene of the disaster. Workers took shelter under tarpal cloth set up in the front yard of their office in Palu, said Mr Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While relief teams began to provide disaster relief in a bleak atmosphere, some said foreign aid workers with deep experience were prevented from heading to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supply of materials and delivery of workers from abroad can only be carried out if the disaster area is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross Force.
"When the government says "OK, this is a national disaster," then we can receive help from abroad but for now there is no status anymore."
As the second night approaches in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing victims hope that their loved ones become a miracle that makes them feel sad.
On Saturday, a child was found in a sacristy.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman trapped under a rock rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national launch team, has trained two launchers lost to the earthquake for the Asian Games which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, said Mr Mandagi.
“As a senior in the field of launchers, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how he was eager to send WhatsApp messages to surfers in Palu who participated in the beach festival after hours of news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the launcher community.
The message sent has only one gray-coloured rait sign compared to two blue-colored rait signs.
"I don't think the message came," he said.
Thieves robbed $26,750 during ATM recharging in Newport on the Levee
The thief robbed $26,750 of Brink employees who filled in money at the Newport on the Levee ATM on Friday, according to news released by the Newport Police Department.
Brink's employees vacated ATMs at the entertainment complex and were ready to send more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While Brink's employee was busy doing his job, a man ‘runs toward his back' and steals a bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene based on the report, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the thief should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rap singer Kanye West changed his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change of his name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "This man is officially known as Kanye West."
Kanye West, 41, called Ye for a while and he used the nickname as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change occurred during his appearance on the Saturday Night Live show where he is expected to release his latest album Yandhi.
"She replaced singer Ariana Grande who canceled her appearance in the show over ‘emotional issues,'" the show's creator said.
Kanye West previously said that the name has a religious meaning and is also an abbreviation for his current professional name.
"I believe ‘ye' is a common word often found in the Bible and it means ‘you,'" Kanye West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you too. I'm us too. We're us.
It changed from Kanye, meaning only one, to Ye - a reflection of our good, evil and confusion as well as everything.
The album is more than a reflection of our own true image."
He was one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Kanye West's former co-worker JAY-Z can also accept it without or with cross-sections and uppercase letters.
President of Mexico, AMLO has vowed not to use military action against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military action against civilians as the country nears the 50th anniversary of the bloody tragedy against students.
AMLO vowed at Plaza Tlatelolco on Saturday that it would "never use the military to repress the Mexicans."
The military opened fire on civilians protesting peacefully at the plaza on October 2, 1968, which left 300 civilians dead as left-wing student movements began to take root throughout Latin America.
AMLO vowed to support young Mexicans by subsidizing monthly to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said the unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracted young people to be involved in criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its artificial intelligence fund
"The United States should double the amount of funding in the field of artificial intelligence as China is becoming increasingly active in that field," said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence practitioner who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The view came after the U.S. government made an announcement about artificial intelligence despite the U.S. itself as a whole lacking official artificial intelligence strategies.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the allocation of artificial intelligence studies is a good start as all other countries are far behind the United States and we want to have the next success in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"Double funding could increase the chances of the next major achievement of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, CEO of Sinovation Ventures who has invested in one of China's leading companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that had defeated the best American Othello player while still studying at Carnegie Mellon University. Later, he became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous US government technology competitions such as the Robot Challenge from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and wanted to know when the next competition would be held so that he could identify new talents.
"Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to win government aid," Lee said.
"It is not China that takes on academic leaders but corporate companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have appointed great talents from universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changing immigration policies could also help the United States support its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD graduates in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China released its Future Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
“The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funds to people in academic institutions. It parallels the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations divide funds into US researchers but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center aimed at gathering partners from industry and academies. The White House announced a line of Selected Committees for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, a U.S. bill trying to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence is seen as not being implemented in recent months.
The Macedonian people voted to change the country's name.
The Macedonian people held a referendum on Sunday to determine the change of name to the ‘Republic of North Macedonia'. An act that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece in which Greece has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia, insists that the name ‘Macedonia' represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed to reject Macedonia's participation in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on a proposed change of name in June but nationalist opposition said the change undermined the identity of the predominantly Slavic ethnic Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the vote cast doubt on whether the referendum would reach the minimum 50 per cent vote required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was written: "Do you agree to join NATO and the EU with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev saying "The acceptance of the new name is a price worth paying to join the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country and for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union because that means our lives are safer," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Despite being illegal, lawmakers said they would abide by the vote's decision to make it final.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The country's electoral commission said there were no reports of non-ruled matters happening as of 1pm.
However, voter turnout was 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in parliamentary elections in 2016 after 66 per cent of registered voters cast ballot papers.
"I came to vote because of my children. Our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko cast ballot papers in Macedonia for the country's name change that would pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the EU in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was setting up a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tent set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU but we want to join it with pride and not this way," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor people, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said participation in NATO would provide sufficient investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is above 20 percent.
I believe a large majority will accept because more than 80 per cent of our population voted for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the ‘yes’ decision was a ‘confirmation of our future.'
A poll was published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies which said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - below the required amount.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, found that as many as 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a vote to be successful the number of voters coming in must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure in the referendum would be considered the first serious blow to pro-Western government police since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton's entire defensive line to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent off as Brighton defenders at Manchester City and won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look very happy on his network in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a delivery in the middle of the pitch at the start of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defences, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green-clothed players.
He refused a defense before chasing several more men on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he refused to send it to the left, looking for Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right butt to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with one kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received an inside ball in the Brighton area during the match.
He made a beautiful pass ball through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling to a distant position.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the network before sliding out of bounds.
City against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage played at 12:55 pm on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scherzer hopes to face the fort on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a run-off implication for the Rockies, who hold one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched at least a special chance spot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock in their first division champions.
"Even if we're just playing, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and other teams going to play probably at the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I want to fight in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a newbie for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to make a throw in this situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, holds a warm-up session on Thursday and will make a throw on his usual day of rest on Sunday.
The right-hander from Washington was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 hits right in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
The president did not directly refer to the situation around the High Court voting for Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the number of Republicans coming to the midterm elections.
"Everything we have done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to face the most important elections in our lives.
I don't compete but I'm very competitive and that's because I'm everywhere fighting for a great candidate," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this damn radical group of Democrats, you see it's happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means, you see cruelty, evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to break in order to gain power and control. What they want is power and control, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to ‘reject and deter.'
"And you've seen that for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angerous, evil and untrue."
She referred to the position of Justice Committee Senator Democrat Dianne Feinstein by name, who had received a strong boo from the audience.
"Remember the answer?
Did you leak the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, I'm waiting for one - it's a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labor is no longer a large church.
It's completely unacceptable for anyone to express their views.
When a Momentum activist in my local party voted to denounce me, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I'm the latest in the line of AP Labor to be told that we're not welcome - all for voicing our views
My parliamentary friend Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because she supported the anti-gay.
In my case, the denunciation movement has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the interest of responsibility about economic policy, about national security, about Europe, the irony of the issue is almost the same as what Jeremy disagreed with the previous leader.
The notice of the meeting for the Nottingham East Labour party on Friday said that "we want an all-encompassing and productive meeting."
During my nearly eight years as a local Labor AP, the GC meeting on Friday night really covered all of that.
Sadly today, it is not the tone for many meetings and the political promise of ‘better, softer' has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It is becoming more evident that differences of opinion are unacceptable in the Labour party and each opinion will be judged on whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as a colleague who had previously been, I think sharing nearly the same political views started expecting me to make a U-turn and take a position that I would not agree with - either over national security or the EU single market.
When I speak outside - and it doesn't matter what I say - then it will be followed by criticism for abuse on social media, told not to vote, denounced the political center, told me to quit the Labour party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than my co-workers for commenting on me more on politics.
I was amazed by the professional attitude and persistence of my co-workers who were showered with sexist and racist vows every day but never gave up.
One aspect of the political disappointment of this era is how the level of abuse has become accustomed.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour party foster cultural tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a vast church and with every ‘no-belief' motion or change to election rules, the party is getting narrower.
I received a lot of advice from two years ago urging me to stay quiet, not stand out too much and then I would ‘be good.'
But that’s not my goal in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, raised by the abandonment of the Thatcher government that left my entire grade class devastated, I've tried to lead better public services for those in desperate need - either as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East may be confused about my position and the discrepancies with the current leadership.
To those who support the proposal on Friday, what I want to say is that when the country rejects Brexit, it will engulf our households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the feeling of wasting my time and energy on my loyalty to Labour party leaders.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voters, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise not-elected threats or political suitability doesn't stop me from acting in what I believe is in the interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the AP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The unrivalled Ayr climb to the summit
Two slow attempts may make the final decision skewed, but no doubt Ayr deserves success in this exciting and entertaining Premiership match.
They are now in the top spot on the table, the only one that has never lost out to 10 people.
Finally, their superior defense, as much as they took chances, which made the home team and coach Peter Murchie happy.
"We've been tested for our game so far, and we still can't beat it, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thanks to Ayr, they took a better chance than us."
Grant Anderson made a try in the 14th minute, a conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr ahead, but, a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, was issued for the match by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to make the network and Jason Baggot caught an unconverted try.
Climo led Ayr with a penalty, before, at half-time, he got points then a solo conversion attempt to make 17-5 to Ayr at break time.
But Melrose started the second time well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, a conversion by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken out, and from the restart, Ayr continued forward again through Stafford McDowall's attempt, a conversion by Climo.
Ayr's replacement captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose countered the extra player with Bruce Colvine's non-conversion attempt, at the end of a time of intense pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card due to Climo's tackle without the ball, from the outside of the penalty line, MacPherson screeched in the back to hit the forward Ayr.
Climo's conversion, as he did was almost like a restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent away winger Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth try.
Still Game stars are poised for a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Kieran is seen as ready to move into the hospitality industry after he was named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, where he co-wrote and starred alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last on the show, and it seems Kiernan is planning a lifetime after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wanted to engage in a ‘developing restaurant business.'
'The ocean is ours': Bolivia's landlocked court hopes to reopen passage to the Pacific
Marine guards at the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings fly the blue flag of the sea.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon was laced with a motto: 'The ocean is ours in fact.
Getting back is a responsibility."
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of losing the coast to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century remains clear - like a longing to navigate the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope may be the highest in the century, as Bolivia is still awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on Oct. 1 after five years of talks.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course hopes for a positive decision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will take sides with Bolivia's claim - after centuries of talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president - who faces a controversial match for next year's re-election - is also of much interest in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision in favor of Bolivia - and if it does happen very little will change.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to award territory to Chile, and has ruled that it will not decide on a possible outcome of the talks.
On the ICJ's decision to come out only after six months of final arguments are heard to show the case is "not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, Chile's international legal expert.
And not to slow the Bolivian base any longer, for these four years there may be a hindrance.
"The issue for the passage to the sea has been seized by the Bolivian administration now," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' rhetorical hostility has reduced Chile's little compassion, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be too difficult to hold talks later.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were usually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end a 139-year dispute for the common good," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most prominent presidents in Latin America - used maritime issues as political aid.
"Bolivia never gave up on her right to get a direct route to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we have to forget the past."
North Korea says nuclear war will not happen unless it trusts the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not commit their nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be looking to restart nuclear diplomacy that stalled more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was “just a dream” that continued U.S. sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War would lead North Korea to surrender.
Washington has been careful to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang making a major arms crackdown.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about launching weapons that are seen as the only way to ensure its national security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show introduces the latest design of a large headdress on its way to the main street near you.
If you want to add to your hat collection or block the sunlight completely, then there's no need to look far.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a variety of large-sized odd headpieces for their SS19 collection on stage showcasing the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
The impractical hat has swept Instagram this summer and this designer has sent their personalised designs to the stage of the show.
A prominent design by Valentino is a great water-yellow hat decorated with thick imitation feathers that are wide covering the head of the model.
Other large-sized accessories include gem-decorated, smart hats and even pineapples - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks - and a great time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have been sewn on his lips and more resemble Hannibal Lecter than elegant clothing.
One design resembles scuba diving equipment equipped with snorkels and goggles, while the other looks like a liquid ice cream cone.
And if you keep up with the big fashion reality - you're lucky.
A very large bonnet may be heading to the main road near you.
A warm-sized hat from 'La Bomba', a straw hat with a full two feet wide has been seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The king of the label behind the highly impractical hat was plastered on social media sending another big design to the stage of the show - a straw beach bag almost as big as the model covering the bathing suit he was wearing.
The rafia bag is orange in flames, decorated with rafia edged and added to the white handle, which stands out in Jacquemus' collection La Riviera SS19 in the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for the coming summer - because the designers have made an enormous impact and it's hard to let the asking for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish private schools maintain a track record for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of excellent examination results, reinforced by individuals and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by the Scottish Board of Private Schools (SCIS), strives to serve at the best level to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students to pursue higher education, their chosen career, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that they can and implement an earlier school curriculum, we see the modern language continues to be well-known and the subject of choice required within the school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language that is understood, it will go into his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it will come into his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we can see that language is the top subject in the league table with the highest pass rates in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn a foreign language get a higher grade A.
This data, collected from 74 SCIS school members, showed 72 percent of students got a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of them studied German, 69 percent of them learned French and 63 percent studied Spanish also got an A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that children and young people will no doubt need it in the future.
The current language, as an optional subject, is being held just as is the subject of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found employers' reasons for struggling to meet the vacuum, 17 percent linked to language skills shortages.
Because of that over and over again, language skills have become a must to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective employment opportunities requiring language, these skills are essential in this global world.
Regardless of a person's chosen career, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having this kind of lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country will put someone who controls many languages automatically ahead of the competition.
According to YouGov's poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough for a conversation, with French as a conversational language used only by double-digit percentages, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially the country is developing its economy, will equip children with better opportunities in finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will be different in the language they learn.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach a language that is seen as crucial for the UK when it comes to looking ahead in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there are often many languages to choose from in private schools, with an instructor who specializes in the department.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what happens in the future.
It is undeniable at this time, in a global business environment, that language continues to be very important to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern language should be considered an ‘international communication skill.'
Private schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Council of Scottish Private Schools
LeBron will make his first appearance for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening pre-season game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's going to play has yet to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers announcer Mike Trudell said that James might be playing in a limited time.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game preseason schedule for the Lakers.
"I don't need a game before the season to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump began a hasty rally campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was Trump's first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on hold for him to vote to fill the vacancy in the Federal Court, Trump is aiming to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is decided in Nov.
What time is Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how are you watching online?
Trump's rally at Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the trial this week for Federal Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is strained over the prosecution of sexual misconduct with confirmation of a Senate vote that is expected to be held for a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main target of this hasty rally is to help Republicans gain momentum in the face of November's election.
Thus, President Trump's campaign says five rallies in the next week are "to empower volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical of his agenda that the president will go as far as possible to our inner states towards a busy campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring in supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing him in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to support him," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. troops show courage to fight in ensuring hope is still there heading into Sunday's singles match
After three side-by-side matches, a corner match on Saturday afternoon is probably what the Ryder Cup needs this time around.
Momentum swinging is a concept of sports that is an invention but it is completely trusted by players, and even more so in competitions like this.
Where's the momentum now?
"They have a six-point advantage and now it's four-point, so we're bringing a bit of momentum, I think," Jordan Spieth said as he walked out at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, four points ahead with twelve more points to grab.
American players, as Spieth said, feel they have a bit of an edge and a sense of being driven, not only from Spieth and Justin Thomas who play together all day long and have three out of four points each.
Spieth showcases the venomous game from the start to the green area and sets an example for other players.
The lively cheer grew louder as he continued to advance, performing a swipe that was crucial to match his four-point lead when he and Thomas missed out after two points.
His sweltering blow that gave them the victory on the 15th hole was greeted with the same cheer, which tells you that he believes the American team is still fighting.
"You just have to work harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all there is to all these players right now.
18 holes to show power.
The only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the story of the indisputable Ryder Cup.
This pair of players is a very interesting character from Europe but loves four points out of four and doesn't seem to make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do bogies on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
That period and the way their energy is provided and demonstrated by supporters is proof they are players to be beaten on Sunday, and no player is more popular to block the possibility of a European victory during the sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The two of them are in a different hole.
However, the conversation about the European team's victory was too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson facilitated the work of Sergio Garcia, a four-player hero this morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogi and two doubles in the first nine holes made it difficult for the Spanish and Swedish players.
However, on Sundays, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to watch more closely because of the interaction between the pair, the advice given and not given and the strategy that can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe played better as a team so far and took a long lead on the last day but the four-day session also showed the U.S. team had the courage that was previously doubted by many, including local fans.
European teams lead 10-6 towards the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe carried a comfortable advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after emerging from a four-ball and four-player game with 10-6 points over the United States.
Both greats, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods to bring their victory in Le Golf National to four points.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorn sought to retain the trophy seized at Hazeltine two years ago, taking control of the erratic American side in the morning four-ball session, with a draw of 3-1.
U.S. teams gave more competition in a four-player game, winning two games, but were unable to bridge the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 points from 12 points in Sunday's singles match to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European player to win four points in a row during his time with Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend that is the second pair to win four points from their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then together defeated Woods and new American player Bryson Dechambeau in a 5&4 fight.
Woods, who went through two tough games on Saturday, showed off his brilliance but has now lost 19 of 29 four-ball and four-player matches and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not play a break during the morning session of four balls, returned to team with Henrik Stenson in a four-player match to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1 - taking the top one and three positions in the world.
Europe is unlucky on a quiet and relaxing day in southwest Paris.
Three-time major championship winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas were the gauges for America by two points on Saturday.
They won 2&1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and then again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4&3 match in a four-player game that lost in the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team four points behind heading into the singles game, although as the defending champions Furyk's side only needed a tie to retain the trophy.
After taking second place for two days, Sunday's counter-attack seemed to be beyond their reach.
North Korea says it is 'impossible' they would disarm voluntarily without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions have caused their deep distrust of the United States and that it is unlikely that his country would voluntarily give up nuclear weapons in the situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, shutting down nuclear testing sites and promising not to expand the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there would be no confidence in the security of our country and in such circumstances, it would be impossible for us to disarm in the first place."
While Ri reprimanded North Korea's complaints about Washington's opposition to a "leveled" approach to nuclear termination in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking a step back and forth, the statement seemed important because it did not reject voluntary rejection as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for "the nuclear end of the Korean peninsula" while Trump gave assurances to North Korea's security.
North Korea is trying to find an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to follow a proposal to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "first intensity" and increasing the level of pressure in sanctions to achieve their goals by force, and even against "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that restrictions can weaken us is the empty dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is a constant restriction that further exacerbates our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted during a U.N. summit earlier this week.
The minister only mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party on this termination issue is South Korea and not the US, the nuclear termination from the Korean peninsula will not find a deadlock."
However, Ri's speech tone differed dramatically from last year's, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with a North Korean rocket was inevitable after Trump's "Evil President" named Kim a rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations conference, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work remains to be done and restrictions should remain in place until North Korea ends its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we feel a full, final and confirmed nuclear shutdown."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program financing.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours after it had condemned him for making "gangster-like claims."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to reveal the missile sites as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "same steps" Kim was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and were heading towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all of its students more sleep in an effort to combat a culture of learning that is becoming more and more so through 'overnight' based on caffeine.
A teaching staff finds students at the world's number one university often can't understand the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared a course he believed was the first of its kind in the United States.
He gained the inspiration to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation during learning.
‘At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said: ‘Why am I only told about this now, in my senior year?’
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - and that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students the need for good sleep habits to help academic performance and exercise, as well as improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding its students were sleep deprived throughout the week.
The one-hour course involves several interactive assignments.
In one part, there is an image of a dormitory room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep routines.
In other sections, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons, then encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it's not going to change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health consequences when choosing to smoke," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride in ‘staying up all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing stress on students mean sleep deprivation is an increasingly tapering problem.
Ensuring you have enough quality sleep, it should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, making it constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken his class last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to develop the course across campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same learning program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler suggests that students should consider the use of alarm clocks before and even after sleep, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can damage your circadian rhythms from moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal beats Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another defeat at home when Dolly Menga's network tied Steven Gerrard's weak side with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox are still looking for a first-place win since the February 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to cause his side to miss eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership league predecessor Hearts.
Menga exploded in the seventh minute before the first half and the Rangers seemed to have no idea of equalising.
With Rangers now down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third and was just behind Hibernian with a goal difference.
And Rangers may face problems again after the line-up, Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after being thrown from his team's field.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team that advanced to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup after defeating Ayr.
Holt kept the same team as Livi 11 who stole one point from Hearts last week and he's certainly happy with the way his team's game is worrying their opponents at all times.
Rangers may have dominated the game but Livingston made more attempts on goal.
They were supposed to score just two minutes later when Menga's first touch gave Scott Pittman space through Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed.
A free-kick from the back of Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only send the ball behind the goal.
The Rangers managed to regain control but it remained just a hope in the last thirty minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a penalty in the forty-fifth minute when he and Steven Lawless clashed but referee Steven Thomson let the Colombian appeal.
Rangers only managed to give two attempts right in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily fended off Lassana Coulibaly's header and weak kick Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be against the pace of the game, no one can deny their chances.
The Rangers once again failed to deal with Jacobs' planned move.
Scott Arfield was only stiff when Declan Gallagher swung the ball to Scott Robinson who calmly sent to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard made the switch during break time by converting Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and it almost gave an immediate impression when the winger gave the ball to Morelos but the impressive Kelly came out of his area to block.
But Livingston continued to make it difficult for the opposing team to play the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sending out fares for fares.
Holt's side were supposed to widen the gap in the final rounds but McGregor defended well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow's header slipped from goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton appealed for another penalty kick when he collided with Jacobs but again Thomson ignored him.
Almanak: The Creator of Geiger
And now, the page of our "Sunday Morning" Almanak: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and LOOKING... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to a device called PengiraGeiger.
As a major science foundation since then, the Geiger Counter has been the backbone of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring unidentified scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "It is the Geiger Count, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can actually hear the effect of atoms given by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: Yeah, it sounds right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the creation that carries his name continues to endure.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify bad cells as part of treatment.
The method involved is to extract the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory.
It can 'see' the proteins that are common to many cancer cells and then be reinjected.
The trial vaccine showed promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, recovers from her ovarian cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so they can "see" the protein that is common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our test results show that we have a very good vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explains Prof Berzofsky.
The same approach to taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating this type of leukemia.
Kanye West Joins Pro-Trump Scam, Wearing MAGA Hat, After His SNL Appearance.
It's not well received.
Kanye West was ridiculed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a great performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would contest in 2020.
After performing his third song that night titled Ghost Town in which he wore the ‘Make America Great' hat, he continued to defy Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"A lot of times I ask white people and they say: 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'
“If I’m worried about racism, I’ve moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star played Brett Kavanaugh's confession in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Kanye West's footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
I'm not sure if Rock is trying to make fun of West with the delivery.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he has had difficulty behind the stage about his hat.
"They bullied me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out there with that hat.’
They're bullying me!
Then they said, "I'm in an unimportant place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "You want to see that inconsequential position?" by saying that he would "put on my superman coat, because it means you can't lead me. You want the world to move forward?
Try the love."
His comments drew ridicule at least twice from the audience and the SNL cast appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The whole studio was silent."
West was brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, where her ex-boyfriend, singer Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who sent a tweet: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR YOUR CHILDREN ABOUT THE CRITICAL."
But Karen Hunter, the host of the interview show, said West was just “being himself and that’s great.”
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe accepts and shares an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now known as "the man formerly known as Kanye West."
He wasn't the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course his song refers to the music of legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later also as an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in a stampede at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast's Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington plays the role of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword hero character as Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has grossed the stereotype of the maco hero, citing his character played on the screen meaning young people often feel like they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something was wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Games of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted she felt "very strongly" about tackling the problem.
"I think it's quite strong personally, in the present moment - where are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we taught men as they grow up, in terms of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He added: "What is natural and what is taught?
What's on TV, and on the streets, that makes boys feel like they need to be guys like this?
I think that's one of the most important questions right now - how do we change it?
"There's something wrong with young people right now."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be performing any preludes or follow-up to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "finished with a battlefield and horses."
In November, Kit will star in the remastered film True West by Sam Shepard which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a pirate.
The actress recently revealed she thought meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing that happened in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so that way, it gave me a family of the future and my life started from here," she said.
Rose takes on the character Ygritte, the love of Jon Snow played by Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases are transmitted through sex, signaling a change than ever before.
HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China due to contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of people living with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be on the rise.
Because of the country's conservative value, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the spread of the disease is due to insufficient sexual protection in the relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked GOP senators' data, slammed 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the allegations of a staffer who had posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted the claim had been spread by members of the "ultra-right wing" and the website.
"Scam, fraud and more fraud are severe," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
This information is reported to include home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, broadcast by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported IP addresses that identified the cause of posts linked to the Waters office and disseminated the information of Waters staff members, Hill said.
"These baseless accusations are false and a lie," Waters said.
"My staff - whose identity, personal information, and security have been compromised due to these false allegations - have absolutely no connection to the leak of this information.
These baseless allegations are completely false and in the form of frauds."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows he has no character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of doing something they don't do, they can't be angry.
They can't resist.
They can't question the motives of the accused.
They need to be calm."
Fleischer said while comparing Waters' reaction and Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who fought to defeat Waters in the midterm election, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great news if it's true," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had informed "the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities of this false allegation.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," he said, "and they will be responsible for all their actions that can be destructive and harmful to any and all of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - Rowan Atkinson's weak intelligence scam
It is common now to find signs of Brexit in any new film with British slang and it seems to apply to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy fraud franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny Engilsh and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a joke about how bad we are to be the new export opportunities of the country?
In any case, the eye-catching and bored-faced Johnny English has a chance to ruin the situation for the second time - the name of the signal being more than anything else that he is a widespread comic creation designed for the non-English-speaking moviegoer territory.
He is of course a dumb secret agent whose bizarre character to relax the glamour has the character of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a musician who contributed one note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony.
He was also inspired by the mysterious international traveller and spy agent, Rowan Atkinson, who appeared in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, leaving behind the chaos.
There's a great time or two in JE's latest film.
I like Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval war suit and a fan blade attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is on the air, but his sense of humor is very weak and strange, especially "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible are now confidently offering comedy as their material.
The joke felt as if it was featured for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's mistake of accidentally innovating and focusing on Atkinson's films in Bean's persona.
The main premise is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's secret web network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground and disappointing the agents on duty - a very small character for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a proud prime minister who's struggling with political collapse and unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with Teresa May's side character but there's nothing good in the script for her character.
His intelligence advisor tells him every active spy has been compromised, and he needs to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is nervous and now works as a schoolteacher in some luxury places, but gives lessons that aren't suitable for being a secret agent: some nice jokes here, as English offers spy science in academies like the School of Rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, engaged to a submarine commander, a fiery character brought on by Vicki Pepperdine who is quite detrimental.
So, Batman and Robin, who excel in the Sublime Secret Service, return to action against the beautiful seductress Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being affected by a charismatic tech millionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problem: the evil Jason Volta and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventures with small tasks: posing as servants, lighting fires and setting fire to French restaurants; struggling to smuggle themselves into the luxury cruise ship Volta; and English sparks chaos as she tries to use the Virtual Reality headphones to familiarize herself inside Volta's house.
All the funny scenes were well brought in for the final round, but because it seemed friendly and boisterous - there was a bit of a sense as a children's television show about it.
It's a fairly simple movie.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I keep thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that really fits his talent?
Nafi Labour Party plans for Britons to work four days a week but be paid for five days
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that will see Britons work four days a week - but be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to channel savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an extra day off.
It will see staff enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring home the same salary.
Sources said the idea was "consistent" with the party's economic agenda and plans to bring the country in favour of the workers.
Switching to working for four days a week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for employees to take advantage of economic change.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "Policy studies are expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight but working four days a week is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to balancing the economy and in favor of workers and the party's overall industry strategy."
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week in the 2017 election campaign.
However, these aspirations are not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell used last week's Labour trial by advancing his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to seize power from "faceless directors" and "scratchers" at utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire shares because the Labor government can make "cuts" based on the reason they are deemed guilty.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the company's board of directors and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand over 10 percent of the private sector firm's equity to employees, which will receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to provide their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seems more open-minded than his friend from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told him to go to the trial, I said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the charge appeared, and said, 'Did you do it?'
He's strong, determined, clear."
However, Graham's vote has already been decided.
“I’ve already made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh’s tent and he will take a heavy charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know about this: Brett persistently denies it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he's named can't confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any change."
Is the World People’s Party and Has the Event Done Something to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World People's Party, an annual music event with an impressive array of great stars and an equally great mission; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World People's Party will see tens of thousands of people gather at Central Park's Great Site to not only watch shows like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Party, started in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international support group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people actively opposed to it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors to the concert will need to complete several tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, making phone calls or any other meaningful means to help raise awareness of their goals of eradicating poverty.
But how far will the rest of the world be able to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a sincere way to persuade people to demand an action, or just another case of "clickivism" - making someone feel they've done something by simply signing a petition online or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said it has recorded 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who are pushing for movements with different goals.
They say these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will bring change to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, and at least $10 billion of that amount had already been distributed or had already been collected.
The group also estimates that the funds that have been identified have impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
A number of key committees include Nutrition Power, a partnership between UK-based investors and leasing that is committed to "helping children reach their full potential", promising to donate $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate unbalanced nutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Gobal Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, federal government and Global Citizens like yourself, we can make this disproportionate social injustice of nutrition a past story in history," said Ambassador Tracey Ullman during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said after receiving more than 5,000 calls for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has been lobbying to fund a project, the Nutrition Power, which will now reach 5 million women and children who need it.
Responding to one of the Frequently Asked Questions on his website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen has responded: "This is a difficult route and will take time - there are times when we will be disappointed and discouraged.
But, just as the movement demanded civil rights and anti-apartheid before it, we will succeed, because when we work together we will grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the few artists to perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russia from exporting oil - Home Secretary
Washington could "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russia from selling its oil in markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - as it is known, involved themselves at the invitation of the Syrian government - purportedly in search of a new oil market.
"I believe their presence in Middle Tmur is to dominate the oil supply as they have done in eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there is a way to address this issue.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea route is open, and if necessary, to prevent it from ensuring that their oil is unmarketable," he said.
Zinke said that during a speech at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that propagates itself as the "voice of oil consumers" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, stressing the same.
"Economic choices over Iran and Russia are more or less the same, affecting and replacing oil," he said, while referring to Russia as having no other choice and with its oil-dependent economy.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, which is much cheaper for consumers in Europe, replacing Russia.
Trump officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "side-to-side" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said would make Berlin contiguous by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters and it is simply an economic project.
The Kremlin denies Washington is so strongly opposed to this project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy supply cannot be used as a weapon to suppress and consumers should be free to vote," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. action has sparked German national dissatisfaction, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industrial organization, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), has called for the U.S. not to interfere in EU energy policy as well as on the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when there is a third country involved in the energy supply of our country," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladmir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Think Cook" to Run for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says.
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Senator, said on Saturday that she would "think carefully" before becoming a presidential candidate following the midterm elections.
During an open-ended question with residents in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he would consider contesting.
"It's time for a woman to head to Washington and fix our broken government and this includes putting a woman on top of it," he said.
"After November 6th, I'll think about it as a presidential candidate."
Warren expressed concern about President Donald Trump when it came to open answers, saying that Trump was "driving our country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren strongly criticized Trump for nominating Brett Kavanaugh as a Federal Court candidate.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before a vote is made."
However, a survey on Thursday showed the majority of the population in the area represented by Warren felt Warren should not contest in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters in Massachusetts said the senator was not eligible to contest, according to a survey by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies.
Thirty-two percent supported him.
The poll also showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to contest, with 38 per cent supporting him potentially to contest and 48 per cent disagreeing.
Other high-profile Democrats who are also discussed as potential contenders in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin highlights stress disorder after trauma (PTSD) track Palin at Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the armed forces in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is facing, upon returning home, I can feel the feelings of other families who have this PTSD problem and those who come home with injuries," he said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said her son's arrest was "significant" and she said of his son and other war veterans as, "they came home different, rather harsh and wondering if they would be praised for their sacrifices to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, disturbing reports of domestic violence and possessing weapons while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, Washington backs opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia voted against a U.S. policy that prevents asylum for victims fleeing a terror group attack or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties made friend registrations to the court on Friday in Washington to support an asylum applicant who opposed the policy, NBC news reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. A summons session made by the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner and "a member of his son's violent group" had abused him but U.S. officials had rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He's being held in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have the most number of people applying for asylum in the U.S., as a country filled with evil group problems and domestic violence.
The new policy of U.S. asylum applications reinstates a decision made in 2014 in which the Immigration Appeals Board has allowed migrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the Columbia Directive, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "does not ignore state, federal and international laws that have existed decades ago."
"Federal law requires all applications for asylum to be decided based on the facts and circumstances that led to the application, and prevents it from violating that principle," a friend told the court.
Prosecutors have also disputed the policy, which prevents entry of immigrants from hurting the U.S. economy, saying it is likely that these migrants will become entrepreneurs and "become the necessary workforce."
Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled because of crimes of domestic violence and because of the violence of evil groups in June.
The asylum will be granted to those who leave their homeland for fear of being persecuted for racism, religion, citizenship or for belonging to a particular social group or holding on to different polytk holdings," Sessions said when announcing the policy on June 11.
Asylum is not meant to solve all problems -- although all problems are serious -- that everyone in the world faces every day.
Rescue work is getting more frequent in Palu while death toll doubles
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very stressful," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who was dodging her fever-stricken baby boy at the sprawling Palu city transfer centre.
"Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
There is very little drinking water."
Residents seem to be gradually returning to their collapsed homes, searching for their belongings in the water while trying to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged by an earthquake at a magnitude 7.5 that was too devastating.
Among the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken spine and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to a follow-up quake.
Tears flowed as he looked back as the earthquake shook a room in the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There's nothing to save us.
I was pinned to a wall that collapsed, it felt like," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife's voice asking for help, and then remained silent.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and son.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying' with ‘propaganda advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper detailing the common good of trade between the U.S.-China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused China of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the Chinese Daily newspaper's paid ad in the Des Moines Register - the most-sold newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing the Chinese state of trying to interfere in a congressional election on November 6, an allegation China denied.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election described what U.S. officials reported to Reuters as a new phase in the campaign to pressure China.
Being a common practice for foreign governments to broadcast advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now fighting a worsening trade war with each imposing tariffs on their imports.
China's initial move in this trade war was to target exporters in states such as Iowa who support the Republican Party represented by Trump, state experts in China and the US said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijng's move has troubled many American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a pressroom in the Des Moines Register on Sunday wrote, "is now more bullish by posting propoganda ads in our own independent newspapers."
"In broadcasting this propaganda, the Chinese government accepts the freedoms exercised by the United States, a tradition that prioritizes freedom of speech and freedom of the press," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the press in Beijing, the voice of the opposition is very low and you cannot see the public's true views on the direction of China's concerned state economy because their media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the major newspapers in China is avoiding the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans dismiss female voters ahead of midterm elections due to Kavanaugh's story, warnings by analysts
While many prominent Republicans backed and sided with Brett Kavanaugh, a Federal Court candidate facing allegations of sexual harassment, analysts warned they would invite a response specifically from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The high emotions envelop this story and most Republicans say in their records will continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be changed," Grant Reeher, a political science professor from the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, said in an article published on Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher is unsure of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) move to force the FBI to start an investigation is enough to silence angry voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget it tomorrow and also in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they pointed to feelings in the Senate building compound when Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee voted to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic passion and motivation will explode," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's too high; it's true.
This may be higher especially for women voters who will vote from suburban areas and young voters, 18-29 years old, these people do not like the president and rarely vote.
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing allegations of sexual assault against him by a Federal Court candidate, analysts thought there would be an uproar if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This has become something very complicated for the GOP," Micheal Steela, a former Republican National Committee chairman, said earlier last week, according to NBC news.
"This is not just a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh succeeds as a federal judge, it's also about the way Republicans handle the issue and the way they treat him," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helped elect Democrats to the news release.
However, Americans seem to be divided in two and don't know to trust who in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh with more than half in favor of Ford.
A recent YouGov survey showed 41 percent said they would believe or might believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed or might believe Kavanaugh.
Meanwhile, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh might or should have lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI is now investigating allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other charge, reports Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian newspaper.
Last week Ford made a sworn confession before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh accused him of being drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez also said the Federal Court candidate also showed his genitals in front of Ford during a party while he was studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Website Creators Plan to Start a New Internet Network to Compete With Google and Facebook
The creator of the World Website, Tim Berners-Lee launched a startup company to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that uses open source software-based Solid created by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be entitled to access information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's real purpose was "to rule the world."
"We need to do this now," he said of the startup company.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, daily work lists, calendars, song lists and other personal professional equipment.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that are available in one browser and simultaneously.
What is unique about the storage of data in this private platform is that it is up to the user for who can access the type of information required.
The company calls it "personal control through data."
The religion for Inrupt, according to its CEO John Bruce, is to bring certain resources, processes and expertise to help people enjoy Solid.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developer staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer code writers.
Starting this week, tech developers from around the world can create their own free apps without being centered in any location by using the equipment found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team had no discussions with "Facebook and Google to introduce or not introduce a change in which all of their business models will change immediately.
"We are not asking for their truth."
In an issue of Medium on Saturday, Bernes-Lee wrote, Inrupt, "its mission is to provide a business and ecosystem energy to help protect the integrity and quality of new websites built using Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the world of the Internet when he founded the World Web Site Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been vocal about the need for websites to be free.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Web Site Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic for a new era of websites,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: First World War Victoria Cross recipient priest
The only priest from the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross award during the First World War as a combat soldier was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Pastor Benard Vann received this award on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an ambush shooter four days later and did not immediately know he had ever known that he had been awarded the British army's highest award.
A memorial stone was erected and unveiled by his two grandchildren in a procession in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "a glorious symbolism" because the stone would open the curtain even 100 years after his grandfather's brave actions.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann carried his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "infested with thick fog and sustained a formidable machine gun attack."
He then rushes to the border and with "excellent courage" and leads it before firing with a single gun and shooting three people.
Lieutenant Colonel was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - a month before the war was over.
Micheal Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I couldn’t possibly repeat and were so heartwarming.”
He and his younger brother Dr James Vann also placed a flower necklace after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Micheal Vann said "it's a great honor to participate in this march" and added "true courage with the support so many people have given."
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they are given Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay up all night to watch the Bellator 206 but are discouraged from watching the main show.
The list of San Jose contains 13 matches, including six main matches that will be shown live every night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the clash, audiences in the UK were stunned as the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig's show.
Some of them were angry because they stayed up all night to watch the match.
One fan said the switch to a children's cartoon channel was "an unsavory joke" through his tweets.
"Government rules show broadcasts at 6 a.m. are not suitable for matches so they have to broadcast broadcasts for children," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the transmission.
"I'll take the Knicks, yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they were trying to reschedule the broadcast so that viewers in the UK could watch it.
"I think, when I talk about rebroadcasts, I think we can do something," Coker said.
“But at six in the morning on Sunday we couldn’t possibly do anything until our Sunday time, which is their Monday time.
We're working on it.
Trust me, it's a lot of re-posts and it's not all good to hear.
We're trying to solve this problem, we think it's a technical problem.
But no, it's more of a matter of government.
I promise this won't happen in the future.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six - as usual - and we're trying to do something impossible for the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's "low self" sense of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality - but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old didn't realize anything until he went to high school and felt "not everyone is like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she spoke about the gay right to give "hope" to others.
He also spoke after his father's nickname, he wasn't so concerned about winning at the Olympics.
A regular presenter on this long-running show, Kris Young is on vacation for several months due to illness.
Her sudden appearance in Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt "less than" her peers when she grew up because "she wasn't socially accepted as a man or a woman."
He said: "To this day, feeling less than others and feeling different from others are things that have pushed me and given me the strength to succeed."
She wanted to prove that she was "something" she said, so she didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is now a high-profile campaigner for the LBGT and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to stop more countries from making homosexuality a crime.
He said he spoke this way because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any problems and wanted to give "hope" to others like him.
The three-time world champion said the incident of falling in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - was "unprecedented."
Daley married the Oscar winner who was 20 years older than himself last year but said their age gap was never an issue.
"When you go through so much experience at such a young age" - he joined the first Olympic sport at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone in this age group who went through the same challenge.
The couple became fathers in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said "all the perspectives" of his life have now changed.
"If you asked me last year, it's only about 'I have to win the gold medal'," he said.
"There's more to it than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medallist is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with cancer in the brain.
Daley said his father didn't want to accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if their ticket to London 2012 had been purchased - because he wanted to sit in front of it once.
"I didn't get the heart to say 'daddy's not going to be there to sit in the front row'," he said.
"I was still holding my father's hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until my father stopped breathing and it was legal to die so I realized that my father wouldn't live forever," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I realize this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of my fans in my own country in the Olympics, there's nothing else that can match this," he said.
It was also the source of inspiration for her first song of choice - "Proud" by Heather Small - that quipped with her during preparations for the Olympics and still made her roma plumage drooping.
Desert Island Disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is not so ready to face the Ryder Cup this Saturday to be rested
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in a Ryder Cup match, but he needs to be ready to make up for the game's performance so as not to end in grief.
Mickelson, who will play in this biennial event for a record 12 times, has been rested by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's "fourballs" and "foursomes" games.
Despite being the focus as usual for the United States, the winner of these five major competitions spends time being a cheerleader and practicing in hopes of improving the quality of the game.
A man who can't hit the ball straight even at the top of his game, the 48-year-old isn't the right choice for Le Golf National golf course, where his long range is very difficult for a hit that doesn't match the target.
And if this golf course alone is difficult, Mickelson in his ninth game on Sunday will face British Open winner Francesco Molinari who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If an American player, four points behind starting with 12 individual games, starts with a fierce start, then Mickelson's game is certainly very important.
Furyk is so confident in his players, that's all he can say.
"He understood his role today, and patted his shoulder and put his hand on my shoulder and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
“His confidence is very high.
He is well known and has contributed a lot to this team in the past, and this week.
I might not have imagined that he would play in two games.
I thought more than that, but that's how we think we should do it.
He wants to be the same, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most appearances in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be the last time he has joined the Ryder Cup that never matched his personal record.
Mickelson won 18 times, losing 20 times and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought a boost to his team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he likes to joke, he likes to wear people and it's fun when he's in the team room," he said.
"I think all the young players are having fun with him, this week, and it's nice to see him.
He's not just playing, he's more than that.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows their leading position will gradually disappear
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knew from his experience that a position far ahead of what he had could be lost in the last day of the Ryder Cup and made things difficult.
The Danish first entered the 1997 game at Valderrrama, where Seve Ballesteros was captain and led the American team by 5 points but was only able to win very thinly with an eye count of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself after the leading position in front at Valderrama; we also got the lead at Brookline but we lost and at Valderram we won, but it was a slim win," Bjorn said after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to be in front with a score of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in that team that this game is not over yet.
We're fighting hard tomorrow.
Go out and play hard and don't make mistakes.
This isn't over until the eyes are picked up and displayed on the broadcast board.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and we will focus on this goal.
"I've said I'm going to focus on 12 players in our team, but we all have to realise who our opponents are - they're the greatest players in the world.
So happy with his men's achievements on such a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I couldn't possibly have guessed.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow the individual's achievements should be highlighted and that's something different to do.
It's a great thing to be out there with friends and when things go well but when you're alone then your full capacity as a golfer will be tested.
This is the message that every player needs to hear, give the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he needs to give his best in him as well."
Contrary to Bjorn's point of view, his opponent Jim Furyk would expect his players to play well as individual players compared to team events, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to score three points from four points.
Furyk himself had an experience on the last day where the position changed, while on the team that was winning at Brookline before losing to surprise when the European team performed "The Miracle at Medina."
"I remember every word," he said when answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 burned the spirit of the player on the last day.
"We have 12 more events tomorrow, but if you all want to start as fast as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the momentum starts, it will put pressure on the event in the middle.
"We're going to line up our players according to a procedure that we think is appropriate, we're going to try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of fighting back and clashing with Rory McIlroy in the main event, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the European player in the top spot of the first part.
"I made this rule because I think it will be compliant and inclusive," Bjorn said of the choice of individual players.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The German Navy should receive its newest frigate in 2014 to replace a Cold War-era warship, but the ship will not be ready until next year due to system damage and rising costs, according to local media reports.
The commissioning of the battleship "Rhineland-Pfalz", the first ship under the brand name Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The warship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, unfortunately post-submission problems plagued the fate of this large project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that it will contain features such as high-powered cannons, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-shipping equipment as well as a number of features such as reduced detection by radar, red light and acaustic capabilities.
Another important feature is the longer duration of maintenance - this new frigate must be able to sail up to two years from its base.
However, the various obstacles meant this sophisticated warship, which is said to be able to highlight German power abroad - would be outdated by the time it joined the Navy, according to Die Zeit.
This unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when German Navy officials refused to commission the warship in and returned it to the shipbuilding company Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to its builders after delivery.
Not much is known why the ship was repatriated, but German newspapers mentioned some damage to "the software and the devices" making these warships useless when sent for combat missions.
Damage to the software had to be taken seriously as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleships would be operated by only 120 sailors - half of what was needed to handle the old Bremen-class frigates.
There are also issues where these warships are too heavy and this will reduce performance and limit the ability of the Navy to make any improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" warship is believed to be twice as heavy as the warship of the same class that the German army had used during World War II.
Apart from damage to the device, the price of the entire project - including training for sailors - is also an issue.
The project is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - up from its original price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion Euro.
The problems that plagued the new frigate warship showed how much of a German naval capability was missing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in parliament, said the navy was facing a shortage of movable warships.
The official also said the issue was getting worse, as the old warships that had been stopped did not get replacement warships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust settles the life of bats
A recent study being conducted on an estate in highland Scotland aims to explain why bats use the shape of the face of the earth to hunt for food.
It is hoped that this study will lead to the latest findings on the behavior of unique mammals capable of flying and can serve as a guide for conservation activities.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow regular bats, and soprano pipistrelles bats as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in certain locations around the property to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using mobile tracking devices.
The expert analyzing the sound of all recordings will identify the frequency of each bat type and its species and the actions of these bats.
A map of habitats and reports will be produced to create a scaled picture of the shape of the Earth's surface regarding the behavior of bats.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor to NTS, hopes the results of this study will show the most important habitat area to bats and how they are used by each bat species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management such as creating grazing fields and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has greatly declined over the last century.
Bats are threatened as a result of building and construction work that disrupts the place where bats are trapped and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lamps are also a risk to bats similar to fly trap paper and some chemicals used to treat building materials as well as pet cat attacks.
The bats are not actually blind.
Because bats hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use location detection techniques using sound to identify the position of insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, is of particular interest to bats.
They have ten trained experts who often conduct surveys, check out roosts and sometimes save bats.
The organization has also established one of Scotland's first bat protection centres on the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the place where eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland live.
David Thompson of the estate manager said this estate is the most suitable place for bats.
"In Thereave we have a very suitable place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many large trees and suitable habitats.
There’s a lot more we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to live and thrive.
He stressed how important it is to carry out inspections before starting maintenance work in the property because there is a possibility that we could accidentally destroy the nest of bats that would contain bats where these could kill 400 female bats and bats, and possibly destroy the entire local bat population.
Bats are protected and it is a mistake to kill, persecute or disturb or destroy the nesting place of bats.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer for the Bat Conservation Trust encouraged the public to help.
He said: “There’s still a lot we need to learn about bats and for many species we don’t know how their populations are growing.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyers prepare to sue German magazines.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of raping him were "fake news" and said some people wanted to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is said to have paid $375,000 to keep the victim's mouth shut, according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news."
"Not true.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, this is part of my work.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue De Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "an unsubstantiated and disturbing report of personal space," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek damages for "moral damage that directly interferes with his personality, which is perhaps one of the most serious personal rights abuses in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 at a luxury hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's hotel room, where he was accused of bypassing the woman without permission, according to an investigation paper registered at Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claimed after the incident that the player knelt in front of him and said he was "99 per cent" a "good guy" and only fell for "one per cent."
The document confirms Ronaldo admitted to having sex, but on the basis of likes.
Mayorga also claimed he lodged a police report and took pictures of the injuries suffered while in hospital, but later agreed to settle them out of court because he was "apprehensive of the response" and worried about being "disguised by the public."
The 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel the previous settlement because she is still traumatized by what has happened.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester when this allegation occurred, and this summer he has moved to Italian football giants Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever’ over loss of car manufacturer
The UK "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, Trade Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that this was "a bit of a concern" as Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the European Union without a solution, it would stop production of cars at its factory in Burnsaston, near Derby, for a while.
"We need a solution," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of this would result in border shipment problems if there was no solution for Brexit and this would result in job losses.
The factory in Burnaston - which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis cars - installed nearly 150,000 units of cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my view if Britain leaves the European Union without any solution by the end of March, we will stop producing cars at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Several other car manufacturers in the UK including Honda, BMW and Jaguar and Land Rover also said they were concerned that the UK would leave the European Union without a solution on how cross-border trade would work.
For example, BMW said they would close their Mini car factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers' main concerns are about the risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without any solution.
Toyota's car production relies on an assembly base based on timely supply receipts without having to be stored with parts of the car brought into the factory every 37 minutes from around the UK and the European Union for the car booked.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a solution on March 29, it is likely that there will be a clash at the border that industry players predict will be a delay and a shortage of substitutes.
Toyota is unlikely to be able to store inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Finance Minister Theresa May's future plans for bilateral relations with the European Union "must be done decisively to avoid any border checks."
"We need a solution. We want a solution that will allow not only success for the present but for us to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC on Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows we need to continue this very successful supply chain.
Toyota has been unable to say how long its production will be halted, but in the long run it has warned of rising costs and reducing the competitiveness of the plant, resulting in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the union responsible for the management of the union at the factory, said the union members have begun to fret: "In my experience, lost jobs will never return.
A government spokesman said: "We have come up with an accurate and solid plan for future relations between us and the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
A particularly important meeting between Donald Trump and deputy prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may be "rejected into next week" due to a dispute over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as a federal court candidate continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the investigative work of special counsel Robert Mueller over Russian interference in the election, the relationship between Trump's aides and Russia and the possibility of obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public prosecutor or not and further impair Mueller's freedom to continue the investigation has become Washington's hottest gossip.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein planned to wear a secret recorder to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of replacing the president by using an amendment to the 25th constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, behind reports that he would resign.
Instead it was announced a meeting on Thursday with Trump who was at the time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was "not willing" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to prevent him from colliding with Kavanaugh's confession and Dr Christine Blassey Ford was one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of molesting him, in front of the Senate judicial committee, which both of them gave confessions.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which has delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox news on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set, maybe this week, I think it might be delayed another week given some of the things that are going on in federal court.
We'll see how it goes, and I'll keep you updated with the latest news.
Some reporters will dispute it: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
When his host, Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said he didn't hold many press conferences not because he didn't like TV reporters trying to find "attention" but he also said: "I don't agree because they really want attention."
Then he said the relationship between the press and Trump would increase.
"The president has held the most question-and-answer sessions compared to the presidents before him," he said, without giving any evidence.
A press conference will be held, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen we've done a lot of it over the past week and this will replace the press conference when you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions from the press when on his way out of the White House or when taking part in an open question-and-answer session or during a joint press conference with an honorary guest.
The media is very rare.
This week in New York, the president pointed out why he sometimes makes independent and bizarre appearances in front of reporters gathered.
The health secretary wrote to European Union employees at the NHS about their concerns over Brexit
The health secretary has written to all employees from the European Union working at NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hopes they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP had sent a letter for less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed to bear the costs for the application of European Union residents working in its public sector.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union over the withdrawal have been ongoing, and are on the way to reaching a decision by autumn.
But the UK government has stepped up preparations to face a scenario without a solution.
I know this is something that concerns you all.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each of you, regardless of your nationality.
Co-workers from across the European Union and other countries, bringing together a wealth of experience and expertise that strengthens and improves health services and benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is the home of all of you and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury after losing 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Tennessean Mike Organ.
Head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the second half.
"He approached the edge line and suddenly collapsed there," Reed said.
The coach and the health officer gave Abercrombie oxygen there before putting him in a sling and taking him for further treatment.
An official from Tennessee State told the WSMV's Chirs Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/to what extent the injury is at the moment" and that Tennessee State is trying to identify when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-year redshirt claimant, played in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He has done five stints on Saturday before coming out of the game, his total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK and this surplus of money will be used to help the homeless under the latest Tory plans.
The move will derail Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
This stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is expected to collect up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK - money from this will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May said today.
The move seems to derail Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with the promise of providing affordable housing and making high-income people a target.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, money from these proceeds will help the government overcome the problem of homeless people.
This addition - an addition to the stamp duty that has already been imposed including higher duties that have been introduced two years ago on second homes and houses purchased for hire that may be charged three percent.
The Treasury is expected to be able to levy up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year through this move.
An estimated 13 percent of London's new properties are bought by non-UK residents, causing prices to soar and making it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Most of the luxury areas - especially in the capital - have become "silent" because many of the owners are foreigners who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy was announced weeks after Boris Johson demanded that stamp duty be reduced so that more young people could afford their first home.
He accused large construction companies of deliberately maintaining high property prices by buying land but not developing it, and urged Mrs May to abolish quotas on affordable homes to address Britain's "shameful housing problems."
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reform proposals, including rent control and abolishing the eviction of "not guilty."
He also wanted more power to be given to the council members to build a new house.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream - this life must improve for every generation to come.
And that means improving our bad housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair because it is very easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as overseas-based companies to buy homes compared to the hard-working British population here.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is very far away, and the fact of living everywhere with a sense of humiliation is indeed true.
Jack Ross: ‘My main goal is to manage Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Rosa said his "main goal" was to become Scotland's manager one day.
The 42-year-old is looking forward to a challenging opportunity to re-establish a third-placed North-East club in League One, three points short of the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to represent the country as a player.
I got a call for a B cap and so far that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportshound.
"I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there was something that always pulled me there.
"The opportunity will only come if I succeed as a manager at the club level.
Ross's replacements as Sunderland's manager included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he did not feel khuathir was following in the footsteps of such a famous name in big clubs, as he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"For me, success at the moment is 'can I bring this club back into the Premier League?
"Because of the structure and facilities at the club, it should be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to achieve, but I would consider myself successful if I could return the club to the Premier League."
Ross is only three years in management, having been assistant manager at Dumbarton and being one of Hearts' coaches for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa return to level three after being demoted and changed the fortunes of St Mirren from being demoted to Champions the following season.
And Ross says he is more comfortable now than when he was a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's an option," he recalled, when taking care of Allaah.
"I know that the field of management is very similar to mine, rather than playing.
It's probably because I'm so excited to be able to enjoy life and have a good time.
Playing is a bit difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through each week.
"I'm still going through it in terms of pressure and pressure to work as a player but as a manager I'm more comfortable.
I've always wanted to take care of it and now I'm doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something I've liked all my adult life."

The ideal time to drink beer is 5.30pm on Saturdays, according to the study.
This summer's heat wave brings good luck to the troubled British pubs but a string of restaurants are under pressure.
Pubs and bars showed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but in restaurants it fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consulting firm that collected these figures, said: "Continuously hot weather and a longer England World Cup campaign mean that July will follow a June pattern, where pubs are up 2.8 percent, unless restaurants decline even worse.
A 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June worsened in July.
The performance of a pub that prioritizes drinks and bars is very strong compared to a declining restaurant.
Pubs that prioritize food also suffer bad luck due to hot weather, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
It seems that most people just want to go out for a beer.
Pubs and bars recorded a 6.6 percent increase in sales for the month, while food dropped 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM's entertainment and food analyst, said: "This decision appears to have remained the same and has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and social events or sporting events are still a major factor in the increase in sales in the outdoor market.
Unsurprisingly, the restaurant group continued to narrow, sales fell by 4.8 per cent in comparison to this year's comparison would have been even worse with the cost pressure again.
The long hot summer weather hit restaurant operators in bad times and only time will determine if colder weather like ours in August will bring relief."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened one, was 2.7 per cent in July showing a slowdown in the newly introduced brand.

A study by the UK Digital Awareness and the General Teachers Conference (HCM) of independent schools found 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with more than half of them admitting they kept a personal account.
HCM chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing to see so many teenagers trapped creating online spaces where parents and teachers can't track them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice to athletes" in the Scottish Athletics institute
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director during the general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a well-known Scottish race athlete and chairman Ian Beattie explained this move is an opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from Doyle's extensive international experience for more than a decade.
"Ilidh is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from his participation in the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice to all athletes and I look forward to contributing and helping guide this sport at Scotand.
The American sportsman, who won gold medals for the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, now has four Olympic gold medals and is now covering for the BBC, having been unable to walk due to a transcient ischemic attack.
He said: "I had a stroke last month.
I can't walk.
The doctor said only time can determine to what extent I can recover.
It's not easy to be as ready as it is, I need to learn to walk again and today I need to do intelligence training!
Thank you for all your support!"
A mother's milk pump advertisement that makes comparisons with cows leads to conflicting opinions online
A mother's milk pump manufacturer has received mixed opinions online as their ads compare breastfeeding mothers to cows that are being milked for milk.
To launch the so-called "silent and wearable mother's milk pump" the world's first consumer tech company Elvie released a joke-like music video to show the freedom mothers can feel using this new pump.
Four mothers danced in a straw-filled cow shed to the song where the lyrics read: "Yes, I pump milk myself, but you can't see any tails" and "If you don't realize this isn't a nipple, it's my boobs."
He said, "I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm pumpin' my boobs."
However, this ad published on the firm's Facebook page has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, the video has attracted a wide range of reactions from the public, many saying it gives a cheerful picture of the "horrible" dairy industry.
"It's an unnatural decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows need to conceive and have to give birth to produce milk, but unfortunately calves are divorced from cow mothers within a few days of their birth," said one author.

Another commented: "It's definitely a trauma for cows and calves.
"But why not use them to advertise milk pumps for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another added: “An ad that doesn’t have anything to do with it directly.”
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "really funny."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I will buy one if I still give breast milk.
The smell makes me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I think it's the way it is.
It's a genius product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (usually at work or in the toilet) and feel like a "fool."
This is not an advertisement that compliments or assesses the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have all been dancing with hidden pumps in their underwear.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the assumption that most women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pumps are completely silent, have no wires or tubes and can be loaded hiddenly in a shirt in the milking, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even come out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Pam Elvie is such a revolutionary product, it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By equating women pumping with dairy cows, we want to put body milk pumping and all the challenges associated with it as the main focus, while demonstrating an entertaining and connected way of feeling free through the use of new pumps.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Children's Immigrants Are Moving Silently to Camp Camps at the Texas Border
The number of migrants detained has increased despite the monthly border transfers not changing much, due to the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, making child placements with guarantor increasingly difficult.
According to tradition, guarantors are undocumented immigrants, and they fear undermining their position to continue living in the country if they take a child.
The risk rose in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guarantors and other adult members of the family would have to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had detained dozens of individuals who had applied to be guarantors to unsupervised children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those detained had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 per cent of the individuals who are either guarantors or members of the guarantor's family are here illegally and most of them are illegal immigrants.
With that, we will continue to hunt down the individual," Albence said.
In order to process children more quickly, the authorities introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest, not after 60 days according to the previous standard, according to protection workers.
Many will be present via video conference calls, rather than present in person, to appeal their case for a valid position before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer such children are under detention, they will be more likely to become anxious or moody, and this will lead to acts of rage or attempts to escape, according to protection officials and according to reports released by the system in recent months.
Proponents say the concern is higher in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that children struggling with feelings may not be detected, due to the size of the place.
They added that by moving children to the camp town without providing time for them to be emotionally ready, or saying goodbye to friends might exacerbate the trauma they face.
Syria in the direction of U.S., French and Turkish troops to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the United Nations General Conference, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in the country had reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as the deputy prime minister, said foreign troops on Syrian soil under a "terror-fighting trick" would "be subjected to appropriate action."
"They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the conference.
Moualem stressed that the "war on violence has ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been left homeless.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy war until we eliminate Syria" from both violent groups and "any foreign occupation".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, specializing in training and advising Kurdish and Arab Syrian forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the battlefield.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the situation was appropriate for them to return, and he accused "some foreign countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with this return," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a purely human problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given reconstruction assistance until a political agreement is held between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomat said an agreement between Russia and Turkey to provide a military-free zone in rebel-held areas of Idlib had created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish talks have diverted large-scale attacks by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the territory where three million people live.
Moualem, however, said the deal had "a real time limit" and hoped military action would target jihadists including rebels from the Nusra Front linked to Al Qaeda, who "would be wiped out."
UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to arrange the first meeting of a new committee, which contains governments and opposition members, to take advantage of post-war developments and pave the way for elections.
Moualem stated the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing current constitutional articles," and warned against interference.
Trump will win a second term.
With that in mind, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless, as liberal observers expect, the dismissal charges and scandals of ending his presidential term before his time.
In an undisputed situation as "The most dramatic final of a president's tenure!"
At the moment, there are no signs of wear.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average premiere audience of 2.4 million, an additional 1.7 million, four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast had topped the cable ratings, up 3.5 million viewers on prime news night.
"This is a fire that catches people's attention because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the lead producer of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," a story about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He recalled a taxi trip before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, "Because he made me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's a sense of entertainment in terms of entertainment.
True, unlike those on TV, Washington-based storylines can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite or global economic health.
Not following developments is just a pleasure to a lucky audience.
However, it strays far from being a knowledgeable citizen when you find you're watching a panel of experts arguing over Bob Woodward's use of the 'deep background' in finding a source for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather bomber jacket ("a magnificently thick fabric," said The Washington Post) and a sensational description by Stormy Daniels of ah.
I’m not going to see Super Mario with the same view again.
"Part of what he's doing seems to be in a reality program that looks like he's feeding you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pawn Stars," about Trump's story with an actor exchange and a daily plot exchange (starting a fight with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).

When I visited Fleiss this week, the weather outside his house in northern Kauai was 80 degrees clear, but he was trapped inside the house watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He cannot leave TV, not when Brett Kavanaugh is set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is still uncertain.
"I remember when we made a crazy show and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western Civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it was real."

Outer money flooded into the fierce contest of the mid-term election council
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th election saw a flood of money, as the reunification of congressional districts saw two incumbents now contesting for the same seat.
The redrawn district of Pittsburg contested Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in a special election the previous spring.
Lamb is contesting against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of old Pennyslvania, which overlaps with the 17th new.
The map was redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district had been gerrymandered on the Republican side.
The competition in the new 17th began a fierce financial campaign between the main party financial machinery of the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a commonly heard name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat was won by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politically intelligent people have given Democrats an advantage.
U.S. Considers Penalizing El Savador for Supporting China, Then Resigns
Diplomats of the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, with little negative response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until a partner kicked out of the Trump Organization's management team.
Government Department officials decided to call back the heads of American diplomatic representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decision not to recognise Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fine was only imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including narcotics control and economic support.
The proposed fines, including cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions addressed, will have a negative impact on the Central American country with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
After the internal meeting, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year that appeared to be a positive step in preventing migrants heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials decided they wanted the conference to continue, effectively halting any considerations to fine El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now give a speech at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as an import signal for the administration's place of meeting, according to diplomats.
And the three American representatives returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no firm message or fines from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations on the condition of anonymity.
Their descriptions are supported by external analysts who are close to the administration and also speak on the condition of anonymity.
Historical Studies
What's to come next may be a report by the special counsel Robert Mueller on the possibility of a obstruction of justice by Trump, which now has solid evidence in the public record.
Mueller will also direct an investigation into whether Trump's campaign has joined Russia in an attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability on the side, as soon as he is ready to face voters, and maybe eventually a jury containing his equals.
This is all if, and I'm not saying that Trump's downfall must have happened - or someone like him in Europe.
There are choices that all of us have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on how long this struggle lasts.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to make a coup attempt against Hitler, had the West not followed Hitler and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and have missed the opportunity to avoid the brutal killings that took place over the next few years.
The course of history revolves around such an inflection point, and the unstoppable course of democracy will be accelerated or suspended.
The American people are facing some of these inflection points now.
What would we do if Trump fired Assistant Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversaw Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that, in the last year, he had planned to make a recording of the president and speculated that the president did not qualify for the post.
Rosenstein said The Times' evidence was inaccurate.
"How will we act if the FBI's new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and evidence of fraud?
And what's more, are we going to vote for the congressional term that Trump will be responsible for?
If we fail the test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was of Czechoslovak Jewish descent who had been expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had conquered my embassy home.
He survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table that had a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic about battle with Rapid Vienna
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win against Austria, following a draw with Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify them in Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers are using this decision as a stepping stone to a great victory.
"It's a good point because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We played in this game with the belief that we would have got something and we have got one point.
We could have won at the end of the game, but the series might have been a fairer result.
They probably played better in the first half and we played better in the second half and in the better side.
On Thursday, another great European night.
We hope we get three points but the match is difficult because they got good results in the previous game but, the crowd supported us, I'm sure we'll play well and get a positive result.
"Last year was really difficult, between everything that happened with my injury, and the involvement in the club but there's a sense of fun factor about this place right now.
The squad is good and the team feels good; the training is good too.
We hope we can do our best, leave last season and succeed."
Women can't sleep because of the anxiety of retirement savings.
While the survey participants had a real idea of how they wanted to be preserved, some had already talked to their family members about it.
Half of the induviduals in the nationwide study stated that they had discussed with their partners about the cost of long-term maintenance.
Only 10 percent talk to their children about it.
"They want family members to keep them but don't take steps to discuss," said Holly Snyder, deputy president of the nationwide insurance business.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You won't be able to provide family to provide care for you if you don't tell them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as those options will be an important factor in knowing the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you get a way to pay for the expenses.
Funding for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help protect these expenses or self-insurance with your wealth - as long as you have the money.
Complete your legal documents: End the legal war at a time.
Set a health care representative in place so that you can appoint individuals you trust to supervise your health care and ensure a professional is at your will in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the power of attorney for your finances.
You'll choose the person you trust to make a decision for you and make sure your bill is paid if you're not able to.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Describe these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the money that's set, but who's the doctor?" asked Martin.
"What is medicine?
Who will take care of the dog?
Set a plan."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to rise.
In the absence of a communications system, authorities were unable to obtain information from the government of Donggala, a northern area of Palu near the epicenter with a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are the main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala government area 300 km (180 miles) on the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The region, the administrative region under the territory, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the economic backbones of Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala watershed.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but is concentrated only in Morowali, on the coast opposed to Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by Tsumani several times in 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Circle of Fire and is always hit by earthquakes.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western province of Acheh, Indonesia north of Sumatra on Dec 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the waters of the Indian Ocean, half of that number in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Kota Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, in Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A moderate earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya government area of Acheh, causing devastation and panic, reminding residents of the massive devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsumnami.
No tsunami was triggered at the time, but more than 100 died as a result of the building's collapse.
2018: A strong earthquake hits the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, especially in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's daughter arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested, suspected of domestic attacks, disturbing reports of domestic terrorism crimes and resisting detention, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, when a female friend tried to make a police call to report the crime, she took the phone from the woman.
Palin was remanded in Mat-Su's pre-talk facility and held on unsecured bonds amounting to $500, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he had admitted to being "definitely, innocent" when asked about the confession, the network reported.
Palin faces three minor Class A offences, meaning she may be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with minor Class B offences, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time a criminal charge has been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, the youth was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report on the allegations of the attack.
The case was referred to the Alaska Military Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, disturbing reports of domestic terrorism crimes and possessing a weapon in a drunken state related to the incident.
Palin's girlfriend accused the man of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veteran soldiers in 2016 after linking her son's violent actions with PTSD following his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are also affected with the death toll expected to rise in the next day.
Gepa earth struck outside Sulawesi Tangah located in the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show the timing of the event.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach celebrating a party in the city of Palu during the tsunami that hit the beach.
Prosecutor demands extraordinary death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
New York prosecutors have demanded the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a New York City suspect of a terror attack that killed eight people - an unusual sentence that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the Western Expressway in Lower Manhattan, ramming pedestrians and cyclists on his route on Oct.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors had to prove that Saipov "intended" to kill the eight victims and "intended" to inflict serious bodily harm, according to a notice with intent to claim the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges lead to the death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury had charged Saipov with 22 counts including eight counts of murder for illegal activities, which prosecutors often wear in organized crime cases, and one count of terrorism and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "careful planning and planning", according to prosecutors, describing how Saipov carried out the act as "durgent, cruel and despicable."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has long been in charge of the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed for the New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was sentenced to death in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not feel guilty the day and month after the attack according to court documents.
He made a statement to investigators that he was happy with what he was doing, according to police.
Saipov said he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing an ISIS video on the phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal advocates representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We felt the decision to demand the death penalty compared to receiving guilty confessions for life imprisonment with no possibility of release, only prolongs the trauma of this event for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence had previously called on the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
According to Tory MPs, Nigel Farage should be held responsible for conducting Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "move the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former head of Ukip said politicians needed to "feel the heat" from "Eurosceptics" - as one of Theresa May's MPs, suggested she should be given the responsibility of conducting negotiations with the EU.
Conservative parliamentary representative Peter Bone told a march in Birmingham that the UK "will be out now" if Farage becomes Brexit secretary.
But May's challenge was to resolve the split between members supporting the Tories' Remain Members who joined the protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is working to ensure that Chequers' flexible plan remains in place amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remains and the EU.
May's allies hold talks with Brussels despite the impact they face - and Eurosceptic and Labour's power to choose between her package or 'disturbance'.
Bone told the Outing rally meant Exiting in Solihull who wanted to 'throw away the Chequers'.
He recommended that Farage be made a nobleman and given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he's given that responsibility, we're out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit but we must get rid of Chequers."
Setting up a protest against the EU, he said: "We are not fighting in a world war to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British had changed their minds and wanted to remain completely untrue.'
Brexit Tory supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the march, told reporters: "I just said: Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
"Chequers are not popular with the public, the Opposition will not vote in favor, it is not popular in our party and the activities that are on the streets and who have voted for us.
Please take off the Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The prime minister will continue to hold their posts if they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians need to 'feel bad' if they want to betray a decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is the trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here to tell them 'we're not going to let them get away with doing that.'
In a message to a passionate audience he added: "I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel its shell.
“We are preparing a people’s army that gives us victory in Bexit and will not rest until we make the United Kingdom independent, have self-government, be proud.”
Meanwhile, the Remainer marched through Birmingham before holding a rally in the middle of the city.
Activists waved banners of Tories Against Brexit after the group's weekend launch.
Peer Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives about the security issues they faced with party applications during the conference.
"They said they could have an IT system in place and all the technology with Canada and so on, for borders without contradiction, for trade without borders," he added.
'It's all a charade.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "study" to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "study to run for the presidency" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat presented his future plans during a ‘town hall' in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a strong critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November with GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Massachusetts Trump campaign.
He is expected to compete with Trump in 2020.
Saturday's midday event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the crowd using the format of "town hall" since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he wanted to run for president.
Warren replied it was time "for a woman to Washington to repair a corrupted government, and this includes a woman on the top steps."
Arrests made in the death of Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the detention of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was eventually killed as a result," Murphy police chief J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde acted in defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and claimed to be at the scene, had a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed under the custody of East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior with a height of 6 feet 6 who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears world championship gap when the team orders him to win, beating Sebastian Vettel
It was obvious at the time, Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday," the Mercedes team's direction played a key role in this race.
From the start of the square, Bottas started well, nearly beating Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mates.
Vettel got into the pit first and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the group, something that should have been final.
Mercedes then went into the pits in the next round and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton then made a tire action to the tyres that left the Ferrari driver free inside at risk of defending himself after a third angle defensive action.
Max Verstappen started from the back grid and was in seventh place after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead for most of the race and did not change tyres to target a quick finish and intercepted Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He then got into the pits in the 44th round but was unable to increase the speed for the next eight rounds when Raikkonen came in fourth place.
It was a tough day for Valtteri who had made a good race all weekend and the gentlemanly nature allowed me to skip.
The team has done a good job of winning first and second places," Hamilton said.
That's a bad move language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday at the urging of a woman he had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault charges.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly answer the testimony given before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what happened in the Senate showed people were "cruel and ugly and liars."
"One thing that can happen and a beautiful thing happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry and cruel and ugly people and liars," he said.
"When you look at the exposures and leaks and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not leaking."
All right, wait a minute.
Are we leaking...No, we're not leaking," he added, making the senator's facial expression.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and the letter was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I don't highlight the allegations of Dr. Ford, I don't divulge the story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He told me to keep it as difficult and I kept it as difficult as requested."
But the woman's denial was disliked by the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "I'm telling you, it's a bad gesture language.
Maybe he didn't do that, but that's the worst movement language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Agong Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the allegations to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see, cruelty, clumsiness, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrifice to gain power and control," Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee star made up for Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead with a two-goal victory via a blow from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalled the hosts' standings before Dwyer restored the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed a win for them.
This was the Elite League's third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who came from the bottom to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The opening for Dwyer arrived in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
With what seemed like a busy opening time, Sullivan raised the host's points at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became an assistant to Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants won the game during the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side then regrouped and Bouchard again equalised the situation by scoring at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nielsen give Dundee their first win in a late second and he secured the victory with the fifth team midway through the final.
The Giants, who have lost four out of five games are at home, Milton Keynes for the next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Killed to Ensure Hundreds onboard Plane Pass Earthquake
Indonesia's Air Traffic Controller is considered a hero after being killed after ensuring an airplane carrying hundreds of passengers successfully took off.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong tremors continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the ruins of Palu City.
Although his friend, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung, refused to leave his seat in a powerful control tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport, Palu.
He did not step in to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt the tower was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost it this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with disaster mitigation agencies saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"The death toll is still rising as many bodies are still under the rubble and many cannot be contacted," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves up to 6 meters high have destroyed the Palu which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings the body back.
Clean water is hard to get.
"Small shops are being raided everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "Indonesia's Red Cross organization rushed to provide assistance to survivors but we don't know what will be found there.
It's a tragedy, but things can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to the evacuation.
You ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia has been hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says a passenger was missing after the plane crashed
The airline operating the plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia today said one passenger was missing, after saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely removed from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a broadcast that since Saturday afternoon, the company was unsure of the safety of a male passenger.
The airline said the company was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water during an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The U.S. Navy and Air Force said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses felt the plane was missing from the runway.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane got onto the runway in low condition.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to cross the waist-high water to the emergency door of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and he had only minor injuries to the head.
The U.S. Navy said the crew nearby on the repaired pier also provided assistance by using a re-inflatable boat to move passengers to shore before the plane sank into 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network provided that 111 people had been killed in a PNG-registered plane crash in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Analysts give women's nightlife timeline burned alive
Prosecutors rested the case Saturday in a re-talk of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligent analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone records to organize the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he was killed.
Rowlett said she received some location data from some mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, contradicting previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed her cell phone along with Chambers' phone while she was claiming along with her friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had "deceived because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Trellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before the woman's death.
Cell phone records show that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said after Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted Chamber's call text and contact information from his phone.
"He has removed the woman from her life," Hale said.
Lawyers are scheduled to begin the final argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that evening.
The High Breed: Is hip hop sensitive?
The hip hop trio want to change the negative outlook of this genre by filling in their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop has changed away from their original purpose, which is a political message and a mockery of social problems.
They want to go back to the base and make hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK via artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
The NY babysitter sued the couple who fired him for "racist" text
The New York nanny sued the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text that had been mistranslated from the mother complaining that she was "another black man."
The couple denied they were racist, equating the act of suing as "rape."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her disappointment at learning that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
"I don't want to be black again," Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the text.
She wanted to send the text to her husband, instead she had sent the message to Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "uncomfortable" had fired Maurice, and said that his previous nanny, an African-American, was not doing a good job and he expected the presence of a nanny from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one working day and sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, and demanding compensation in $350 a day for six months, the compensation of the residence he has offered, despite no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't have done that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to allegations that they were racist, saying the act of ending Maurice's service was justified because they felt the woman was unreliable after offending the woman.
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you put your child's care on someone you've been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
It's not."
Referring to the charge as "hardening", Plasco said his wife had only given birth for two months and was in a "difficult situation."
“You want to wear someone in a situation like that?
"It's not a good thing," added the banker.
As the case unfolded, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media, attacking them against their actions and logic.
Paddington publishers worry readers find it difficult to connect with talking bears, new letter reveals
Bond's son, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of the person who reads the book first before the book is published.
It's amazing how much we know about Paddington's success."
He said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book, a small toy bear, felt optimistic about his work being rejected, the woman added, the 60th anniversary of the book's publication as "sweet bitterness" after his father's death last year.
About Paddington, he described as "the most important member of our family," he added, his father was proud of his success in the end.
"The father is a quiet man, he is not a big talker," he said.
"But, because Paddington is too alive for him, it's like the feeling you have of having a child achieve something you're proud of even if it's not what you make it.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although the bear is his creation and imagination, he always gives credit to Paddington himself."
My son is dying and I have to say goodbye over the phone.
After landing, the daughter was sent to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, Nice in a hurry where doctors had worked to save her life.
"Nad called me often to say that the situation was severe and he would not be able to be saved," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, baby.
I'll be by your side soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine given by the doctor to pump his heart slowly out and leave his system.
He died before his time and this was all turned off.
I just sat there and waited, knowing this was going to happen.
I can't sing or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I have to hold on."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in the midst of grief over the loss of her son, boarded a plane with another passenger - who did not know about the bitter experience she had.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I lowered my head, and tears poured down at all times.
It’s hard to describe, but in this journey I feel a sense of sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her."
A sad woman sends a postcard to avoid killing herself on the bridge.
Two women who lost a loved one who committed suicide, work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a letter on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for support.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began to experience depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any mother to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, says his son is a potential cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him with a smile.
They always say that their smile can turn on any room."
However, he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother at the time, met his brother after his brother committed suicide.
Davis said: "I'm worried about continuing if this will cause the effects of other things to happen."
Davis created the card, "to inform people that there are people you can meet and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit still - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
"He didn't tell me that he felt sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we saw a change in his attitude.
She was so sad on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their presents, she didn’t look at them or anything.”
He said the death of his partner was a major trauma to them, but they were forced to pass it: "It made a big hole in the family.
It made us split up.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends as the FBI begins investigation
"I think, if we can get what he wants - a time-limited investigation, a limited scope - we can bring to the uniti," Flake said on Sunday, adding that the committee was "scared-out" in a deadlock based on a deeply rooted belief.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their weakness is due to the stagnation.
Mid-term elections are only five weeks away, and on November 6 - if as expected, the Republican decision is not satisfactory, they will grow weaker to get the person they want to appoint to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has made calls to Senators, lobbying them in favor of Kavanaugh, who had worked at the White House for Bush and through Bush has met his wife Ashley, who became Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares a report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats convene.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate seat, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to equalize the series and confirm his standing in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has dwindled since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to South Korea's legislature.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by people smugglers were a major factor.
Pyongyang did not give any public comment.
The majority of North Korean defectors will be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Military Free Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors as illegal immigrants rather than as political refugees and often sends them back by force.
Relations between the North and the South - technically still at war - have improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on delayed nuclear power disarmament talks.
This comes after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in a general sense to head towards nuclear-free on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused U.S. sanctions of slowing the development of talks since the event.
"Without any trust from the U.S., our national security is not guaranteed and therefore, we will not initiate nuclear disarmament first," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "emotional," and did not fit in the Agong Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Agong Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "emotional" and said his appointment was not appropriate to hold office in Mahlamah Agong.
Pelosi made the following review in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Party in Austin, Texas.
"I believe if a woman behaved like that, they would say the woman was 'emotional,'" Pelosi said of the reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both teenagers.
During the opening of his statement, Kavanaugh was emotional, sometimes almost screaming and crying when discussing family and while in high school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "extremely and defamatoryly orchestrated" managed by the still angry liberal Hilary Clinton who lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he was unfit to hold office in the Agong Court, as it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I feel like he has eliminated his own credentials and his actions against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to prosecute Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this -- if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not qualified to hold office in the Supreme Court, but only in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative court.
In the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering whether he would change the decision of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for an emotional, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'How fun,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to show it.
It was a reasonable word of nysta, an inflammation that was months and years abundant, and she did not hold back anger without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a good thing, do you agree?"
She continued, "I was helped by a woman, an executive in one place, who said she was also crying when angry, but had invented a technique, if she felt angry and started crying, she would have said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
Then he continued.
And I think that's a wise suggestion."
Crying is allowed as a way of channeling anger because it is always misunderstood.
One of the most unforgettable memories of an old job, in an office dominated by men, I found me crying with uncontrollable anger, I was pulled by an older woman in the neck - a cold manager I was nervous about - pulling me into the stairway.
"Don't show them your cries," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy to make you sad."
Patricia Schroeder, a former congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart during her presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested for having an affair in a boat called Monkey Business out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, felt there was no reason to stop him from participating in the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a carefully planned decision," she said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates competing and they don't need another candidate.
Some call Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Due to the events happening at the end of the campaign, the woman was left behind in an attempt to set up a fund, and she vowed not to contest as long as she didn't earn $2 million.
It was a futile struggle.
He found his supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give him only $250.
"Do they think I can get a discount?" he said.
When he says that he won't launch a formal campaign, he feels a variety of feelings - grateful to those who support him, frustrated by the system that makes it difficult for him to ask for donations and who target non-protest voters, and angry at sexism - and he feels like a shot.
"You'd think I had a broken soul," Schroeder recalled of the way the media reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember when I thought about it, what would I put on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The start of the trade war between the U.S. and China may be confusing, and even if the fighting is not over, the dispute between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on Chinese exports including solar, iron and aluminum panels.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs that would affect $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in the value of items, the effect of which is like taxing half of goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing retaliated in the same way every time, most recently, imposing a five to ten percent tariff on 60 billion American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the U.S. every time for action, and the world's second-largest economy is not impressed.
To make Washington resign means to submit to the will of the United States, but subjecting to the United States is widely too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
According to experts, if Beijing plays the cards correctly, the pressure of the U.S. Trade War could positively support China in the long run by lowering the .dependency between the two countries.
"A quick political decision by either Washington or Beijing can start an economic situation that is out of control in any country and looks more dangerous than what observers have seen before," said Abigail Grace, a research fellow who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of political escape, Foreign Minister says
Syria said it was prepared for the return of the country's political refugees and asked for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a seven-year war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country had improved.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made to combat terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore to normal conditions.
The situation is now ready for the return of the willing refugees, to the countries they are forced to leave due to violence and unilateral economic measures that affect their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian nationals have fled since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to develop the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from a country that supports the insurgency.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a last point of 16.5, 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Captain Thomas Bjorn's team got the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, struggling throughout the match, unleashed a tee shot into the water at par-3 of the 16th hole, surrendering to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer excelled in all rounds, becoming 1st of 4 players to 5-0-0 since the format of the competition began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was pulled out at 5&4 by the lowest placed player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, dropped to 2nd and 1st to Ian Poulter of England who may have played the last time for the Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia became Europe's all-time winner with a peak point of 25.5.
“I rarely cry but can’t hold back today.
This is a difficult year.
I am grateful that Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm really happy, I'm happy to get the cup back.
This is for the team, and I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia said after the European Championship.
He has handed the task to John Ram who has defeated U.S. legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I felt proud, when I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all competitions in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record.
Odd statistics by one of the greatest players, winning 14 major second-place championships only on Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team struggled throughout the weekend to find the track, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game of golf throughout the match.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance of his team, "I feel proud of them, they worked hard.
This morning, we're going to give the European team a shot.
We're trying our best.
Congratulations Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players played brilliantly.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee and we will continue to move forward.
I love all 12 of these guys and am proud to be captain.
You need to lift the hat.
We have been defeated."
Recent Red Sores: Decreased concentration in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A recent report from the Florida Commission on Wildlife and Fish Conservation shows general confinement of red tide concentrations in some areas of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the number of development conditions reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts - showed a reduction in concentration.
Development of the Red Soil Pass passed a budget of 130 coastal miles rather than from north Pinellas to south Lee area.
Pests can be found at 10 miles to the sea in the Hillsborough district, but in areas less than last week.
The Red Sox are also seen in the Pasco District.
A modest concentration in or towards the sea of the Pinellas County was reported in recent weeks, a low to high concentration towards the sea of the Hillsborough County District, a background to high concentration in the Manatee County, a background concentration to high in or to the sea of the Sarasota District, a background to moderate concentration in the Charlotte County, a background to high in the tau to sea of the Lee County, a low concentration in the Collier County.
Respiratory irritants are reported to be ongoing in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritants have not been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
