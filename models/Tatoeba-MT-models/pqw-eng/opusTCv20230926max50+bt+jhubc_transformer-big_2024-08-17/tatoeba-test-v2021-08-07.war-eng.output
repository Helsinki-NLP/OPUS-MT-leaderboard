You remember you bought me a beer? Now that's me buying you too.
You can't deny that fate.
You don't have any other options.
Nate doesn't know the truth about it.
You can't make me rain any more.
You can trust Tom.
You'd be better off if you'd just stay away.
You didn't make a mistake?
You don't have to buy that book.
You really don't know me, what?
Do you know what it is, anon?
You don't have to panic like that.
You never knew me, Tom.
It's been sloppy.
You're running.
You've really heard of our company.
You're going to get a lawyer's account.
It's going to be my bike.
You're tired of seeing.
I'm laughing at you.
You can get it for free.
You can get it for free.
You can go home now if you want.
You might want to ask Tom for help.
You might want to get to know Tom.
Don't forget to check out your post when you're done.
You really want to do that.
You're not coming in time.
You showed me what it was all about.
You showed me what's right or wrong.
You're going to go?
You are free.
You're lucky Tom didn't come.
You're not stupid.
You're running errands.
You may be too young to understand this.
You're going to have to slow down.
You're young.
You know how to do this.
You're the only one here who thinks it's a good idea.
Your life will be saved.
It's the beauty of what you write.
You've got to help Tom.
You should have helped Tom.
You're going to make me squirm.
Call her mom right now.
I hope you didn't write it.
You're going to have to call it quits.
Let's say you're going to snuggle.
It's important to remember that you're going to have a blast.
You still need help.
It's still squeaky.
You didn't write, didn't even call.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
You came down.
You came down.
You won.
You won.
You're never gonna make that happen.
You'll never do that.
You'll never do that.
You'll never 'round it'.
