Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) were concerned if they ‘looked like doll muppets'.
There was concern among some AMs over a suggestion that their designation should have been changed to MWPs (Members of Welsh Parliament/Members of Welsh Parliament).
This was due to a plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned if it can invite ridicule.
An AM labor party said that its group was concerned, "The designation is in line with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
A member of the assembly (AM) said that his group as a unit, felt "unhappy" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but judged that this was a departure from the MWP's abbreviation for Muppet.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any explanation of the designation for AMs is certainly a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales' 2017 decision authorized the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on a proposal known to gain broad support to refer to the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the issue of AM designations, the Commission preferred WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Welsh Members), but the MWP option gained the most support on public consultations.
AMs appear to be proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach a consensus could dizzy the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to hand over the bill in a matter of weeks.
This reform law would include other changes to the workings of the assembly, including the disqualification rules for AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonian people go to vote on referendum on changing the country's name
The owners of the vote will decide whether their country's name will be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The well-known vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor shows a recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected offers of EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the vote for the name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bells don't ring when the churches in Harlem are in trouble
“Historically, the old people I spoke to said there used to be a bar and a church in every corner,” Adam said.
"Today, there is no one."
He said that the disappearance of all these bars was understandable.
“People socialize in other ways” right now, he said.
"Bar is no longer the living room of the surrounding community where people visit it regularly."
As well as the church, he feared that the money from the sale of assets would not last as long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would come back again from the start."
Churches, he added, could have been replaced with apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not help keep the remaining holy places around them.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings are white," he said, "and therefore will accelerate the day on which these churches close simultaneously because it is unlikely that the people who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
The black congregation who had worshipped in the surrounding area had taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation under Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of retail merchants on 125th street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused the building to be heavily damaged, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild, they built the tower bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at St. Martin proudly called the tower's bell "the bell of the poor"
An expert who rang the tower's bell in July gave it another designation: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the world’s first tower bell played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind who switched to ringing the larger tower bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in Saint Martin in recent months is an elaborate architectural and contractor tale, some carried by lay church leaders, and others carried by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the governing body of the diocese, formed from lay leaders - wrote a letter to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "will seek to charge a fee" on the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old teenager in lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch a lobster in California in the opening event of the lobster season, an officer said.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then rowing in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a burst of excitement after catching the lobster, but then he "realised" that the boy was shouting, 'I'm bitten!
I was bitten!"
His entire collarbone was torn," Hammel said that he realized it when he had grabbed the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The child was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where she was treated in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coast Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a media conference that a shark had been spotted in the area one week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles realizes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan to break down the British beauty market
Sainsbury's took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with convenience store-style beauty kiosks run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial push towards the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion British beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion products and household appliances decline, larger beauty stalls will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if it proves successful.
Investment in beauty became a hunting ground for supermarkets to utilize shelves that used to be used as a place to display TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current range of brands starting from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also gain more space with branded areas such as those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its boutique makeup suite so that most of its products will be vegan-friendly — something that young shoppers are increasingly interested in.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and switching to small purchases of daily food needs at local grocery stores means that supermarkets must do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said that stalls will increasingly look like Malls as supermarket chains attempt to counteract suppressors like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and no-food services.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat outlets since they bought the two franchises two years ago, which it said has supported the sale of daily groceries and made more profitable acquisitions.
Previous supermarket efforts to renovate the beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to split profits from chemical stores in the supermarket.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmaceutical store businesses to Celestio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical franchise, worth <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
It was reported that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of the beauty stalls to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand range is designed so that it fits all needs, enthralling environments and convenient locations signalling that we are currently an alluring destination that challenges the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘dreams' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones went ‘outraged' after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11million lifestyle business deal to focus more on her new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby did not have time to manage the trademarks of their household appliances and accessories, Really.
The couple's business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of This Morning, 37, used his Instagram account to announce that he was out.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' star" Den, Petes Jones angered by withdrawing at the last moment, from their lucrative branded lifestyle business - to focus on her bigger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources state that Jones was so “crushed” when the TV gold girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business royal headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — meant she no longer had enough time to devote herself to their home appliance and accessories trademark, Truly.
Their business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, uses Instagram to announce that he is leaving Truly, Jones flies off leaving Britain for one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly by far Holly's most important priority.
It would be his long-term future, which would make him last for decades to come.
His decision to step down made everyone involved really dumbfounded.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, very close to the launch time.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of the host This Morning, one of Britain’s most expensive stars, could cost the company millions of dollars because of huge investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings, as well as the potential for further launch delays.
And this can mean the end of a long-established friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin had been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones owned a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV host entitled I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on this business relationship."
Speaking seriously ‘and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for making comments that some considered “non-presidential” and had been very positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a "newsreader" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting the second time after his previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a step forward for North Korea's denuclearization.
But denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament movement.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump is more optimistic in his speech.
"We are doing our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship."
He said that his success in improving relations with Kim had brought positive results - stopping the rocket trials, helping to free the hostages and repatriate the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And she defended her unusual approach in talking about her relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d better have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing at the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy an Island, Kill Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental foreign organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok is homeless, there is no national disaster statement, as a prerequisite for bringing in international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so this is rather challenging," Bu Sumbung said.
While Save The Children is putting together a team to leave for Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff could work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute to the relief.
Given the earth shocks that continue to be experienced by Indonesia, this country is still very unprepared to face the anger of nature.
While a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning of danger has already been reported, is likely to have contributed to the death toll.
At the best of times, travel among many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A floating hospital that has been placed in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs to Indonesia’s damaged infrastructure at the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on highway and rail construction.
But lack of funds has disrupted Mr Joko's government while he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes as hordes of Muslims and Christians fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Witness: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge puts in balance sheet against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League by one score in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from outside Chelsea when his side were 1-0 down.
He placed the ball on his left side before kicking it towards the far post.
The ball soared high above the goal when the ball soared into the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell past Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always played it forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and take one chance and not think too much about it, and just take a kick."
Chelsea took the lead 1-0 in the first half after Belgium's mainstay Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue forward gave feedback to Mateo Kovacic on the game, before spinning near midfield and running fast to the central part of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly baited and ran in midfield.
He then did a perfect kick, leading Hazard towards goal.
Hazard made it past the opposing defender and kicked the ball into the corner of goal with a left foot kick, past Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves as high as 20 feet, said Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which is home to more than 380,000 people, is filled with rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been carried out after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John's street, at 7.55 a.m. with several stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was detained on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people around who saw or heard something to come face to face.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still at an early stage but I ask everyone who is around John's road in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may be recording something on the dashboard camera to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt confident that they knew the woman had come to the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing as the police have said, they are in the process of notifying the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just returned to his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
The man couldn’t say anything when he found out what was happening.
The residents are currently being told that it will take several hours until they are allowed to re-enter.
A police officer is heard telling someone that all areas are now being enacted as the scene of the case.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He always repeats ‘this is really horrible'.
At 2 p.m. two police vans were in line and the others were outside.
A number of officers stood in line to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCc, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by quoting log 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Parliament statue becomes the last memorial to be affected by ‘historical rewriting'
His expulsion would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of many of the British cultural and religious artifacts perpetrated by fanatical Puritans.
But Cromwell's society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "tried to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "This is unavoidable in the current debate about the destruction of the statues, that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the palace of Westminster will be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the English civil war was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's wrong descendants would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The remarkable representation of Cromwell from Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a 19th-century proof of opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course the kingdom.
Whether it is a fully accurate representation, is still the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century had shaped the development of the nation, and Cromwell was an individually recognizable figure representing one side of the difference.
His success as Lord Protector also deserves to be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer Pigs Persecute Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeastern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed, bloodied artery near a pig cage in the market area of Liupanshui province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine to the pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have left with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin finds him dead, and sees the door of a nearby pig cage has opened.
He said that in the pig cage was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
Forensic research confirmed that the 550-pound male pig had mistreated the breeder to death, according to reports.
"My cousin's calves are bleeding and destroyed," the cousin, known by the surname "Wu", was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or to his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their fields in Massachussett resulting in the man being seriously injured.
10 years earlier, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until the wife frightened and drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the scent of blood could act as a "trigger".
"They're just playing around.
They're biters, very curious...they're not going out to hurt you.
You just have to give him enough respect," he said.
The remnants of the storm Rosa carried heavy rain extending into the southwestern United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over cooler waters off Mexico's northern coast.
Rosa, however, will cause flooding across northern and southwestern Mexico in the coming days.
Rosa has winds at 85 mph, Category 1 Hurricane, starting at 5 a.m. Eastern Territory time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa likely moved northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Trench began to form over the Pacific Ocean and moved east, towards the U.S. West Coast, when Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push tropical humidity northward to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rain in the Southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour at some point, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected to fall in some parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Flash floods are likely to occur with conditions that deteriorate rapidly due to the nature of scattered tropical rain.
It is not recommended to explore the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause the gorge to become a vicious river and storms will bring local strong winds and dusty.
The approaching trough would cause local heavy rain to part of the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall exceeding half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to become slippery.
This will be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Several scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, before the rains become more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend into four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some severe temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
There are exact examples of dramatic temperature differences along the central U.S. territory on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the warmth of the remaining summer will form and again spread.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. territory is expected to begin warm starting in October with a spread of 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular events to report on the last minute of Friday: An agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh groped her body drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it did not happen.
There are likely to be more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, having watched it.
The company counts average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counting for other networks that broadcast this is not available quickly, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty in counting the number of people who see it in the office.
To put this in perspective, it is the same number of viewers as a football playoff game or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose host’s opinion strongly supports Kavanaugh’s appointment, is ahead of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Fans remained high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being shouted at by protesters when he tried to ride the elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was insulted, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think that he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told, “You have the power when there are a lot of helpless women.”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee hearing.
Cable TV and broadcast networks all covered live a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do that with the understanding that the FBI would examine the charges against the candidate over the next week, as has been requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake has been reassured in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was clear that the Republican party would not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of ‘playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging national interests, of her plans to quit the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews that featured him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson emphasized the attack on what he called the Chequers' plan for Brexit, saying that proposals on Britain and the EU having to collect tariffs on each other were "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect on a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and in prison on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during a fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said that they found Simpson's DNA on the item, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said that he confessed to having carried out the fatal shooting of Wayde.
His contract has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and surrounding residents in aid of the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the region's law enforcement for "persistence and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
With a height of 6.6 feet living in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and soared to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt "destroyed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano spews ash in Mexico City
The ash coming out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern area around the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in more than 24 hours.
The center monitored several times the rumbling and vibration.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash attached to the windshield of cars in the neighborhood around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in activity at a volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude quake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence election celebrations.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarization vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists detained by riot police pelted them with eggs and threw powder paint, thus creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets that would normally be filled by tourists.
The dispute also ensued later that day with police using their sticks to control the dispute.
For several hours pro-independence groups chanted "Not forgetting, no forgiveness" dealing with union protesters shouting, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in the protest, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in this independent-oriented region, a year after the October 1 referendum which is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters prefer to be independent, despite low voter turnout with those opposed to secession and largely boycotting the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop polling at polling stations across the region in fierce clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support the national police.
Demonstrations continued but were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife said he no longer hoped about the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory despite a slight victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year despite many of their well-known leaders, either in exile or in custody awaiting trial, for their role in regulating the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with her cell phone in support of police, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more stressful now," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed pre-trial since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
"Standing as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the setbacks in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage occurred to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired towards the car at some point.
Menga's goal has given Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Livingston's win resulted in the Rangers firing Steven Gerrard from his post as Ibrox club manager, for his second loss in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack has been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt's side moves were equivalent to Hibernian's second.
Gerrard's side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face Hearts leaders who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League, on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their unbeaten run in the division to six games, while head coach Holt still tastes defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a chance against a sloppy guest team
Holt’s team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their precision giving Rangers various difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his effort missed across the face of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only widen his effort after sliding in and facing Craig Halkett's header from across the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play ahead at the start, knowing that they could make it difficult for the incoming team over the occurrence of a dead ball.
And that's the way to come up with a very important goal.
Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got a turn and scored from midfield.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated possession but realized that the home defence was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly as a whole was not disturbed.
The pattern continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to lure the rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was sidelined by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow was knocked out as a result of Livingston's other game tactics.
The attack continued to come against Livingston's goal and was constantly inevitable, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were denied.
‘Fenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
For a man, they are incredible, continuing to exceed expectations on this ever-rising trajectory.
Their playing style and personnel have hardly changed since they returned to the top flight, but great credit has to be given to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the alert during the game.
Nevertheless, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was bad – only once they could break up the home side’s formation – and it was a warning to the Rangers, who were aware of their presence in the middle of the pitch.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed reception in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue skyline on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They are at odds over issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
It is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a crowd of 25,000 gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also spoke out, denouncing both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The resistance protests described a conflict over the existence of an immigrant who was welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as a dictator by others.
Deptford highway collision: Biker killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car had stopped and paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about 1 mile away from the Saturday collision.
Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and alerted his family.
Roads were closed and bus lane diversions had been imposed as well as motorists were urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in chaos
Six of the guards were injured in a riot in a heavily guarded men's prison, the police office said.
Chaos arose at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST (GMT<0x2B>0100) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist Officer "Tornado" has been deployed to deal with the riots, involving eight prisoners and occurring on one side of the building.
The officers were treated at the scene due to minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained pass officers have been deployed to deal with the incident that is taking place at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend longer hours behind bars."
Long Lartin HMP Prison housed over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison chief was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October of last year a riot officer was called to prison to deal with a serious riot in which an officer was attacked with a billiard ball.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Floods
Tropical depressions that hit Arizona are rare, but that’s what is likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy trail passes through the southwestern desert, posing a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings of flash floods on Monday and Tuesday for the Western Arizona region to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to lead directly past Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting Monday night with rain.
The National weather service in Phoenix mentioned on Twitter that there are only "ten tropical cyclones capable of inflicting tropical storms or depressive status within 200 miles of the Phoenix region since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border area."
The latest Hurricane Center Alert tool is able to predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with an isolated amount reaching 6 inches in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to be exposed to 1 to 2 inches, with a possible number of isolations reaching 4 inches.
For those in flash flood-free areas, Rosa rain may be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because currently the southwest region is being hit by drought.
According to the U.S. U.S. drought watchdog, only about 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is experiencing at least an extreme drought, the second-highest category,” Weather.com reported.
First, the path that Hurricane Rosa traversed led to land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico
Rosa, still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encountered cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore weakened its strength.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall may be high in parts of Mexico, posing a high risk of flooding
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected to hit the Baja California region as far as the southwestern region of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then cross the northern part of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will pass through Arizona and into southern Utah on midnight Tuesday.
"The main risk that storm Rosa or her remains may pose is very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern region of Sonora, and the U.S. region southwest of the U.S. desert." the National Hurricane Center (NHC) states.
The rains are expected to cause flash floods and building debris flowing into the desert, and landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: Arrest of four suspects attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton region, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset counties, police said.
Officers have already appealed to anyone who may have video footage of the incident on his phone to come report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh ‘received the hatred and anger' of the Democratic Party
"One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and humiliating stratagem," Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "received the hatred and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcibly and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually assaulted him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's intelligence and quality as well as courage on that day.
"A vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to toughen someone with the most perfect legal thought of our time, a jury with a track record of true public servants," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly refers to Kavanaugh's candidacy as he talks about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
"Five weeks before the election, one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m really racing,” he said.
“That’s why I went there, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to "oppose and block."
The first voting procedural at Senate level in Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to be implemented no later than Friday, an aide to senior GOP leaders told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with the death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed, many drifting as giant waves hit the coast, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) shattered the beach at dusk, causing many deaths and destroying whatever it went through.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the coast and did not immediately run away so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, wood, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through the high seas at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
Several people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the BNPB showed many buildings and shops destroyed, crooked and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
A successive aftershock rocked the city along the coast on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Study and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s massive quake was about 200 times stronger than the explosive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, can magnify the size of the tsunami, can be said to be so.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed building, he said, adding that there were 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damage could have been greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communication "is completely paralyzed by the absence of information from Donggala," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that members and their volunteers were heading towards the affected area.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get worse," he said.
The related agency on Saturday received much criticism for not informing that there was a tsunami hitting Palu, although authorities said that the wave had already hit by the time the warning was issued.
An amateur tape shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of a building shouting a warning of a tsunami approaching, towards people on the streets below.
Within minutes the water rolls hit the beach, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately prove the authenticity of the tape.
The earthquake and tsunami were the biggest causes of power outages that cut off communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes containing aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but refugees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport has already reopened only to channel relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises above 800.
That's awful.
When World Vision employees from Donggala had made it to safety in the city of Palu, where the employees took refuge in a tarpaulin tent built in their office yard, on the way they had passed through a variety of devastated areas, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
That's awful.
Even as the relief group began to move slowly to begin disaster relief activities, some of the group complained of a ban on skilled foreign volunteers, who were about to leave for Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, aid of goods and manpower from abroad can only start to be channeled if the affected area has been officially declared as a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"At the time the Government said, OKE, this is a national disaster," we were able to receive international assistance, but there was no such status yet."
On the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing victims still hope that their loved ones will be part of a miracle that will fix the bleak plot of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of the got.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who was stuck under the rubble for two days with the mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has been the coach for two missing paragliding athletes, who had participated in the Asian Games which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel, along with Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how after news of the ruined Hotel Roa-Roa circulated around the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors, who participated in the celebrations on the beach.
However, all the messages, only got one gray tick, instead of two blue ticks.
"I think that means a message isn't sent," he said.
Robbers take $26,750 during ATM charging in Newport at Levee
The robber on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was reloading an ATM machine storage box in Newport, according to a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car has emptied an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and is preparing to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a news release.
While he was at work, another man "runs from behind a Brink worker" and steals a bag containing money to be sent.
Witnesses saw some of the suspects fleeing the scene, according to reports, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity can contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, she wrote: “The former was formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, already had Ye's nickname for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes were made before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, when she was expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform on the show, which was cancelled due to "emotional reasons," the show's creators said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously said that for him the word had religious meaning.
“I believe ‘ye’ is a commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, discussing the album’s title with Radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we, that name is us.
The name is derived from Kanye, which means the only one, being Ye - as a mirror of our good, our badness, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our true selves."
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has in various ways been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, however this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a connecting sign and a Big letter.
The president of Mexico, AMLO, vowed not to use the military in the face of civil society
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civil society ahead of the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliatory action against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged a day on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to suppress the Mexicans."
Troops launched shots at peaceful demonstrations in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, when left-wing students' movements planted their roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has guaranteed support for young Mexicans by providing a monthly subsidy for those in college and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encouraged young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double A.I. funding.
As China is more active in terms of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funds it will spend on research in the field, said investor and A2 practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who already works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. as a whole lacked formal AI strategies.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: aiming to become number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling AI research funding is a good start, considering all other countries are likely to lag far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the odds so that the next major AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview on this week’s day.
Lea, owner of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was already published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who is already investing in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beat the best American Othello players, after which he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology rivalries such as the Robotics Challenge for the Advanced Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be implemented, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win prizes from the Government, Lee said.
“It wasn’t China that took an academic lead; it was a company,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have already hired figures from universities for AI research in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policies could also help the U.S. to support efforts around AI.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically for PHD title holders in the field of AI," he said.
China's State Council issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions just like the way the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, recently DARPA invested more than 100 million dollars per year for AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence saw no follow-up for months.
The Macedonian people voted in order to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday to decide on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," an act that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has barred its offer of membership to become part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the opinion that the name of its northern neighbor represents a recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned the country from joining NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name proposed, but nationalist opposition argued that the changes would undermine the identity of most of the ethnic Macedonian Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the election and a boycott campaign had cast doubt on whether the election results could reach the minimum 50 percent vote required for the election to be declared valid.
The question on the ballot reads: "Do you approve NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece."
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable price to pay to gain entry into bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born out of the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I come today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the sake of the younger generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few lawmakers have said they will abide by the results of the vote to make a decision.
The name change requires a two-thirds vote in parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
However, it turned out that voting results only reached 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their ballots for elections in Macedonia in order to change the country's name that would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, Sept. 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov had already prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of tents made by those who would boycott the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to join honorably, not through the door of servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most of the population will approve it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his ballot.
He said the "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the vote - less than the required amount.
Another poll, hosted by Macedonian TV station Telma Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be successful, it would take 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure in the vote would represent the first policy rejection of the pro-Western government since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero explores Brighton's entire defence to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton defenders in a 2-0 Manchester City win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the win look very easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received an pass in the midfield at the start of the match.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before desperate to get into the open field.
Aguero later found himself surrounded by four green-robed men.
He twisted past one defender before running ahead of several more opponents at the end of Brighton's goal.
Then he passed to his left, to Sterling.
The England forward used his first kick from goal to pass the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems at his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, deep inside the Brighton region on that game.
He passed the ball with a stunning far kick through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a slight shake of the ball before leading Sterling to the farthest post.
The Sky Blue forward dribbles towards the goal just before the ball slides out of the border.
City face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to complain spoiler versus Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff game, there was no more reason to force another game.
But the overly competitive Scherzer hopes to outscore the Colorado Rockies in Sunday’s game, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who are ahead in one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have earned at least a spot after winning a wild-card game against the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but are still trying to grab their first division title.
“Even if we play without a win, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other teams who will play at the highest level from any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in a match like that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce an opening game for Sunday, but it is reported that under such circumstances, they are likely to let Scherzer come in.
Scherzer, who will start the game for the 34th time, held a training session on Thursday and started Sunday’s game normally used for rest.
Washington's right-handed pitcher was an 18-7 scorer with a 2.53 run average (ERA) and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this session.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to the situation involving his choice of Supreme Court Justice candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, as he talked about the importance of Republican votes in mid-elections.
"All the efforts we have made are at stake in November.
Five weeks before the most important election in our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting all over the place for an incredible candidate," he said.
Trump continued, “You see a very, very, horrible, radical Democratic group, you can see it’s happening right now.
And they decide to take back power by any means, you see their crimes, their abominations.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to defend in order to gain power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angerous and evil and vile and unbelievable."
She referred to Senate Dianne Feinstein serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming her name, which was met with loud sarcasm from her listeners.
“Remember the answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it - it's a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a place of public service.
Now be intolerant of anyone who makes up his mind.
When Momentum activists at my local party voted to denounce me, it was no surprise.
After all, I was in the last order of Members of Parliament, being told that our presence was not expected – all because we expressed an opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she defended antisemitism firmly.
In my case, the denunciation movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, issues that are ironically the same as those that Jeremy Corbyn opposed to previous leaders.
The notice for the meeting of eastern Nottingham workers on Friday stated that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, the General Committee meeting on Friday Night was exactly that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises regarding "better, more friendly" politics is not long forgotten, if, indeed it ever began.
Differences of opinion in the workers' party are increasingly clearly not tolerated and each opinion is judged to be ineligible by the party's authority.
It started as soon as Jeremy became leader, as a colleague I thought I would be able to share the same political views, start expecting me to go back and take a position that I would never have been willing to accept – both in national security and in the EU single market.
Whenever I speak openly - and no matter what I say - then there will be slurs on social media asking for the cancellation of the appointment, denouncing central politics, telling me I shouldn't have served in the Labour party.
And it wasn’t just me who experienced it.
Sure, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual harassment or racism every day but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current political era is how much abuse rate has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should have helped develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer on the wider church and with every "no confidence" motion or changing party rule selection to be more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that encouraged me to keep my head down, not overly voicing my opinion, and then I would say "okay."
But I went into politics not to do that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher's government which resulted in my comprehensive school class literally collapsing, I have been trying to fight for better public service for those who desperately need it – both as a local counselor and a minister in government.
I have never concealed my political actions, including at the last election.
No one in East Nottingham will question my policy position and things I disagree with in the current leadership.
For those advocating a motion on Friday, all I can say is that when the country moves swiftly toward a sovereign split (Brexit), it will harm our state business and public services, I don’t want to waste time and energy for the sake of loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, as a member of the Labour party or not.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr rises to the top
The last two attempts may have rigged the final results a bit, but no doubt Ayr deserves to win a very entertaining Tennent’s Premiership game today.
Now they are in the top, the only undefeated side out of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and the ability to grab the best odds, which earned the home team and coach Peter Murchie the right to feel happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still unbeaten so we're happy," he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “The award for Ayr, they’re better at taking chances compared to what we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, given on that game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Baggot barricaded an unconverted try.
Climo loosened Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, just in mid-time, he scored then did a single try to make Ayr's score 17-5 at the break.
However Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try was converted by Baggot, reducing the odds to five points.
Then there was a long break as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury, was pushed out, and since the restart of the match, Ayr went faster than Stafford McDowall's try attempt, converted by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then hit by a yellow card and again, Melrose made a reserve player pay with Bruce Colvine's unaltered try, at the end of the hard pressure.
The hosts had returned to play, but, by the time Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for cornering Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind the injured Ayr forward.
Climo was substituted, as was the case again, almost from the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe kicked a goal and thwarted Gregor Henry's fifth attempt.
Star Still Game looks set to embark on his new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Kieran looks set to move into the service industry after it was previously discovered that he was named a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old cast of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he directed and also starred alongside his longtime comedian partner, Greg Hemphill.
The couple had already announced that the upcoming ninth series was the final episode, and apparently Kiernan planned to guide the live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was trying to get involved in "a growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours: Bolivia is surrounded by land hoping that the court will reopen the passage to the Pacific.
Sailors patrolled at the headquarters of the parachute force located in La Paz.
The public building raised a blue sea flag.
The naval base from Titicaca to Amazon was polished with the motto: "The sea is our legitimate property.
To rise again is an obligation."
Passing through Bolivia surrounded by land, memories of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a bloody conflict of the 19th century are still vivid – like the desire to once again traverse the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is likely to peak in decades, as Bolivia awaits a court ruling on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope for the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ trial on the big screen across the country, hoping that a court in The Hague will support Bolivia's demands that - after decades of tense negotiations -Chile be obliged to negotiate Bolivia's guarantee of sovereignty over the oceans.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for next year's re-election - also has plenty of support at Monday's trial.
"We are already very close to the return of the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts are convinced that the court is unlikely to decide Bolivia's wishes- and that would only change slightly if it were possible.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to hand over Chilean territory, and has already determined that it will not decide the outcome of the possible negotiations.
That the ICJ's ruling came just six months after the final argument had been heard, indicating the case was "uncomplex," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean international legal expert.
And still far from continuing Bolivia’s demands, in the last four years it may have suffered a setback.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened the goodwill of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point remain in talks, but it will be very difficult to keep discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, the Bolivian government's deputy in The Hague rejected the idea of quick decision-making.
Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales—still one of Latin America’s most famous presidents—used maritime issues as a political backer.
Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The conference is an opportunity to see if we need to solve the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never disarm nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the time of the United Nations General Assembly.
He mentioned the United States carrying out an agreement made at a meeting in Singapore between competing leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo looks to almost start nuclear diplomacy that has been deadlocked for more than three months after a meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was only a “funny dream” that by continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of the Korean War declaration would have North Korea surrender.
Washington is on the verge of approving the declaration in the absence of Pyongyang making efforts to restrict the armed forces first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the recognition of the arsenal for which the country is the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
The Paris fashion show showcases the latest collection of head coverings all the way to the main street near you.
If you want to expand your hat collection or really want to be protected from the sun don’t look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne issued a series of large-size headgear covers for their SS19 collection on the fashion show stage in a stunning style held at Paris Fashion Week.
The really impractical hat has swept Instagram this summer and these designers have showcased eye-catching creations on the show stage.
What stands out from Valentino is a creamy-coloured hat topped with a wide fringe of fur tubs covering the head of the model.
Large size accessories include a diamond-adorned watermelon, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but are not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a group of strange masks—and right ahead of Halloween.
Many masks are of different colors whose lips have been sewn and resemble Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
A scuba diving-like creation is equipped with snorkels and glasses, while others look like melted ice cream.
And if you continue to browse through those great fashion collections – then you’re in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that such a large collection of hats will be marketed to the main street near you.
Large size hats became a very best-selling trend in ‘La Bomba', straw hats with fringes with two feet wide visible worn by everyone including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label cult behind the highly impractical splash hats of social media made a huge creation on the beach catwalk – a beach bag of straw that was almost the same size as a swimsuit – worn with a sash model.
The burnt orange rafia bag, clipped with rafia on the edge with a white leather handle strap, is a standout thing from Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see big hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for next summer - as designers are already making a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for such big accessories'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with outstanding test results, further reinforced by each student and collective success in sport, art, music as well as hard work.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Board (SCIS) strive to provide the best service for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for advanced and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as world citizens.
As the education sector can design and implement the school curriculum as expected, we see modern language continues to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, your speech will go into his head.
If you talk to him in his language then your words will go into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the most recent exam this year, we can see that the language is the top of the league table with the highest graduation score in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn a foreign language get an A Plus grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students got an A Plus grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish also got an A grade.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that will certainly be required by children and adolescents in the future.
Today the languages, as a choice of subjects, are held in the same standard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in modern school curriculums and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Skills Service in 2014 found that out of several reasons why employers should continue to struggle to fill vacancies, 17 percent of the reason is a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their future careers.
With an increasing number of job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are important in a globalized world.
Whatever one’s career choice, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will feel the real benefit of having this kind of lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with residents of a foreign country will automatically make a multilingual superior in the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French became the only language spoken in double-digit percentages, which is 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for today’s children is an important thing for today.
Having multilingual skills, especially the languages of countries with a growing economy, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on a more classical modern language, while others will teach the language that is considered the most important in the UK for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with an expert teaching staff in this field.
The Scottish independent school is intended to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what happens in the future.
It cannot be denied that nowadays, in a global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence for Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for fans to see LeBron James kick off his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play just a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At the stage of my career at the moment, I don't need to do a pre-season game to get ready," he said.
Trump General Meeting Schedule in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump began a busy campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five scheduled rallies next week, including stops at some of the fun spots that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was confirmed that the vote was delayed in order for him to vote for the Supreme Court, Trump intended to build support for him for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote is done in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's general meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump rallies in West Virginia online via live broadcasts on YouTube.
It is likely Trump will discuss hearings this week for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is increasingly tense after allegations of indecent sexual acts and Senate voting estimates will be delayed by up to one week while the FBI investigates them.
But the main goal of this rally agenda is to help the Republican party gain some momentum in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, in President Trump’s campaign, five rallies this week aim to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will as much as possible travel to the states as we face a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally is expected to present supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as draw coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican West Virginia Senate candidate who was left behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey so the president should come as an effort to boost his earnings in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. teams show courage to defend their hopes in the face of Sunday's single game
After three one-sided sessions, a foursome Saturday afternoon session is what may be required in this Ryder Cup.
The swing of the momentum pendulum is a concept of sport that is the result of a finding that is fully trusted by the players, and there is nothing more than in a competition like this.
Where do they think the momentum is right now?
“Before, they were six points clear and now four, so I think we took it as a bit of momentum,” Spieth said as he passed that day.
Certainly Europe has the advantage of being four points ahead with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth said, felt they had a little bit of momentum and they had a lot of things that could be spirited, not to mention the Spieth and Justin Thomas formations that played together all day and each boasted three out of four points.
Spieth has played deadlyly ranging from the tee area to the green area and leading by example.
The shout of celebration grew louder as the turn came, hitting a crucial putt to make the match a draw as he and Thomas lost two against two.
The putting blow from him who won them at number 15 was met with a similar shout, a scream that tells you that he is sure America is not losing.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
All these players are gone now.
18 holes that need to be marked.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed tale of the Ryder Cup.
A unique but interesting pair from Europe is four to four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seemed to flow both to and from this boisterous crowd convinced that they were players to beat on Sunday, and no player more famous than neither Fleetwood nor Molinari would lock in a potential European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It is better if at the same time both are placed in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson shortened the work of Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the nine front are like digging a hole that this Spanish and Swedish golfer will never be able to climb.
Even though, on Sundays nothing can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are great shows to take a closer look at because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how strategies can change instantly.
So far, Europe is playing better as a team and leading quite a distance towards the final day, but the foursome session also shows that the U.S. team has the guts to compete despite some doubt, especially in the United States.
Europe win 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage on the day of the Ryder Cup final after emerging from Saturday’s fourball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead with two wins over Tiger Woods who had to fight record their points so far at Le Golf National with four points.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to retain a trophy he didn’t get at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American side in the morning fourball, making the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in a foursome, winning two games, but they could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's single 12 games to defend the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debutant to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points from their opening four in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball they became very solid to defeat the limping Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a firmer 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally performed brilliantly but he has already lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome as well as seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested on the morning fourball, then returned to pair up with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2&1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three worlds.
Europe did not reach it alone despite a moderately pleasant and windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for America by two points on Saturday.
They got an interesting 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in fourball then came back again to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did a team return from a four-point deficit go into a single game, although as the defending champions the Furyk team needed only the points of the series to retain the trophy.
However, after being his second best for two days, Sunday’s counter-attack looked like it would surpass them.
North Korea says it is 'impossible' to disarm unilaterally without trust
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations about sanctions that continue to deepen their distrust of the United States and it is unlikely that the country unilaterally disarms its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant steps that showed good will” in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons as well as nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation it would be impossible for us to disarm ourselves first unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated the same complaints from North Korea about Washington’s resistance to a “staged” approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be punished for taking a gradual step, his significant statement said that they did not reject fully as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between U.S. presidential officials and the first-ever North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, at which time Kim pledged to seek "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has wanted an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected calls to loosen heavy international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is insisting on "denuclearization first" and increasing pressure by imposing semi-sanctions to achieve their goals by force, and even rejecting "the final declaration of war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions could make us bend our knees is an illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions will deepen our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by U.S. leaders at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: “If the troubled side of this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not reach this kind of dead end.”
Nevertheless, Ri’s tone of speech was dramatically different from last year’s, as he spoke at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean rockets on the US mainland was inevitable after Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at a U.N. meeting, Trump, who last year threatened to "destroy" North Korea in total, heaped praise on Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but that big work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If this takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter", he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Security Council sanctions enforcement should proceed decisively and should not fail until we know that denuclearization is full, final and verified."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to stop financing Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July while saying that there had actually been progress, it was just that North Korea in a matter of hours insinuated that he was making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the location of the missile as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate action."
He stated that Kim had him take "appropriate action" to his liking was a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and was moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year puts all of the undergraduate students there to sleep more, in an effort against the macho culture in learning that is developing through a caffeine-powered 'orange man'.
An academic found that students at the world’s number one university often don’t know anything about discussing a very basic thing about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine specializing in sleep problems at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving lectures on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At last a girl came up to me and said: ‘Why am I just being told now, in my final year?’
The girl said no one had ever told me about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, launched for the first time this year, explains to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes, as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce this course after finding students who were severely deprived of sleep throughout the week.
This one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there was a picture of a dormitory room, where students clicked on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation of the effects of caffeine and lamps, as well as how athletic results were affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep time routines.
In other sections, participants got an explanation as to how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change students' behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have a right to know — just as you have a right to know the effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health,” Prof Czeisler said.
The culture of pride in ‘begging’ still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students which means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you sleep enough, with good quality, should be a ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain activate hunger mode, creating a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California resident who studied chemistry and physical biology who helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize the course for the entire campus.
The next step, she hopes that all graduate students are instructed to complete a similar course of study before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students should consider setting sleep time alarms, also wake alarms, and be aware of the effects of ‘blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its set path causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal lowers Gerrard's team mentality
Again, the Rangers felt the sadness of the away day when Dolly Menga's attack led to Steven Gerrard's team being scattered to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox’s side attempted to record their first win on their way, since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s side had just given Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, causing his side to be eight points behind leaders Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the first half was over and the out of mind Rangers players did not appear to compensate.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, just behind goal difference from Hibernian.
And there could be further problems in the Rangers after line guard Calum Spence had to be treated for head injuries after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Instead, Holt left with the same Livi 11 who took one point from Hearts last week and he would be thrilled with the costumes that wowed their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate possession of the ball, but Livingston makes better use of the ball they have.
They should have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first short pass was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder pulled the big chance too wide.
Keaghan Jacobs's deep free-kick met captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only pierce wide in the back position.
Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than confidence about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have got a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided at the quarter-hour mark but referee Steven Thomson rejected this Colombian appeal.
Rangers only managed to do two pitches in the first half but Ibrox's previous goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, almost never had any problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's easily deflected attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be the opposite of the course of the match, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their own hard work.
Once again Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep dead ball tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet picking Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted on the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the switch was close to having a direct influence as the winger put the ball on Morelos but the impressively played Kelly quickly got off the line for a touchdown.
But Livingston continued to force the away team to play the exact game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping away all the long balls.
Holt's team were supposed to widen their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood well to repel the Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from a corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty when he was at odds with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his back.
Almanac: The Invention of the Geiger Breaker
And now from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and WE WILL STILL BE GIVEN... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, it was an invention that eventually made the device known as the Geiger Breaker.
Being a science mainstay since then, Geiger has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring less convincing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger Breaker, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When wearing these earphones, you can actually hear the effect of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "Say, it must be popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But it was the discovery that kept his name alive.
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to ‘know' evil cells
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'know' evil cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of treatment.
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory
They can then 'recognize' proteins that are common in many cancers and then be injected again
A trial vaccine showed promising results in patients with a wide range of cancers.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves the process of extracting the patient's immune cells, changing them in the laboratory so they can "recognize" the protein commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Society in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "encourages the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as taking a patient's immune cells and "teaching" to them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West Started Diatribe Pro-Trump, Wearing MAGA Hat, After His SNL Appearance.
Doesn't Walk Well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing a third song that night, titled Ghost Town where she wore the Make America Great hat, she challenged the Democratic party and repeated her support for Trump.
“Often I talk to white people and they say: ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Yes, if I'm concerned about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL began the show with a play starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's abuse was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock is trying to make fun of West with the upload.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble backstage due to the hat being worn.
"They're beating me in the back of the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out wearing that hat.'
They're bugging me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see where the sink is?" saying that he's going to wear Superman's cloak, because this means you can't dictate what I have to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments resulted in at least twice the scorn from the audience and the SNL cast looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling: "The whole studio is silent."
West was brought in at the last moment as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, former girlfriend of rapper Mac Miller who had just died a few days ago.
West confuses many with the performance of his song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier Bottle.
West had the support of TPUSA's conservative group chairman Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR BLESSING PEOPLE."
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being himself and that's really very good."
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his shirt or supporting his "art") who I believe embraces and spits out an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "a creature officially known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and later the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword swing in his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, refutes the macho hero’s stereotypes, saying that such roles on screen make teenage boys often feel that they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something was wrong' and questioned how to deal with the problem of poor masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who has just married his co-star in Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted she felt "strong enough" to discuss the issue.
"I feel personally, quite strong, at the moment - where is our fault in terms of this masculinity?," he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?"
Kit believes television may have been responsible for the emergence of poor masculinity with its highly masculine characters.
He continued: 'Which character was born and what was taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they must have this particular side of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions in this time - how do we change it?
There’s something wrong with young people.”
In the interview he also admitted that he will not play in a prequel or a sequel to Game of Thrones when the series is due to end next summer, saying that he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
Since November Kit will star in the return of True West from Sam Shepard, a story about the film's producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best reason to quit Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this show, thus giving me a family of the future, and from here my life begins.”
Rose plays Ygritte, Kit's love interest Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the Leslie family's home ground in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% surge in new cases
China has announced a 14% surge in the number of its population living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking a change from before.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has increased to 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been called increasing.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many transmission of the disease comes from inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that staff had leaked GOP senators' data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
United States. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of her staff members had sent the personal information of three United States Republican Party senators to the Wikipedia page of MPs.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party asserted that the claim was driven by experts and an "ultra-right wing" website.
"Lies, lies, and many more are heinous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It was reported that the information released included the home address and phone number of United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of indecent sexual treatment against future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
This leak appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was connected to Waters' office and uncovered the information of one of Waters' staff members, Hill reported.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and are absolute lies," Waters continued.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information, and safety are threatened by fraudulent and false allegations - are in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' remarks quickly drew online criticism, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This ban means anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows he's not fit to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something that doesn't do it, they shouldn't be angry.
They can't stray.
They can't question the motives of the accused.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who was trying to shift Waters at the half-time election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "proper authorities and law enforcement entities of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their destructive and harmful actions for any and all of my staff members."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Rowan Atkinson's less-than-nice spy parody
It is currently seeking the significance of Brexit in every new film with British biased views already a tradition and it appears to apply to the re-emergence of the Johnny English comedy-drama parody franchise – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the insinuating sarcasm of how clearly bad we are become a new export opportunity for the country?
Anyway, the glaring, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has renewed his license to screw things up for the second time - his name hints more than anything else that he is a vast comic creation designed for areas of language cinema other than English.
Surely he is a mad secret agent who, despite his strange conjecture, has little of Clouseau's character, a piece of Mr Bean's character and a bit of a traveller who contributed little note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Indeed, he is based on the international traveller and mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving a mess behind him.
There are one or two sweet moments on this recent JE trip.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and a rotor propeller quickly stuck to his helmet.
Atkinson's gifts for physical comedy were shown, but the humor felt underpowered and too bizarre, especially when "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible had confidence to include comedy as material.
His humor feels as if it’s aimed at children rather than adults, and to me the odd Johnny English misadventures aren’t as innovative and as focused as Atkinson’s dumb-film jokes in Bean’s personality.
The warm premise of these years is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered the super-secret British spy web network, uncovering the identities of all British agents on the ground, to disappoint the agents on duty – unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This was the last chance for a proud and hostile prime minister, who had already completely destroyed his political popularity: Emma Thompson played a very good role with the quasi-Teresa-May character but there was not much to process from the script.
His intelligent advisers provide information that since every active spy has been weakened, he must bring one out of retirement.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English himself, now employed as principal in some luxury buildings, but gives a secret lesson on how to conduct undercover operations: there are some nice jokes here, when English offers spy academies like the School of Rock.
English is returned to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunites with long-suffering old friend Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, marrying a submarine commander, the role of a top-class woman in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat eliminated.
So Batman and Robin who make a mistake on Her Majesty's Secret Agent are back in action, meeting the mysterious beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister alarmingly falls under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve a British computer problem: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their silly adventure: disguised as servants, they set fire to a French fast food restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury ship; and English sparks anarchy when she tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize herself with the interior of Volta's home.
All stops are certainly drawn to the last sequence, but with such hospitality and fuss, there are few children’s TV channels that contain about everything.
It's a moderate thing.
And like any other Johnny English movie, I can’t help but think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that’s really appropriate for his talent?
Labour denied it was planning for Britons to work four days a week but were paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Union considered a radical plan that wanted Britons to work four days a week - but was paid five days.
The union reportedly wants the company's owners to continue the savings through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution for the workers by giving them extra holidays.
He would let the employees enjoy a three-day weekend – but still get paid the same.
Some sources say that the idea will be 'past' with the party's economic agenda and plans to encourage the country to support the workers.
The transition to four days a week has been approved by the UK Trade Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
A senior source from the Labor Union told The Sunday Times: “A review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
“This will not happen overnight, but the four working days of the week are an aspiration that aligns with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy that supports workers and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party had already promised four working days a week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at present the aspirations are not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘Four working days a week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.’
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to perfect his vision for a socialist revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from ‘anonymous directors' and ‘the cutters' at utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means, current shareholders in the drinking water company probably won't get back his entire share because the government of the Labour party can do a 'reduction' on the grounds of perceived violations.
He also confirmed his plans to put workers on the company’s board and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company’s equity in the private sector to employees, who would pocket annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their view
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to revoke their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could find something that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seems more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to attend the trial, I said I had already spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charge appeared, and said, 'You did it?'
He is strong, determined, firm."
However, it seems that Graham's voice will not be able to be changed.
"My mind has decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but all I know is: Brett denied it strongly," Graham added, while referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he mentions his name can't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has it Done Something to Reduce Poverty?
On this Saturday, New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive array of stars performing, and a memorable mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been for the past 12 years in achieving its goals?
Is the idea of giving a free concert the right way to get people to take action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” – people feel like they’re making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing to set other goals.
It said this action has helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will impact more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had collected 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, at least $10 billion of which had been channeled or raised.
The group estimates safe funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children grow to their fullest potential,” promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make this social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told a crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions in Common Answers on their website asking "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied: “It’s going to be a long and difficult road – sometimes we’re going to fall and fail.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement that existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will get stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the stars performing at this year's event in New York, to be guided by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy as a "blockade" to hamper Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could ask the Navy for help to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspected that Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular, in its place operating at the invitation of a legitimate government - was a pretext for exploring the new energy market.
“I’m sure the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to be energy brokers, just like they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe,” he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that capability, with our Navy, to ensure the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke before the attendees of the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group calling itself the "voice of energy customers" in the US.
He compared the approach Washington took in the deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
"Economic choices in Iran and Russia are more or less, utilizing and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as one of "the experts in that field" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
This statement comes as Trump administration representatives are on a mission to increase their liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 refinery pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a Moscow “captive”.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil refinery project, designed to double the existing pipeline capacity of up to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denied that Washington's fierce opposition to the project was merely driven by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be used as a tool to exert pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US stance has drawn a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the U.S. not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I will face major problems if a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will “Observe the Situation” When She Runs for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "look into the situation" while running for president after a part-time election.
While campaigning at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our dilapidated government, including putting women at the top," she told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will take a closer look at the situation when I run for president.”
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning at the city hall, saying that he "brought the region in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren bluntly delivered his criticism of Trump and future Supreme Court chief Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a poll released on Thursday, showed that most of Warren's own constituents did not want him running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "possible" voters in Massachusetts say it's best for senators not to run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of running and 48 percent opposing him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed in connection with the possibility of running in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD Track Palin during Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in Sept.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my son has experienced, what he will experience when he returns, I can relate to other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers have suffered," he told the audience at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest like an "elephant in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "they came back a little differently, they came back harder, they came back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence offences against a woman, coupled with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenges to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to a new U.S. policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name Grace v. In a session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner "and his son who was a member of a ruthless gang," had harassed him, but U.S. officials rejected his asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors in favor of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced large numbers of asylum applicants for the U.S., as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy contrasts with a 2014 Council of Immigrants appeal decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores state, federal, and international laws that have been around for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims should be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances relating to such claims, and such a ban violates the principle," friend-of-the court briefs he said.
The prosecutor further gave a brief opinion that policies that deny immigrants entry are detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying they are likely to be entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang atrocities.
“Reasons are available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear caused by issues of race, religion, nationality, or membership in certain social groups, or political opinions,” Sessions said in the policy announcement on June 11.
Asylums aren't meant to alleviate all problems -- even though all problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue attempt at Palu as victims multiply while racing with time to find survivors
For those who survived, the situation was getting worse.
"It feels very stressful," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her baby boy who is being held in a refugee center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is very rare."
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up waterlogged items, trying to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, the damage caused by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, was devastating.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken spine and shoulder, were lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to a strong aftershock.
Her tears flowed as she recounted her feelings as the earthquake rocked her fifth-floor hotel room where she was staying with her wife and daughter.
“I didn’t have the chance to save myself.
I think I'm stuck in the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding his family was in the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, and then fell silent.
I don’t know what it is and my son.
May they be safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘intimidating’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. daily calling the reciprocal gains of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred the China Daily paid supplement to the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on Nov. 6, an allegation China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election, which marked what U.S. officials told Reuters, is a new phase in Washington’s increased campaign to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently shackled in a growing trade war, which has led them to raise tariffs on each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa who backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt workers, farmers and business people in America.
China, Branstad wrote an opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubling that intimidation by running propaganda ads in our own free media."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the tradition of free speech and press freedom that is highly valued in America by loading paid ads on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Instead, in the street newspaper sales stalls here, in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and will not see an actual reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China's troubled economic trajectory, given the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent media outlets declined an offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analysts Warn Republicans to Keep Female Voters Ahead of Part-time Election With Kavanaugh Disaster
Due to key Republicans standing up and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash, especially from women, at the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions over the matter are very high, and most Republicans are recorded as already showing that they want to go ahead on the vote.
That cannot be prevented," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake's push at the last minute to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to defuse anger at voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators chanted "November is near!" as they staged a demonstration in the Senate aisle as Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee to continue ahead in Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democracy's enthusiasm and motivation will be off the list," non-party political analyst Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it could be even higher, particularly among female voters in suburban areas and younger voters, 18 to 29, who because they dislike the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony explaining in detail the potential Supreme Court leadership’s sexual abuse of him, analysts advised there would be a backlash following if Republicans continued to push him forward with confirmation.
"It's a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News.
"It's not just about committee elections or final voting or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how Republicans deal with this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helped to vote for the Democratic Party, pointed to a news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided as to who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents actually believe or may believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they actually believe or may believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or actually lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After a push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that drunk Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court candidate showed his penis to him while they were attending a party while they were attending college at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start a New Internet to Face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The tech legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company built from Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, while jokingly Berners-Lee said that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said from the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
This storage can contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about this personal online data storage is that it really is up to the user who can access what type of information.
In a company it is known as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea to set up Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, was to have the company present the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of code-creating volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all of their business models would actually be reversed overnight.
"We didn't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the neutrality of the network debate.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic of the next web age,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorating WW1 scholar Victoria Cross
The only Church cleric in England to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter, commemorated in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "symbol of intelligence" stone that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's achievement winning the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "penetrating a very thick fog under a barrage of fire from field guns and machinery."
Then he rushed forward to the battle line and with the "greatest courage" led the front line before rushing using field guns alone and crippling three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I wouldn't be able to live but it was a very humble act."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to play a part in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being demonstrated with the support that many people will give."
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they get Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this, you’ve been up all night watching the overcrowded Bellator 206 just to be turned down watching the main event.
The San Jose bill contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being aired live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, audiences in England were made stunned when his coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they stay up until the early hours of the day specifically for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the turn to children's cartoons as "an annoying joke."
"It's a government regulation, that at 6 a.m. the content was not suitable for airing, so it was replaced with a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Papa the pig," yes.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would improve their scheduling by taking audiences into account in the UK in the future.
“In my opinion, if we think about replays, I think we might be able to get it done,” Coker said.
"But right now it's six in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the time of the change, there was a lot of text going back and forth and everything was not educational.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government issue.
Trust me, next time it won’t happen again.
We will reduce up to five fights out of six fights – as we usually do – and we will try to avoid over-watching for fans, and we succeed.
This is an unfortunate circumstance."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'low self' about sexuality issues
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with a sense of inferiority due to his sexuality issues - but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize it until he entered high school, that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said, she spoke about the right of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him not so concerned about winning the Olympics.
The host of this long-running show, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as the ones who were knocked out on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "less than" everyone else growing up with her because "it's not socially acceptable to like men and women."
He said: "To this day, that feeling of being less than others, and feeling different, have become the real things that give me the power and strength to succeed."
She wants to prove that she is "something," she says, so she won't let everyone down when they find out about her sexuality issues.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known LGBT campaigner and used her performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
She said she spoke because she felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with a man — US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — "surprised me."
Daley was married to an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him last year, and said the age gap was not a problem.
"When you have so many problems at a very young age" - she followed her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she says it's very difficult to find someone of the same age who is experiencing the same ups and downs.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley saying "his entire perspective" had changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's all about 'I have to win the gold medal'," he said.
“You know, there’s something bigger than winning an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medallion is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had already gotten tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't say to him 'you're not going to sit in the front row of dad'," he said.
“I held her hand when she stopped breathing and still hadn’t really stopped breathing until she died, I finally admitted that she was invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – which had already fused with him in his preparations for the Olympics and still had him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sundays at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changes role when he is slated for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American golfer Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change roles to avoid unpleasant achievements.
Mickelson, who played in the biennial event to set the record for the 12th time, was reserved by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball and four-group game on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as he usually does for the United States, this five-time major winner splits his time between being a cheerleader and doing his game at that range, hoping to fix what has been bothering him.
Never being the most straight golf batsman despite being at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not fit to take a very tight course at Le Golf National, which routinely gives a long, rough penalty for every wrong shot.
And for his own pitch, it wasn’t scary enough for Mickelson, in his ninth game on Sunday, to face highly accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 single games with four points below, starts with a hot start, then Mickelson's game proves to be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understood his role today, patted his back and embraced me, and said he would be ready for tomorrow's game," Furyk said.
"He's so confident.
He is a Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can’t imagine him playing two games.
I imagine everything else, but that’s the way it’s played and that’s the way we think we have to go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most-played Ryder Cup games, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup which would never equal the height of his individual record.
Mickelson bagged 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought some things that couldn't be said to the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's a joke, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players have fun with him, this week as well, which is quite fun to see.
He gives a lot of things, more than just playing.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, learned from experience that someone leading big enough towards his last single game in the Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant ride.
The Dane made his first debut in a 1997 game at Valderrama, with team captain Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point lead over the Americans, but had just touched the finish line with their noses by a slimmest margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get a big advantage at Valderrama; we get a big advantage at Brookline, where we lose, and at Valderrama, where we win, but just now," said Bjorn, taking the picture, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday by a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will enter a really boring game.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that goal is to win this trophy, and that’s the focus.
I’ve said for a long time that I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re also very aware of what’s on the other side – the greatest players in the world.”
It was nice to see the players playing on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "In this case I will never progress myself.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will advance, and this is a different thing that will be done.
It’s great to be out there with a colleague when things are going well, but if you’re out there playing individually, then your full potential as a golfer will be tested.
That’s the message you have to convey to all the players, getting the best out of yourself for tomorrow’s game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his players to play better individually than they did as a yapairann, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of four points.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the last day of the big game, having been part of the team that won at Brookline before ending in defeat as Europe performed the "Miracle at Medina."
“I remember every single word,” he said, answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together for the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you see at Brookline, as you see at Medina.
When the momentum goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in a variety of ways that we feel, you know, we are trying to do wonders tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight against Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European players at the top.
"I went with this group of people in this order because I thought I could close all the way," Bjorn said of his single choice.
Germany's new warship suspended again
The latest German Navy escorts should have begun service in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warship, but it won’t be there at least until next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The assignment of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class escort ship, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-shipping issues have disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships already ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come in place of the old Bremen-class escort ships.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as several stealth technologies, such as radar removers, infrared, and acoustic locks.
Other important features include a longer period of maintenance - it should have been possible to use the latest escort ship for two years away from its home port.
The constant delay, however, meant this sophisticated warship – which was said to allow the Germans to accentuate its power abroad – would be obsolete by the time it began to enter its term of duty, Die Zeit noted.
The ill-fated F125 escort was reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Few reasons are known behind the ship's return, but German media cited an important amount of "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless if used for combat missions.
Software defects were crucial because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the manpower on the older Bremen-class battleships.
It was also discovered that the ship's weight was extremely excessive which would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
This 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the ship of a similar class that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of production of the entire project - including the training of crew members - was also a problem.
It said it rose surprisingly to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from its initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The issue that shackled the new escort ship became especially important given the latest warnings due to the depreciation of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of Germany's parliament's defense committee admitted that the Navy was actually "out of ships with the ability to deploy."
The official said over time the problem was growing, as the old ships were no longer in use but no replacement ships were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class escort ships could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret lives of bats in secret
New research is being done on an estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to uncover how bats use landscapes in their food hunt.
It is expected that these findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common pipistrelle and soprano and long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Sound experts who analyze all recordings will ensure the frequency of bat calls and which species performs what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be created to create images with detailed landscape scales about their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation advisor for NTS, hopes these results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits are gained from habitat management work such as grassland creation and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and across England has declined sharply in recent centuries.
These bats are threatened by development and development work that affects the nest and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper suspended to trap bats as well as chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
In fact, the bat is not blind.
However, due to his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo location techniques to find insects precisely and barriers in their flying paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is deeply concerned about bats.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, nest checks, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organization has also established the first and only nature reserve in Scotland on the Thrave estates at Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
Farm manager David Thompson said the estate was a suitable area for bats.
"Here at Threave, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
However, there's still a lot we don't know about bats yet, so, the work we do here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of checking bats before carrying out maintenance within the property, as unwittingly there is a possibility that the destruction of one maternity nest could kill up to 400 female bats and a small one, which would probably wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and kill, harass, or disturb, or destroy their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the general public to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species that we don’t yet know how their populations are going.”
Ronaldo, who rejected the rape claim, is preparing a lawyer to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claims against him “fake news,” and said people “wanted to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers would sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was later alleged to have paid him by giving $375,000 to keep his word of mouth regarding this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They wanted to be famous by saying my name, but it was part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel on the charges, which they have called "an unacceptable report of suspicion in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said it would ask for compensation as "a moral compensation in an amount corresponding to the weight of the offence, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident was said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he is alleged to have raped her, according to a report filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo was on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good guy" who disappointed only "one percent."
Documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but that was on the basis of mutual desire.
Mayorga also said he went to the police station and had visumed his injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to settle the matter out of court because he felt "fear of getting revenge" and feared "would be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old said she was now trying to cancel the peace settlement as she was constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever’ over carmakers' loss
Britain “will regret it forever” if it loses its status as a world leader as a carmaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added "about" Toyota, Britain had told the BBC that if Britain exited the European Union without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of a border delay if there is no deal would be detrimental to Brexit in terms of job costs.
The factory in Burnaston – which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis production – produced nearly 150,000 cars in the past year that were 90% exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will see a halt to production at our plant," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other British automakers have expressed concerns about their exit from the European Union with no agreement on how cross-border trade will run, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem related to what the automakers say is the risk of the supply chain if there is no deal with Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on the principle of “on time” production, with parts coming in every 37 minutes both from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If Britain leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there may be disruptions at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at its Derbyshire plant, the company's representative said, and thus production would be halted.
Clark said Chequers Theresa May's plans for future ties with the European Union were "appropriately calibrated to avoid border checks."
"We have to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say to not only enjoy success at this moment, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence is not just from Toyota alone but other manufacturers as well, that we really need to be able to continue what is already a supply chain that has gone very well.”
Toyota could not say how long its production would be halted, but that is clear in the long run, warning that adding costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and would ultimately be detrimental in terms of job costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union manager of Unite at the factory, said his members were already increasingly worried: "In my experience, once this job is off, it will never come back again.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward an appropriate and reasonable plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed back in a week” as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, relations among Trump’s aides and Russia, as well as potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has sparked rumours in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed using telegrams to record conversations with Trump and possibly oust the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was again postponed to avoid clashes with a Senate judicial committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's one-week investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting has not yet been set, it could be in this week, I can see that resuming it to another week is good also given the other things that happened in the Supreme Court.
But let's just look at it and I always want to deliver the latest news to the press."
Several reporters will oppose the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the infrequent meeting was not due to dislike for TV reporters "who are trying to attract attention," though, he said: "I disagree with the fact that they are trying to attract attention."
Then he proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The president did more direct question and answer sessions than the previous president," he added without mentioning any evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting will still take place, Sanders said, however "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it more often and you’ve seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump routinely asks questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting high-ranking officials.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president will probably show why, performing free and sometimes bizarre performances before the reporters get together.
Health secretary writes letter to European Union workers at NHS Scotland on concerns over Brexit issues
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and hopes they will still work here after the Brexit issue.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed to meeting the cost of filing a permanent status for EU citizens working in the transferred public services.
In a letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on this withdrawal are still ongoing, approaching the decision expected this fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for a possible scenario of a no-deal.
I know this must be very disturbing for all of you.
That is why now I want to reaffirm how much I appreciate the contribution of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union, and others, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and enhance healthcare work, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of the Tennesse reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the round was over.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell unconscious there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave oxygen to Abercrombie on the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further evaluation.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was already out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there has been no detail about the type/level of injury experienced" and the State of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this red-shirted sophomore, was in his first season with the State of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He got a total of five tackles on Saturday before coming out of the game, which put his total tackle during the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher deadlock when they buy a property in the UK, along with additional money to be used to help the homeless as per the new Tory plan.
This move will contain the pace of success of Corbyn's movement in attracting young voters
This increase in stamping fees will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury Department expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year- to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK – along with additional money to be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This move will be seen as an attempt to stifle the pace of success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts in attracting young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high incomes.
The increase in stamping costs will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, along with additional money that drives the Government's efforts to combat vagrants.
The additional costs – which are additional costs on current stamping fees, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second home purchases and home purchases for rent – could be up to three percent.
The Treasury Department expects this move to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London were purchased by non-British residents, which led to a price increase and made it increasingly difficult for the first buyer to set his foot on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's rich areas - usually in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a week after Boris Johnson called for a slash in stamping costs to help more young people own their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to ignore quotas for affordable homes to fix the UK’s “residential disgrace.”
Corbyn has announced a series of proposed reforms in the area of attractive housing, including rent oversight and ending evictions "without guilt".
He also wanted to empower the council to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I promised I would dedicate the post of prime minister to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our dilapidated housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not the right thing for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, to buy a home as easily as a hard-working UK resident.
For many people the dream of owning a home becomes something very distant, and the indecent treatment of the homeless remains real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scottish team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "main ambition" was to become Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who are currently third in League One, three points clear of the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to defend my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and often watched the Scottish team at Hampden with my father as a child, and it has always been something that attracted me to come back.
However, that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland's managers before Ross include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of big names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, there is no doubt about being in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to be there, but I’ll probably just see myself as a successful person here, if I can bring this club back there.”
Ross's career in team management was only three years, after some time as an assistant boss at Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coaching staff at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to third, and turned St Mirren from the relegation gap into a Championship title winner the following season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"This may be the crossroads I have to go through," he recalls as he took over Alloa.
"I'm absolutely convinced management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I’m fine, making a living in a reasonable way, and enjoying some reasonable things.
But playing can be difficult.
You have a lot to go through each week.
I still experience it in terms of work pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I’ve always wanted to lead something and now I’m doing it, the most comfortable feeling I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The survey found that the right time to drink beer is 17:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted the revenue of pubs in the UK struggling to survive, but has put more pressure on the restaurant network.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July — but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business consultant, who compiled the figures, said: “The blazing sun and England’s participation in the World Cup longer than expected mean, July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where pub revenue increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that get a hard hit.
The decline in restaurant trade by 1.8 percent in June will worsen in July.
Sales of pubs and bars that sell drinks are by far the strongest compared to those of restaurants that go down.
Pubs that sell food also suffer from the heat of the sun, although not as bad as restaurant operators.
Looks like people are just out for a drink.
Sales across well-managed pubs and bars selling drinks rose 6.6 percent for the month, with that selling food down 3%."
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors regarding the sale of markets outside the home.
It is not surprising that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales year-on-year would be particularly painful on top of the ongoing cost pressures.
“A long summer shouldn’t come at a time when operators selling food are having bad times, and time will tell if the good enough temperatures we’ve enjoyed in August will give us the little break it needs.”
Total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a slowdown in the brand launch.

One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey revealed that one in five children — some of whom are still 11 years old — have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the development of the "False Insta" page
This news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "primary" account to show to parents
One in five children — some of whom are still 11 years old — create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid development of a "fake Instagram" account - a reference to a photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they operated a “primary” account that had already been cleared to be shown to parents, while also having a personal account.
A mother who discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who asked others to "rape me."
Research conducted by the British Digital Awareness and Men's Principal Conference" as well as Women's Principals" (HMC) from independent schools, found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep personal accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing so many teenage children are trying to create online spaces that parents and their teachers cannot find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletic board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of stewards.
Doyle is Scotland’s most highly regarded track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from his various international experiences over the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England and the world athletic community and we believe athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing her on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for the athletes and I hope to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American athletics athlete, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC expert, is now unable to walk after experiencing a momentary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “Today a month ago I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said only time can determine if I can recover and to what extent.
It’s a very tiring job to recover fully, relearn how to walk, and today do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ads comparing mothers to cows have split opinion in the online world
Breast pump companies have split opinion in the online world with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the world's first "silently wearable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an advertisement inspired by a joke music video to show the freedom this new pump gives to express a mother.
Four moms danced in a barn full of cow straw following a song that included lyrics like this: "Yes, I blushed myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you don't notice it this isn't a cleft, this is my breast."
Continued with the refrain: "Pump out, pump out, I feed them dear, pump out, pump out, I milk my woman."
However, the ads that have been published on the company’s Facebook page, have caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it is making a "horror" in the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows should also get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless the baby is stolen from them within a few days of giving birth.”

Another comment: “Understandable trauma is good for both mother and baby.
But yes why not use it to advertise a breast pump for the mother who has to take care of the baby?"
Another added: "An ad is missing meaning."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "funny."
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still breastfeeding.
It makes me feel like a cow.
The ads are a bit crazy but I accept them as they are.
It's a genius product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who squeeze (often at their workplaces or toilets) and who feel like "cow."
It's not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all feel dancing with a hidden pump tucked inside their bra.
The basis of this campaign concept comes from the insights of many women who squeeze breast milk who say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes and fits inside the lactating bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while squeezing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is a pioneering product worthy of a convincing and provocative launch.
By equating the picture between expressing women and dairy cows we want to pump breast milk and all its challenges, and show it in an entertaining and fun way with the full freedom presented by the new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie pumps made headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother with two children performed on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Move Silently to Tent at Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children is increasing despite monthly border crossings remaining unchanged, partly as a result of harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that complicate childcare with sponsorship.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and fear jeopardizing their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to save children.
The risk escalated in June, when the federal government announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to hand over fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor displaced minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who sponsor or are members of a sponsoring society are in this country illegally, and most of them are evil foreigners.
“We’re going to go after these people,” said Mr. Albence.
Aiming to process children faster, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, not after 60 days, which had been the standard for shelter workers.
Most of them appear via video conference calls, not direct, to plead their legal status case to immigration judges.
Those who do not deserve help will be deported immediately.
The longer children are being held, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or escape attempts, shelter workers said and system reports received in recent months.
Lawyers say the concern is rising in larger facilities such as Tornillo, whose signs of a struggling child tend to be ignored, due to its size.
They say that moving children to the camp town without providing enough time for them emotionally or saying goodbye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma that has been fought for.
Syria asks 'occupied forces' from the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country’s war has now entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces occupied Syrian soil illegally, on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with appropriately."
"They should withdraw as soon as possible and without filing any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem asserted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than millions fleeing their homes.
He asserted that Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory” of terror groups and “the presence of illegal foreign armies.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, particularly training and influencing Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem insisted they should return soon, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading overwhelming fears" that pushed the refugees further away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a full-fledged humanitarian problem.”
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction assistance for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition was agreed to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has resulted in an opportunity to resume political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive strike from Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where there are three million people living.
However, Moualem asserted that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action would target the mujahid including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "would be sacked."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly call the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to create a post-war Act for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, asserting that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the current articles of the Act," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to the logic, Trump will win another general election in 2020 unless, as many liberal audiences hope, prosecution and scandals end his presidency early.
No one doubts, "The most dramatic presidential end ever!"
To date, there are no signs of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's main hourly ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primetime viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the cable TV rankings with 3.5 million viewers on the night of the headlines.
“This is a spirit that attracts people because of something that is not yet understood,” said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama “Designated Survivor,” about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths In Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He was recalled to take a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he would give Trump his vote.
Why? he asked.
“She said, ‘Because she made me laugh,’” Miss Scovell told me.
There is a sense of entertainment in the chaos.
Certainly, unlike other TV shows, Washington’s emerging storyline could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and restore the global economy.
Moving away from it, the luxury that only the most privileged audience can feel.
However, not just being a knowledgeable citizen at six o’clock you find yourself watching a panel of experts debate the use of Bob Woodward’s “background” source for his book “Fear,” wearing Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather bomber jacket (“thick dress with arrogance,” The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’ horrible description of Trump’s anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario the same again.
"Part of the policy he's made makes it just like a reality show that entertains you every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about the show's cast and Trump's daily storyline (choosing hostile to the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

He was unable to free himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh being prepared to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and subsequently the Supreme Court according to his balance.
"I remember when we had all the crazy shows that day and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it's a joke, but it turns out they're right."

A lot of money from outside flooded the White House's toughest half-time election competition.
It is only natural that Pennsylvania 17 obtained a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of a congressional district that thrust two incumbents in the same seat struggle.
The recently reorganized district of Pittsburg, filed for Conor Lamb from Rep. Democrat - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb advanced against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's old district 12, which overlaps with Pennsylvania's new district of 17.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally siding with the Republican party.
Competition in Pennsylvania's new district 17 has resulted in large campaign funds between the financial side of the major party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a slim victory in a March special election monitored by the public for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been occupied by Republican officials for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians are sending the Democratic Party a little higher.
U.S. weighs El Salvador's penalty for supporting China, then retreats
Diplomats confirmed that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to pull back the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a department spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which had received about $140 million in aid from the Americans in 2017, including for narcotics control, development support and the economy.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, will hurt the Central American country and rising unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meeting took place, North and Central American officials delayed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on the same meeting last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top government officials confirmed that they wanted the conference to continue, in order to effectively end sentencing considerations for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the government's import at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned again to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing a new rebuke or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations on the unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by outside analysts close to the government and also spoke of these unclear circumstances.
Study Stories
Another shocking story is Robert Mueller’s special counsel’s report on Mr Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, which currently has very important evidence in the public record.
Mr Mueller's report also discussed his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in attacking our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable from him, just as he prepares to go again in front of the voters, and may eventually become a jury of his partners.
So much remains to be done, and I don’t mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump’s administration is unavoidable – or its equality in Europe.
There are choices we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed opportunities in avoiding the years of massacres that followed.
The beginnings of history centred along such a point of deviation, and an accelerated or postponed march of democracy was inevitable.
Now Americans are facing some point of change.
What should we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since the paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and argued that he did not deserve to be president.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times account is not true.
“How do we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested F.B.I. investigation is incomplete or fair — or if he is brought before the Supreme Court despite strong allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, will we vote at half-time for Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will get worse in the long run.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once housed my embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on a table that read swastika.
By leaving that legacy to me, how do I lose hope about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, armed with a win over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury left midfielder Graham Dorrans unable to perform in the first season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can capitalize on the result as a stepping stone to a bigger deal.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal are a great team," the 31-year-old said.
"In this game we are sure we can get something and go with one point.
In the end, we might be able to do it but, in our opinion, a draw might be a fair result.
In the first half, they may have done better but in the second half, we got up and became a better team.
Going on a Thursday, tonight is another big European day.
We hope to bag three points even though it will be a difficult game because they have a good result in their last game, but, with the support of the supporters behind us, I am sure we can go ahead and get a positive result.
In the last year, we had a difficult time, because of what happened as a result of my injury and the change at the club itself but right now there is a very good hope at this club.
The squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's a good exercise.
Hopefully now we can grow, put the past behind us and achieve success.”
She couldn’t sleep because she was afraid of her retirement savings.
Although it turns out that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be treated, only not many people discuss it with their family members.
Approximately half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent of them said they were talking about it with their children.
“They want family members to provide care, but there is no way to start the discussion,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
This is where it's time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your own family for treatment if you don’t tell them what you want.
Discuss with your counselor and your family, where and how you get treatment, because the one you choose will be very important in determining the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can certainly give you his or her help in showing you how to pay for those costs.
The financing you choose for long-term care includes a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these costs or insures yourself with your wealth – as long as you have the money.
Show your valid documents: Face the legal debate that looms.
Show immediate power to your health care, i.e. someone you trust to ensure your health care and guarantee if your wishes are carried out by people who are professionals when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, a power of attorney when it comes to your finances should also be considered.
Someone who is trusted to take care of all your financial decisions should you choose, other than to ensure your bill payment in case you can’t afford it.
Always remember with every little detail: Just imagine when your elderly parents are in an emergency health condition and on their way to the hospital.
Will you answer any questions about treatment or allergies?
Write down such details so you are ready to answer.

A man was shot in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind gun on his way home from a night party.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shots hit her chest, stomach, and hands.
The shooting event was described by officers as occurring around 02:30 BST, and was said to be a "random act."
The victim did not see who attacked him.
The injuries sustained by the victim were not life-threatening and a number of witnesses have been filed by police.
Earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia
An earthquake and tsunami so devastating that it hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, has claimed at least 384 lives, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The loss of communication has left aid workers struggling to get information from Donggala County, a region north of the city of Palu that is closer to the epicenter that hit with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are a number of key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the narrow end of the bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a district of more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
This county, which is an administrative region under the province, was estimated to have 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
The mainstay of the economy in South Sulawesi province is fishing and growing, especially on the coast of Donggala.
However, the existence of nickel mining plays an important role in the province, although most of it is centered in Morowali, across the coast of Sulawesi.
Noted in the last 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit by the tsunami several times, based on data from Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in the tsunami disaster and hundreds of homes in Donggala collapsed.
In 1996, nine people died in the tsunami disaster in western Donggala.
Seismicly, Indonesia lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire and therefore earthquakes will occur regularly.
A number of major earthquakes and tsunamis that have struck in recent years are as follows:
2004: 26 December, Indonesia was hit by a major earthquake, precisely on the west coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, to the point of eliminating 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of the death toll was in Aceh.
2005: Late in March and early in April, a series of powerful earthquakes have also hit the west coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
The death toll was more than 1,100.
2010: One of the islands of the Mentawai archipelago, off Sumatra, was also hit by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that instantly devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya district, Aceh, also suffered a shallow earthquake and resulted in destruction, as well as panic from people who were reminded of the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
Although this time there was no potential tsunami, more than 100 people died due to the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, dubbed a tourist island, also suffered a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, most of whom were on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily displaced thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, a former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on the pretext of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing domestic violence reports and countering arrest attempts, as the Alaska State Police report released on Saturday.
According to police reports, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she stole the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over at Mat-Su Pretrial Detention, with an unsecured $500 fine, as reported by KTUU.
As the news network reported, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring herself "innocent, as certain" when asked about her defense.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could have him subject to a one-year prison sentence and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he was also charged with Class B criminal charges, with a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
For Palin, this is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her own mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to make a report on the alleged assault.
The case is currently filed with the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violent crimes, and possession of a firearm in a drunken state, which was also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin came under fire from a veteran group for attributing her son's violent behavior to PTSD as a result of her duties in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of victims die
On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a massive earthquake, killing at least 384 people.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale that has the potential to trigger a tsunami has devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity grids and communications connections have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to continue to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake hit central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing how devastating the moment of the disaster was circulated widely through social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when a tsunami broke the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for terror attack suspect in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- the sentence is rare and has not been carried out in the state in connection with federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly committed an assault by crashing a truck he rented from the Home Depot into pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors had to provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, based on a statement of will to impose the death penalty, which was filed with the Southern District of New York.
Based on court documents, the two charges make it possible to be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of manslaughter in the conduct of extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and attempted motor vehicle destruction.
According to the prosecution, the attack required "substantial planning and early maturation," as a picture of Saipov's crimes committed with "heinous, cruel, and savage."
It was revealed in a statement of will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has resulted in injury, harm, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims in the incident were Argentine tourists.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York handed down the death penalty last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, a defendant in the murder of two drug suppliers, was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The execution of the death penalty last time in New York federal court in 1953, was handed down on the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple found guilty in an espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbekistan origin, showed no remorse as the day and month following the attack.
When asked by investigators, he said he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov also told authorities that the attack was inspired by a video of ISIS being watched from his phone, as the indictment says.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges laid against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, expressed "clear disappointment" at the prosecutor's decision.
"In our opinion, the decision to execute the death rather than accepting a guilty plea for life imprisonment without bail of release will only prolong the trauma of those involved in the incident," Patton said.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had pleaded with prosecutors not to sentence him to death.
Nigel Farage is responsible for Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for 'moving the people's army' today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics — because one of the lawmakers, Theresa May, suggested taking part in negotiations with the EU.
Supporters of the conservative group, Peter Bone, told street action in Birmingham that Britain "should be out" by now if only Farage had served as Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenge May faces in reconciling her divided position has been underscored by supporters of Remain Tories who joined the separate protests denouncing Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan to stay on track despite the attacks on Brexiteers, Remainers and the European Union.
Allied nations stressed that he would be pushed forward to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite a bad backlash - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between his proposed package and 'chaos'.
Bone told the crowd Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to 'put away the Chequers.
His proposal, that Farage should appoint a partner to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
“If the responsibility remains him, we’ll be out by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MPs added: “I am ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers.”
He said, while pointing out his opposition to the European Union: "We are not fighting in a world war to be submissive.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed the proposal that public opinion had the potential to cause changes since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the thinking of the British people has changed and wants a fixed condition, that's not at all true."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in the mass action, told reporters: “Simply put, I want to say: O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers are not popular with the general public, whereas the Opposition will not vote for them, because it is unpopular with our party and activists who are seriously taking to the streets and getting us elected in first place.
Our plea, get rid of the Chequers and start listening to us.’
In a message addressed to May, she added: "The Prime Minister retains their jobs when their promises are fulfilled."
Farage said that political demonstrations must be staged in order to 'feel the heat' if they want to renegotiate the 2016 referendum decision.
“At the moment what is most valuable is the trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to deny Brexit and this is where we are today, affirming to them that ‘we will not let you do that’.”
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I want you to make our political class, who are preparing to deny Brexit, feel the heat.
‘We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who will win us in Brexit and will never give up until an independent, self-governing, and proud United Kingdom is realized.'
Meanwhile, a crowd of Remainers moved through Birmingham before holding an action in the city centre for two hours.
Activists appear to be waving the Tories Against Brexit banner after sparking his line-up this weekend.
A colleague in the Labour ranks, Lord Adonis, made fun of the Conservatives over their party's application security issues as the conference opened.
‘It is these people who tell us that they can master the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the sake of an anti-friction border, in the wake of unlimited free trade in Ireland.’
“It’s a funny show.
There is absolutely no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to make 'serious crash' in presidential run-off
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "swim the presidential nomination" after the moment of the election in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic party declared its future at a city hall in western Massachusetts, on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently denounces President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, Trump's 2016 vice-chairman of the campaign in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was already marked as an opponent of Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, held in the format of the city hall since Trump took office.
A participant asked him if there was any plan to run for president.
Warren replied that this was the right time “for women to enter the Washington circle to restore our broken government, and that includes the time for women to topple.”
The shooting of Sims, an LSU player.
On Saturday, the Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced the arrest of a suspected shooter leading to the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. in an ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, in which a man was identified asking for help as seen in the footage.
Friday morning, Sims, 20, was shot and found dead near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde wanted to protect his friend and Simpson opened fire on him.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, holding a firearm, and firing it at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any meaningful resistance and thrown into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player 6 feet 6 inches tall, growing up in Baton Rouge, that’s the figure of Sims, having played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team concedes victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear at a time when Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in a qualifying event on Saturday that would carry orders the Mercedes team had a big role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton as he maintained his position in the turn two first and drew Vettel to attack his team-mates.
Vettel became the first to drive into the pits and allowed Hamilton to move in density at the end of the crowd, something that should have been very decisive.
Mercedes entered the pits one lap later and exited after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to drive after several chases that showed the Ferrari driver's reluctance to leave the inside empty with the risk of holding out after a double move to hold on in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead on most of the race as he held off a tyre change to target a quick finish and took over Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He ended up getting into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to improve his pace on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen eventually took fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who let me.
The team has done an incredible job of having one or two," Hamilton said.
That's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday through her insistence, she did not divulge a letter from Christine Blasey Ford on allegations of sexual assault against future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on what was going on in the senate showing people who were "evil and perverted and dishonest."
"Something that can happen and the wonderful things that have happened over the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and mean and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at the leaks and leaks, then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't divulge it."
All right, wait a minute.
What we're leaking...No, we're not leaking it," he added, as the senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and it had leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak did not come from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's allegations, I'm not leaking his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as secret as he requested."
But his refusal was apparently disapproved by the president, who commented during a rally on Saturday night: "I'm going to tell you, it's really a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the future Supreme Court Justice, who became accused of sexual abuse of three women, the president was impressed to suggest Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power in various ways.
“You see crime, ignorance, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to walk for power and surveillance,” Mediaite said in a statement.
Liga Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 home game on Saturday.
The Giants got a two-goal lead after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side balanced before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their win.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season experienced by Adam Keefe's men, who managed to catch up on the slack and eventually outperformed to be able to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants' three wins in the previous game.
The opener from Dwyer came in in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a pass given by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving a pass when Beauvillier managed to double the lead four minutes later.
In a solid opening period, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the feeder for the counterweight Cownie did at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead in the first half when netting his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The home side reunited and Bouchard once again balanced their position with a power play goal at a time of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee a lead for the first time at the end of the game in the second period and he secured a victory with his side in the middle of the fifth during the final period.
The Giants, who to date have suffered four defeats from their five games, are at home to face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Driver Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers on Plane Survive from Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after his death while ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others disappeared after a major earthquake struck the Sulawesi archipelago on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks have continuously rocked the region and many are trapped in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his comrades fleeing for their safety, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in a violently shaken guide tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport, Palu.
He chose to hold out to ensure Flight Batik Air number 6321, which at the time was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic guide tower as he felt the tower was beginning to collapse.
He died afterwards in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Indonesia’s Aviation Navigation Service, said his decision could save hundreds of lives, ABC Australia reported.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter made it to the Palu.
“We are all sad to hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the National Disaster Management Agency delivered access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong difficult.
"The casualties are believed to still continue to grow as many bodies of victims are still overrun by the rubble and many others are unreachable," said national disaster management spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching six meters have left Palu muddied which led to a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carried aid and various supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
Clean water is rare.
Minimarkets everywhere looted"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It has become a tragedy, but it may get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia earlier this year was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one person missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operated a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia saying one person had disappeared, having previously delivered to 47 passengers and crew having been evacuated safely from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a Saturday afternoon release that it could not identify a male passenger.
The airline said it had been working with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detail about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said the remaining six passengers were in hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the complete sequence of events is still unclear.
The U.S. airline and navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon around the runway.
Some witnesses felt the plane was beyond the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
“That’s really good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to wade through waist-high water through the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He delivered the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a slight head wound.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working close around the repaired dock also helped rescue using rubber boats to transport people ashore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in a PNG-registered airline crash over the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Analysts reveal the timeline of a woman's night burned alive
The prosecution of the case took place on Saturday in a re-examination of a man accused of arson against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
She drew an outline for the judges on how she used cell phone footage to collect the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the eve of her death.
Rowlett said she received location data from multiple mobile phones that showed Tellis was at one location with Chambers on the night of her death, in contrast to the defendant's previous statement, Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed the accused's cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police finally asked Sanford for an explanation.
Sanford attended the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency delivered by Tellis was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate they know each other within a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, sometimes Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He removed the victim from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would lead to a jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of hip hop trio wanted to challenge the genre's negative views by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who hails from Bristol, claims the hip hop movement moved away from the origin of political messages and rammed into social issues.
They want to get back to its roots and make hip hop spirit popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK through several artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
NY nanny sues couple for assault after issuing "racialist" messages
A New York nanny sued one couple for discriminatory assault after receiving an indirect message from a complaining mother and declaring she was "another black man."
The couple rejected that they were considered racist, and considered it more like "rape."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her anxiety when she realized that her new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"THE OTHER BLACK PEOPLE," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
After all, instead of sending it to her husband, she instead sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, stating that they took out a nanny, who was a mixed African-American, because he had done a bad job and he was more expecting Filipinos, based on the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home using Uber.
Maurice is now demanding that the couple be compensated for the dismissal, and is seeking compensation of about $350 a day for a period of six months, in return for the nanny work he initially had to work on, even without a contract.
"I wanted to show them, look, you can't do anything like that," he told the Post on Sunday, then added "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple countered claims that they were racist, saying the worker Maurice fired was a reasonable thing to do, fearing they could not believe him after offending him.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
“But can you let your children be taken care of by someone you’ve been married to, even if it’s just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As wrapped up in "hardening," Plasco said his wife had just two months to give birth to her baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone who's in such a condition?
That’s not a good thing to do,” the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has made quick denunciations of the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitude and logic.
Paddington publishers worry readers won't be in touch with talking bears, new newspaper revealed
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after her book had been received, explained in the letter. "It's very difficult to just talk without knowing the position she's in, reading it first before it's published.
It's funny to know as we know about Paddington's great success."
Saying his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through the writing of a children's book with bear toys, was very optimistic about his work having been rejected, he added the 60th anniversary of the book's publication that was deemed "sweet bitterness" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father was quite proud of the end of his success.
"He is a fairly quiet man, and he is not a proud man," he said.
“But because Paddington means so much to him, it’s like you have a child who has achieved something: you’re proud of them even though not all of your efforts.
I think he looked at Paddington's success like that.
Even though it was the result of his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her over the phone.
On landing, her daughter was immediately taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors failed to rescue her.
"Nad made a quiet call to convey it was so bad that he was most likely not going to survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying he would die within the next two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors had given to keep his heart from beating slowly ran out and left his system.
He had died while the handling process was going on and everything felt deadly.
I can just sit there and wait, understanding all this has been revealed.
I couldn’t moan, or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold on to it all."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers – unaware of what she had gone through.
“No one knows,” he said.
“My head was lethargic and my tears continued to drip all the time.
It was very difficult to explain, but during that flight I felt so deep sympathy for Nad.
He needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
Women in mourning post cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who lost a loved one are trying to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be reached for support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that his smile brightens the atmosphere."
But, she stopped working before she died, like she was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that there will be a sustained effect."
Mrs. Davis made the cards, "to tell people that there are other people out there that you can approach and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who was friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he was feeling sad or depressed or whatever," she said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their presents he didn’t look into their eyes or anything.”
He said his death was a major trauma for them, but they had to go through it: "It made a gap in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to get through it and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in uncertainty when the FBI begins its investigation
"I think if we really get something like what he's asking for - a time-limited investigation, limited in scope - we might be able to bring a bit of unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "destroyed" amid a deadlock in the board's ruling.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their rejection of everything is due to time.
Legislative elections are five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans do poorly, they will become very weak in its chance to get the person they want elected to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush had contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It remains unclear if Mr Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes among the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors ‘fall' under Kim
The number of people defecting from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern unification ministry data, said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by people smugglers were a key factor.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
Most defectors from the North were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 people from North Korea had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them back.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in the war - have greatly increased in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on pending denuclearization negotiations.
This comes after a historic meeting in June between US presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of development since.
"Without trust in the United States, there would be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, there is no way we would have dropped our arms unilaterally," Mr Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical," saying he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Opposition Party chairman Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical" and said she was not temperamentally fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I cannot avoid the thought that if a woman performs like that, they will say ‘hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that she had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times almost screaming and having trouble talking when discussing about his family and his years during high school.
He also blatantly condemned Democrats on the committee, saying the charges against him were "unreasonable and coordinated character killings" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi expressed objections if he would try to prosecute if he was approved, and if Democrats gained more votes in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit not just to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he as a Democrat he was concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's ruling against the Health Services Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was seen as a conservative justice theorist.
In the appointment hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for someone who is hysterical and biased to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to handle it.
It was an ethical slur, a rage for months and years, and he couldn’t get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry, Miss Steinem said to me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s weird, what do you think?”
He continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person who was talking to her, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he continued.
And I think it's brilliant."
Tears were issued as a way out of anger partly because he was essentially misunderstood.
One of the most powerful memories of my early work, in a male-dominated office, one time I cried with unexpressed anger, was that my throat was gripped by an older woman — a cold manager I had always been a bit afraid of — who dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she tells me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, understood that there was no reason for him to run for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called her "The Snow Princess and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was too late in the campaign, he was left behind in fundraising, and so he vowed he would not contest the election unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a fight that led to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to the man only gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
As he made a speech announcing that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was too overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism – made it difficult to speak out.
"You'd probably think that I'm too nervous," Ms. Schroeder recalled of how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think that Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write on my headstone?
"Is he crying?"
How U.S.-China trade rivalry might be good for Beijing
The opening shot of the trade rivalry between the U.S. and China is so deafening, and while the fight is still far from over, the rift between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, fired the first anniversary earlier this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese export goods including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
A very significant increase was imposed starting this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion dollars (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, effectively imposing a tax on half of all goods entering the U.S. through China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, recently imposing tariffs to five to ten percent on $60 billion in American goods.
China has pleaded to equal the U.S. one-by-one, and the world's second-largest economy will not change anytime soon.
Asking Washington to step down means following a will, but publicly relenting to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards appropriately, the pressure of U.S. trade competition could support China positively in the long run by reducing dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision by Washington or Beijing can make conditions triggering economic movements in both countries is actually more dangerous than what observers have known before,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and offers help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government went on to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore them as they were.
All conditions are now present due to the voluntary return of refugees to the country they must leave because of terrorism and the comprehensive economic decisions that make their daily lives and livelihoods a target.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled Syria since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive assistance or conditional assistance from countries that support the insurgency.
Europe confirms Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup defeating Team USA by the finals of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its cup when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who attempted almost throughout the tournament, hit his tee shot into the water on the 16th par-3 hole, conceding his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone throughout his round, being 1 of 4 players to have scored 5-0-0 since the prevailing format of the tournament began in 1979.
American athlete Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest-placed player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top order player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
A Ryder Cup eight veteran, Sergio Garcia of Spain became European with an overall win with 25.5 career points at this tournament.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stand it today.
It's been a difficult year.
Thank you very much Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I can help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He gave his responsibilities to compatriot John Ram who defeated legendary U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
“The amazing pride I felt, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record of Ryder Cup career.
Strange statistics by one of the best players of all time, have won 14 major titles just under Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to gain a fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fight.
There was a time this morning when we were making it difficult for Europe.
We had a fight.
Respect for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to restructure, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to step forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to pay your respects.
We lost the upper hand."
