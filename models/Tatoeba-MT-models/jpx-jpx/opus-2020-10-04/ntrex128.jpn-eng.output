Senator Welsh (AM) for shame.
The idea that we should change the name of Congress Congressman's name from AM to MWP (Assembly MS) is spreading confusion among some of them.
The start of the plan to change the name of the Welsh Congress.
The legislature of every member party is concerned that this can lead to a stupid situation.
One working party member is concerned about having "Twp" and "Pwp" rhymmed inside the party.
For non-Welth readers, Twp in Welsh means "cracked," and Pwp means "dung".
One senator of the Party's Pride Kunri said that the whole party suggested alternatives to being “unsatisfied”:
A congressman of the Welsh Conservatives said that the party is "open" to change their name, but it's not much different from the sound of MWP and Manuke (muppet).
By the way, the sound of the Welsh word "w" is similar to the English accent of Yorkshire.
"The final decision regarding the name of the legislature is to be entrusted to the legislature himself without saying," said the councilman in charge of the current drafting of a renamed change.
By the rule of Wales in 2017, the Welsh Parliament has been authorized to change its name.
In June it became clear that the committee was greatly admired by Assembly for renamed the parliament to the Welsh legislature, and released the results of civil consultation on the proposal.
In the name of the legislature, the committee backed up the idea of the Welsh Council, M.C.M.M., but in civil consultation, MWP raised the biggest support.
Senators are actually proposing alternatives, but until the agreement is made, the risk of the headaches of President Erin Jones, who is required to submit a draft plan on renamed change within weeks.
The bill on the reform will also include other reforms involving the legislatures of the legislature and the system of the committee, which includes the structure of the committee.
In the process of the bill, the legislature will have a final decision as to what to call its name.
Macedonia runs a national vote to rename the country.
The vote will be Sunday if you want to change your country's name to the North Macedonian Republic.
The vote was organized to resolve the decades of disputes with neighboring Greece, a region called Macedonia in the country.
For years Greece has strongly opposed Macedonia's joining the EU and the NATO, claiming that the name of the neighboring country in the north deserves its claim to ownership of the territory of Greece.
The Macedonian president, Jorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the national elections of his country's changed country, said he's going to ignore the results of the vote.
However, the supporters of the national election, including Prime Minister Zorran Zayev, claim that rename is the price of collaboration with the EU and NATO.
The bell of St. Martin's church is silent while the church is struggling in Harem.
"When I talk to an old man, I hear that there was always a bar and a church in the past," Adam says.
Now there's no more.
There's no reason why the bar's gone.
"We're communicating in another way," he says.
"The bar was no longer in the living room in the neighborhood like we're going to go through.
For the church, he is concerned that money by selling assets will not last long enough for the authorities to predict that sooner or later they will come to a new end."
In addition, the church will be replaced by apartments and apartments, and the people who live there will not cooperate with the church.
"I think most of the people in this building will be white," he said, "this is quick to close the church.
In 1870, the Metropolitan community was built by a white group.
The original white Mesopotamian Party left in the 1930s.
A group of black people praying nearby owned the building.
Under Pope John Howard Johnson, the minister was adopted by the blacks by a group of chaplains.
The fire caused a lot of damage to the church in 1939, but Father Johnson planned to rebuild it and asked Karion to.
Reverend Johnson and his successor, St. Martin, named Carroll as Bel to the poor.
The performer who plays the canon in July called it "Culture Treasure" and "The Unusual Historic instrument".
According to Tiffanyung of Michigan University, this is the first caulion played by a black musician Dinicio D. Lind.
Mr. Meliwether said St. Martin didn't replace him.
In the past few months in St. Martin, a complex story of the builders, some of which were brought by the followers of the church, and the others were brought by the parishioners.
In July, the pastoral authorities in the parish sent a letter to the parish office asking that the parish should pay its expenses, but the authorities were not involved in hiring architects and contractors.
Some of the parishioners said that the act of the bishop was opaque.
A shark strikes a 13-year-old child who's diving in a lobster in California.
On Saturday, the authorities reported that the shark attacked a 13-year old boy who was swimming in Lobster, California, on the day the Robster season began.
Just before 7:00 a.m., it happened at the Beacon Beach in Ensignitas.
According to KSWB-TV, Chad Hammer, when he was spending an hour and a bath with friends on Saturday morning at San Diego, the boy screamed for help and went out there.
Hamel thought it was just too excited to take the robster at first, but soon she realized it was screaming."
He bit me!
The whole chain has been torn apart when Hamel realized when he rescued the boy.
"They're all screaming, "There's a shark!" Hammer says.
The boy is being transported to a hospital in Radi Tildles in San Diego, where he is in danger.
We don't know what kind of shark was attacked yet.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Jails, who had been in the meeting a few weeks, said that he found that the shark was not a dangerous species.
Furthermore, the boy's body remains extremely severe.
In order to investigate and secure their safety, the authorities blocked from Pont Beach in Casablad to the Estonian beach for 48 hours.
According to Jairs, there are over 35 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plan of Ceynsbury is a major step forward in British beauty markets.
Sirensbury has accepted Boots, Superdrugs, Debenhams on the department store's desperation passage.
As part of the growth of the 28 billion-pound British beauty market, which continues to grow in fashions and household goods, 11 countries are tested and the next year’s shops are expanded.
The investment in beauty was born without looking for ways to use all the space in the shelf when a supermarket was accused of television, electronic ovens, or household items.
According to Ceynsbury, the product has first been branded as Dr. PawPaw,Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. Pawaw.
Existing products such as L'Leal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also be able to get more places in brandspace, like you see in the Buts store.
The shop is based on Viegan’s response to the youth's demand by renewing the booty zone.
In addition, the perfumer's banalance shop divides into two Cerseibury stores last week, one of them opens up the Clinton, South London, and another half of the year later, Birmingham Seary.
With the tendency to buy online shopping and a small amount of food in the region's convenience stores, supermarkets need to be operational to recruit customers.
According to CEO of the Ceynsbury, Mike Coop, the supermarket chain provides more services and reduces food supplies, and the store becomes increasingly decreasing, as it turns against the count of Aldi and Lidl.
Seinesbury has been recruiting hundreds of shops in Argos since he purchased two chains that strengthened the sales of food and increased the profit of the purchase two years ago.
The previous supermarket attempt to renovate beauty and pharmaceutical shops has failed.
The relationship was cracked in the early 2000s as to how to divide profits from the pharmaceuticals.
A new plan came after Ceynsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical stations 3 years ago in Lloyds 3:15.5 million in Celesio.
It also involved Lloyds, a four-house Skin Care brand, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills Hicks, a commercial director of Ceynsbury, says:
I'm investing in a specially trained colleague who will give advice.
Our brand responds to all the needs and shows new beauty business to old businesses in attractive environments and convenient places.
When Holly Willowby withdraws from a million pounds of trading, Peter Joes gets angry.
Dragonsden's Star, Peter Jones, was furious about her withdrawing a million pounds from Peter's lifestyle brand business focusing on a new contract by Holly Willowby, Spencer and ITV.
Willowby cannot spend time with household goods and accessory brand "Truly".
The two businesses were typical of Gnomous Partrow.
This morning, Willoby reported withdrawing from business at Instagram.
Holly Willowby left Peter Jones of Dragonsden's star to withdraw from their favory lifestyle brand business at the time of Gillis, in order to concentrate on a new contract with Marks, Spencer, ITV.
On Thursday, when the Golden Girl show revealed that she could not spend 15 million pounds of a new contract on home and accessory brand "Truly", Jones got angry at a tense meeting at the headquarters in Mahlow, Bakinhamshire.
The project is an example of Gwenness Partrow's Grand brand, doubled the estimated value of Willowby's worth of a million.
When Willoby reported that he was withdrawing from Trugram, he headed off to one of England's cabins.
'Truly is now the highest priority for Holly.'
It's going to be a long-term view of these decades.
Everyone was astonished at the decision to withdraw.
I can't believe what happened on Thursday, it was just there until the sale.
The Merrow company has a lot of stores prepared for sale.
According to experts, the most dependable star of the U.S. has caused hundreds of millions of dollars of investment and sales of products to reach home, cushions, candles, clothes, and clothing.
This means the end of a long friendship.
My three-year-old daughter, Willowby, and her husband, Dan Boldwin, had been willing to give Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
In March, Willoby joined the president of Bapp and Truly in 2016.
The two of them have been on holidays, and Jones has spent 40 percent of their time in the Bavardwin television production company.
Willoby's plans to be "I'm A Celebrity" instead of Ant McPartlin.
'It's the only thing that's going to happen tonight,' said the Hatter.
I had a hard talk, and I fell in love.
The comment was thought to be "unpublicized" and said a joke about the media's criticism of North Korea's leaders that they were too optimistic about.
Why did President Tlump give up?
The President said in his voice: "Day Anchor."
I'm not giving up on anything.
After the first meeting that was held in Singapore in June and praised the president for the huge advances in North Korea, he said he was willing to go to the second meeting.
But the non-nuclear negotiation has ended.
Over three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's chief diplomat, Kaji, pointed to the world's leaders at the United Nations on Saturdays and said that our country has not yet been able to make sure that our early disarmament has not been confirmed.
Instead, he said that the United States is still under control to put pressure on it.
The cards showed a much more entertaining view in Larry's speech.
It's working with North Korea.
"Before, I was going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will die.
It's a great relationship now.
The efforts to improve relations with North Korea have resulted in the end of the missile experiment, the release of innocent hostages, and the conversion of the dead bodies of American soldiers, says Tlump.
And I'm going to use a different metaphor when talking about the relationship between the gold and the thankless.
"It's easy to become president, but now it's called 200 people out outside to fill in the halls of the packed crowd, and Trinket pointed directly to the people in front of his eyes."
A tsunami and an earthquake hit Indonesia, killing hundreds.
In the aftershocks of Lombo earthquake, for example, there is no need for foreign non-government organizations.
Even though more than 10 percent of the population in Ronbok have fallen apart, the country's disaster has not been declared necessary to demand international help.
"I'm afraid I have made it clear that I don't ask for international help in many cases."
The "Save of Dogs" is preparing for pulp, but we still don't know how foreign staff can work on the site.
Supoto, a spokesman for the National disaster organization, said that Indonesian authorities are deciding whether to allow the country to provide aid to the international sector in the situation.
In view of the constant earthquake in Indonesia, the country is hopelessly unprepared for its wrath.
Ace has built a tsunami shelter, but not a lot of other shorelines.
Párdo has obviously few silences of tsunami.
Even if it's the best time, it's a very lisky going to Indonesia.
It's even more complicated because of natural disasters.
The rescue ship that was stationed in Lombo, to carry the victims of the earthquake, is at least three days before it reaches the new disaster zone.
President Joko Widdo has funded the campaign as a center for improving Indonesia’s volatile infrastructure.
However, the next year's reelection has caused the lack of funding to bother Joko's government.
President Joko has been pressured by the tensions that prevail in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims are more conservative in their faith.
More than a thousand people are killed, and tens of thousands are left indoors.

Chelsea took a point from Edendhazard, a Belgian star in 25 minutes.
Bruce Strikeer stopped Matheo Kovachi from running to Liverpool near Midfield.
Kovachi made a quick Gibb-and-go in Midfield.

The chromewell statue of the National Assembly will be the latest monument to the revision of history.
The ban was poetic justice, which was for the destruction of many British cultural and religious Artifacts that were destroyed by fanatic Puritans like the Taliban.
He said he's trying to revise his history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, says: "The object of Oliver Cromwell’s image outside Westminster Palace was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of images.
The symbol of British civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps different Cromwell was sacrificed by the actions of the ancestors of Tomas in the past century.
The grand expression by Sir William Hamo Sonny Cromwell is part of the history of a man who believed that 19th century was still worth celebrating.
Mr. Gold Smith says to the telegraph on Sunday: "Chrommwell was a defender of the parliament against foreign oppression in the late 19th century, in his case, of course, of course, the monarch.
It's the subject of a history dispute that remains to be seen whether it's completely correct.
It is true that the 17th century's conflict has shaped the country's development, and Cromwell is aware of one side of the division.
His merit as Lord PROTECTOR is also celebrated and merited.
Killer Piggs' malls kill Chinese farmers.
According to local media, pigs attacked farmers in markets west of China.
The only man who knew what the name "Yuan" was on the market of the six-eyed water in the state of Okinawa, reported that the bloodstained around the pigs were found on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, at a swine farm in West China, the swine farmers were vaccinated by pigs.
He was with his cousin on Wednesday moving to sell 15 pigs in the neighboring South Korean market.
The next morning, I found him dead, and found the door to the next pig.
In the hut, he says there was a large bloodstain in his mouth.
According to a medical test, 550 pounds of pigs have killed farmers.
"Oh, my feet were bloody and fussy," says Guiyang Ding News.
Surveillance cameras show where Yuan enters the market to feed pigs on Thursday afternoon at 4:40 p.m.
His body was about an hour after he died.
The pig that killed a man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
The market administrator said that the pigs are quarantineed against the Ding News and the police are collecting evidence.
Yuan's family and market manager are said to be negotiating compensation on his death.
In rare cases, pigs have already attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in a farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to her husband.
Ten years ago, a 600-pound pig trapped a Welsh farmer in a truck, and his wife got rid of the animals.
In 2012, after Iron Farmers were eaten by pigs, a farmer told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood is triggered.

I'm not going to hunt you with curiosity and curiosity.

At that time, the audience was average at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Other companies, such as PBS, CSPAN, Fox ビジネス Network, have not been able to get any soon.

During CNN's live broadcast, he was standing in a closet.
"I am standing in front of you," said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He said, "You have the power because of the ineffectiveness of a woman."
According to Freck, his office said that before the elevator was closed, we should talk more at the committee's hearings.
A few hours later, when the Attorney General has voted to vote for Kavano, all broadcasters will start live broadcasting.
But Frek said that only with the understanding of the FBI's investigation of the candidates next week, as a few of the Democrats claim.
Freckle was so sure of his friend's conversation with Christine Coins.
Freckle's decision was made after the conversation with Coins and the other Senate.
Freak had the power, because it was clear that the Republicans could not vote for Kavano without the investigation.
President Thompson has the FBI investigated the complaint against Kavano.

Despite being considered illegal by Madrid, tensions grow in independent areas of October 1 after vote on October 1, the Separatist Catalan who was blessed by it.
The voters were overwhelmingly independent, but the opponents were less likely to vote because of the boycott.
According to the authorities, last year the police tried to stop the election in the polls, killing about 1,000 people.
An independent group had been camping all night on Friday to stop the protests by the National Police.
Our work has progressed, but we have been forced to move on another way.
An electrical engineer, Narcis Telm, who is involved in the activities of his wife and separatist activity, 68, says there is no hope for Catalonia that will no longer be independent.
Last year was the best opportunity.
He said, "I've seen my parents vote, and I'm crying, and now I'm stuck."

The second hibernian side of Gary Holt was combined to prove that Dory Menga's attack was different.
The side of Gerard's season's premiership is the last one to survive Away without victory and meets the leader'sハーtz, which will traffic 8 points at 8 points next Sunday.

Livingston misses the chance of a dull visitor.
The Hot team was supposed to have been ahead of you long before they scored.
Scott Robinson broke down and forced his efforts to the goal.
The host was happy that the Raners could play in front of them.
And that's one way to do that.
The Rangers accepted the Frecks, and Richardson set up the megas with a combination of amplifications, decramble gangsters, and Robinson.
By that time the rangers had control over their property, but they couldn't get through the Home-Defances, and the goal keykeeper Liam Kelly was hardly in the way.
The pattern lasted a half after Halo Morelos forced the safety from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied because the Rangers' golden keys are alummageder and ligo's feet were widely accepted by the other livingストン set play.
The cross came into the Livingston box, and it's been clear all the way down, and Halekett was replaced by Glen Middleton, and the two self-declarations on the handballs were rejected.
It's "a phenomenon in Libingston."
Alas Dealmont, BBC Scotland, Tony Macarone,
As a result of the extraordinary performance of the Livingston.
For men, they were good, beyond expectations of their superior tracks.
But since he arrived, a great credit must go to Hilk to see how he supplied the power to the team.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Harkett had compiled a beautifully organized defense with Minga's vinyl and Joe Worlall in line with his feet.
The Ranger, however, was lacking in inspiration.
They were as good as they were sometimes under Gerard, and they didn't fully reach their standards.
Their final ball was missing-- they were the only one that was open to the home side, and it was like a wake-up call to the Rangers.
Eduardan, you'll have a mix of releases in Kelne.

The police pointed out a security reason for preventing more than 25,000 strong crowds from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of their supporters were soon found to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Eldan protesters have also heard their voices and blamed the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests of the conflict reflect dissatisfactions among some German Turks who are welcome by some German visitors and dictators.
Deputford Road crash: a bicycle driver killed in a collision with a car.
In London, a bicycle driver was caught in a car crash.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a road full of traffic in the southeastern part of the city at 10:15 in England.
The driver in the car stopped by an ambulance, but the man died on the scene.
A month after the crash, about a mile after the death of another bicycle driver on Chinadale, a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said police are encouraging police to identify men and report to relatives.
The road is closed, bus diverting, and drivers are urged to avoid the area.
Long-Latin prison: six guards, injured.
The guard said that six guards were wounded in a man's strict security riot.
There's still a disturbance going on around the English day, 09:30 on HMP Longlauttin, Woostershire.
The special "Tornes" guards were called to deal with the riots in the wings of eight prisoners.
Cops were treated at the crime scene with a slight scar on their faces.
The warden who was specially trained was arranged to deal with what was going on in HMP LongLatin.
Six members of the staff have been treated with injuries.
We will not allow violence in prison, nor will we be held accountable by the police, and we will spend a lot of time in prison.
HMP Longlatin holds more than 500 prisoners together with the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the head of the prison was reported being treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, a riot squad was called to prison to deal with the serious uproar of the staff's attack on the Brigium balls.
Hurricane Rossa's steel cannons, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City are at risk.
It is rare for tropical low temperatures to occur in Arizona, but it is very risky in the early next week for the remaining energy of Hurricane Rossa to cross the Southwest Desert.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Agency has already issued a warning of the turbulence from the Phoenix, flug staff, Las Vegas, west of Nevada, south of Nevada and east of California and Yuta, including Sol Lake City.
Rosa gets close to rain by Monday and will be expected to hit Phoenix on Tuesday.
Phoenix's National Weather Agency has tweeted that since 1950 there are only 10 low-pressures that maintain heat storms and low pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix's.
Katrina was a hurricane within 40 miles of AZ boundary.
The latest national hurricane center model predicts two to four inches of rainfall and the biggest six-in-a-half-in-a-half-in-a-half-in-one rainfall in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including Central Rocky and Greyt Bayes, may range from one to two inches, and may be up to four inches.
The rains of Rosa may be too expensive for those who are not risking ammunition.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, some of the rainfall may be useful because the Southwest is currently dry.
According to the United States, at least 40 percent of Arizona's dryest state is at least in the highest category, and Weather.com's dry monitor reported:
To begin with, the Hurricane Rosser course is located across and across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Hurricane Rossa’s strength is at 85 miles an hour in the morning and north at 12 miles an hour in 385 miles south of Punta Eugene, Mexico.
The storm hits the cool water in the Pacific, and that is why it loses its strength.
As a result, it is predicted that on Monday afternoon, or at night, heat - low temperatures will surface in Mexico.
The risk of heavy rainfall in Mexico is due to major floods.
Weather.com reported: "The total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches, up to 10 inches from Baja to North Sonola.
Before she gets near the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, she will cross Mexico as a rainstorm and travel down Arizona by midnight.
"Roza, and its main dangers to the impact are the heavy rainfall in Baja, north of Sonola, and in the United States," said National Halleken Center.
It is predicted that the rain will cause life to be in danger, the silhouettes in the desert, and the landslides in the mountains.
Med-Sammer Notan Attak: 4 undetected.
Three teenage boys and 20-year-olds were arrested for attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old stab in Samette.
Saturday, 04:00 BST, a teenage boy was found injured in the Excells Terraces of Mid-Sammer's Day.
He's brought to the hospital, and he's in a stable state.
The Summer Police said that two 17-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested in Avon's Radstock, 18-year-olds, and 20-year-olds arrested overnight.
The police are waiting for someone to come forward with a cell phone footage of what happened.
The cards say Cabalo is suffering from the debauchery and anger of the Democratic party.
"The vote for Cabino is the vote of the Democratic Party's insolent and vicious way.
In his mission, he said that he was suffering from the lowness and anger of the Democratic party.
Kavanno testified before the assembly on Thursday, and was powerfully denied her claim that she had sexually assaulted Christine Broysford decades ago when they were tens of years old.
The feed also testified on her claims by court.
The president said that the American people saw the beauty and humanity of Kavano that day and courage.
"The vote to approve of Judge Cabino is one of the best legal spirit of our time, one of the best public record, and he told the crowds of West Virginia's supporters:
The president spoke out in the middle election about the importance of the Republican Party's party, and he pointed out to Kavano's recommendations.
"One of the most important elections in our lives is five weeks.
I'm not going out of the horse, but I'm actually running around.
"So, I'm all over the place to fight for the great candidates."
He argued that the Democratic Party was his duty to "responsible, obstruction".
When the first key procedural vote to the Senate Council in Cabino's office took place by Friday, the CEO of the GOP said to CNN:
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds and more victims.
At least 384 people died and many were swept away on Saturday, after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Sulawesi island in Indonesia, and a wave of waves poured into the beach.
Hundreds of people were gathering on Friday at the beach at the end of the day, and a wave of 6 meters (18 ft) at night reached the shore, and many were swept away, and all the roads were destroyed.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 Magnitide.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were on the beach and they didn't run away soon.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, car, wood, house, and land was hit with 'Ngrojo' said, and then it went outside 800 kf (497 mph) before it hits the shore."
He said that some climbed up trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people evacuated to the 24-central center of Palm.
A flight photo published by the police found many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges smashed and moss surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city had a tremor.
We felt a series of earthquakes in the area where 24,000 people are living.
Indonesia's Administrative Technology Accessation Agency noted that the energy released on a Friday earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that fell to Hiroshima during World War II.
He said that the scale of tsunamis could have expanded on the streets at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nagrojo explained that the damage was widespread: thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the debris of the destroyed building, and he said that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Negroho said the damage to the carcass and damage to the carcass is worse than the North Coast of Palm, 300 km (0.3 km) away, a region called Dongala, a region near the earthquake.
"There was no information from Dongal, and no communication was completely disabled," said Nagrojo.
The Red Cross stated in a statement that more than 30 people live there.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Authorities say the waves were coming during warning signs, but on Saturday the authorities were widely criticized for not reporting that the tsunami attacked the pulp.
I heard the amateur video shared by social media, shouting that men on the top of the building were desperately approaching the people on the street.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, buildings and cars swept away.
Reuters couldn't authenticate the footage immediately.
Because the earthquake and tsunami have caused massive blackouts and lack of communications around the pulp, the authorities have a hard time working with rescue efforts.
Armys are starting to carry relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities on cargo planes, but refugees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport is only resumed for relief efforts, but it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widdo will be visiting the Center for Refugees on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami victims have reached more than 800.
It's so bad.
While the staff of the Worldvisions in Dongal arrived safely to the city of Pala, where employees are sheltering a waterproof sheet set up in their office, Dseva said they saw the scene of the devastation on the road.
He told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses.
It's so bad.
Relief groups have begun to show the start of disaster relief efforts, but some claim that foreign relief workers who have a deep expertise are preventing their journey to Par.
According to Indonesia's regulations, foreign supplies and materials will only start to flow if the disaster site is declared a country's worst disaster area.
That's not happening yet.
"It's still a state-level disaster," said Auria Ariani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"It's a disaster," he said, "and the government says, "this is a disaster in the country."
On Friday, the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palm, friends and family were still missing, hoping that those loved will be the miracles of the tragedy of natural disasters.
The boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
A rescuer delivered a woman trapped under a rubble on Sunday alongside her mother's body for two days.
In Indonesia, Gendon Sbandno, a coach for the National Paradepading team in Indonesia, served two missing paraguayers at the Asian Convention earlier this month.
His students were among those confined to the Roala Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
"I've got my own emotional burden as a Senior in Paraguay," he said.
In a few hours after the news of the collapse of the Roaror Hotel, Mr. Gendon spent a few hours in the Paraguay community telling the European Community Corporation whatsApp messages were urgently sent to him during the beach festival.
His message resulted in only gray checks instead of blue checks.
"I think that means that it didn't get a message," he said.
On Revie's new port, thieves plundered $26,750 while the ATM was repatriated.
According to news release from the police station in Newport, the thief stole $226,750 when his employees were repatriated at the ATM in Levi's new port.
The car driver was preparing to empty an ATM at the entertainment compound, delivering more money, and Denise MacArtsey wrote to Lily:
While he was working, another man ran from behind the Bub's employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
According to Reese, witnesses witnessed several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police didn't identify the number of people involved in the case.
If you have information about their identity, contact the Newport Police to 859-29-3680.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Lampkinye West will change his name to Y.
When he announced a change on Saturday, he wrote: "Armagedly known as Cannie West."
The 41-year-old West has sometimes been named Ye and Y, and its name was used as the title of his 8th albums sold in June.
The changes will be made before Yandhi's new album is expected to be released in the Saturday Night Live.
He canceled for emotional reasons, instead of Ariana Grande, he went out to show, said Shaw's Creator.
He said that West had a religious significance in the past, as did the abbreviation of his current professional name.
"I believe "y" is the most used word in the Bible, and it means "you" in the Bible.
"It's all about us," said Mary.
It begins with the only part of what we mean, our good, our evil, and all the reflection of our perplexing.
That album reflects more about who we are.
He's one of the most famous rappers that ever changed his name.
Sean Coms is known to many people as Paffe, P.D., or Dedee, but he announced his choice this year, called Love and Brothers Love.
The former West collaboration contractor, JAY-Z, also made it without a hyphen or an uppercase.
Mexico's AMLO swears to the civilians to use the army for the night.
Andrew Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected Mexican president, vowed that the country would never use military forces against the public for the 50th anniversary of the retaliation of blood for students.
Lopes Obrador promised that he would never use his military power to suppress Mexicans on Tratroco Plaza Saturday.
On October 2, 1961, the left-wing student movement was rooted in Latin America, a peaceful protest was launched in Plaza, where 300 died then.
Lopes Obrador provides subsidies for those who study, gives free money every month to state universitys, promises to help young Mexicans.
He said that the absence of unemployment and educational opportunities led young people to go to criminal gangs.
The U.S. has to double its financial support.
China should double the amount it spends on research in the field by artificial intelligence and Kaai-Fuigh, an investor at AI, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple, says:
While the United States is generally scarce in the AI strategy, its comments were given in various departments of the U.S. government after the AI report.
In the meantime, China introduced the plan last year: By 2030, it aimed the number one in AI innovation.
By doubleing the AI research budget, it would be a good start for all other countries to consider that they are far behind the United States and that we are asking for the next march in AI, Lé said.
More than doubled funding in AI in the United States, and more opportunities for the next major achievements, Lee told an interview in CNBC this week.
The book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" is released this month by Hawton Miflin Harcot and is investing in the most famous AI company in China, Fice+.
In the 1980s at Carnegieméron, he created a system of AI that carried a top Oceloat player in the United States, and then he became the president of the Hong Kong Executive in Microsoft Research.
He agreed to a previous U.S. technical tournament, like the Robottic Challenge of the National Institute of Investigation, and asked if the next day would be the next time he would be able to help find his prospective president.
The U.S. researchers worked hard to get government benefits, said Lé.
"Women are not taking the scholarly leader; we work together," said Lé.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies hire leaders from AI in recent years.
He said that changes in immigration policies would also help to strengthen his efforts to AI in the United States.
"I think I should automatically give a green card to PhD in AI field."
China's Ministry of State has launched a new generation of artificial intelligence development program in July 2017.
China's National Institute of Natural Science has provided people with money in the same way as the National Science Fund and other government agencies pay the U.S. researchers, but it is not the quality of Chinese scholarship.
In the United States this year, the Ministry of Defense has founded the Joyt Artificial Initiative Center, which intends to join partners in the company and the science industry, and the White House has announced a special committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA has published an investment of two billion dollars to the initiative called AI's Next.
The NSF is currently doing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. rule for artificial intelligence to establish a national security commission has not been seen for months.
The Macedonians will vote for a change of name and citizenship.
The Macedonians have been making a 10- year-old dispute with Greece, who either changed their name to the North Macedonian Republic on Sunday or voted for a national election, and had stopped their membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, a state called Macedonia, has voted to join the NATO and the EU, saying that the northern part of the country is insisting on its territory.
The two government signed an agreement based on a new name promulgated in June, while the nationalist argues that this change will destroy the ethnic identity of the major Slav population in Macedonia.
President Guerrugui Iwanoov does not vote for national votes, and the Boucitian campaign has raised doubt as to whether the votes will meet at least 50 percent of the votes validated.
Read the questions about the vote: "Acquiesition with Greece, do you agree to become a member of the NATO and EU?"
The supporters of the renamed renamed Prime Minister Zoran Zayev argue that it is worthwhile for Macedonia, one of the countries that has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of Macedonian youth for the future, so they'll be free to live under the European Union's umbrella, because it means a safer life for us.
Although not legally binding, he said that the majority of the parliament maintained their votes for the decision.
So we're going to need a third of the parliament to rename it.
The newsletter said that by 1:00 p.m. the week was not reported.
However, the polling rate was only 16 per cent compared with 34 per cent of the previous parliament vote in 2016.
"I came to vote for my children, and our place is in Europe.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zorran Zayev, his wife, Zorcaica and his son Dasco, joined the Republic of Macedonia in the country's reputation of NATO and European Union on September 30, 2011.
Before Skopje's parliament, Vladimir Kavardkov, 54 years old, prepared a small stage and pulled the chair before the tent set up by people who voted for the nation.
"We agree with NATO and EU but not through the service door.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
"If they don't accept us as Macedonia, they can become part of the European Integration, relying on other countries like China and Russia."
Prime Minister Zayev says NATO will bring in the investment necessary for Macedonia, which is more than 20 percent unemployed.
"I believe the majority support the EU and NATO because more than 80 percent of the people support the EU and NATO.
He said that the results of "Jesus" would be proof of our future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute, voters from 30 to 43 percent said they would participate in the national elections - lower the votes required.
Another poll conducted by Termah TV in Macedonia said that 57 percent of the responders were going to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote for consent.
We need 50% and one vote to succeed.
The failure to vote will be the first severe blow to the parents and the Western government since the birth of last May.
I don't know.
Serhio Agulo and Raheim Starling, in Manchester's Emergency Stadium, England, won 2-0 victory at the Upper Demention Day in Brighton City.
Aguiro decided to score as easily as stupid as 65 minutes ago.
The Argentine striker was first picked up by the Midfield.
He competed with the three Brighton Dickin before he left the open field.
The Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed one end of defernder, followed another at the end of the Brighton box.
And he found Starling and left the path.
England's president, FW, used the first tag in the box to turn the ball over to Agulo and hit the shot on the right side of the net with the right boots.
"Agulo was having trouble with his feet, and Pepe Gualudiola, the City manager, told the returners:
"We're playing for 55,60 minutes.
That's how it happened.
He decided to score at that moment, and we were lucky.
But it was Starling who gave SkyBlue the first Adventure in Premier League's war.
That goal happened in 29 minutes.
Agués got his balls deep in the Bryton area at that match.
He sent a beautiful route along the left side to Leroy Suine.
Sane kicked the starling several times before she turned him to the Fapoast.
Just before SkyBlood's followers slipped into the border, they pushed their balls online.
At the Rhine Necker Alena in Zimbabwe, Tuesday afternoon, 55th, the city fights Hofenheim.
Sharzer wants to play Spyler.
Nationalists have been removed from play-off fights, so there's hardly a reason to start a new one.
However, the fightsome sergeant wants to take a mound on Sunday, but it is only possible that the game's impact on the Rockys who lead Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West is still on the other side.
Lockies wins at least 5-2 Nationals on Friday night, but he wants to be the first district champion.
"We can at least throw it out, even if we have no sense of play, and the crowd will be more likely to play at any point where the Denver's atmosphere and the other team face this year."
And I said, "No, I'm not going to do that.
Nationalists have not released the Starr on Sunday yet, but they report that they will pick Shaser up in such a situation.
He's going to start his 34th birthday, and he's going to throw it on Thursday's blip season, usually on Sunday break.

The cards are a big-time conference in West Virginia.
When the president is discussing the importance of the Republican Party in the middle election, he spoke out about the situation in which the highest court will choose Breet Kavano.
"All that we've been through will be in November."
"One of the most important elections in our lives is five weeks.
He said, "This is one of the big things--I don't go out, but I'm actually running, and I'm in a position to fight for the great candidates."
'I'm sure you'll see what's going on right now,' said the Duchess.
They're determined to restore power through any means they need. They'll know it's sarcasm and uncomfortable.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to ignore, to gain power and control, because they want it to be power and control, we don't give it to them."
The Democratic Party said it was his mission to "responsible, obstruction".
"And in the last four days, he said he'd seen it, and he'd angered the Democrats, and called them despoiling, distasteful, and unfaithful."
He took the Senate Council's position in honor of President Diane Fainstein, and got a big barrage from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?

Oh, God.
No, no, no, no, no, I'm really the worst body rungage I've ever seen.
The Labor Party is no longer a large church.
I can't bear to the people who speak the heart.
I was almost astonished when the Momentum activist from my local political party voted to evacuate me.
After all, I'm in the front row of the Labor Party's MP that I'm not welcome - all speak the spirit.
My associate of parliament, Joan Ryan, has been treated similarly because he was strongly up against anti-Socialism.
In my case, the action of denounced Jeremy Kolvin.
The issue was the importance of responsible economic policies, national security, and irony in Europe, and Jeremy did not agree to the leaders of the past.
“In noting the Nointingham East Labor Party on Friday, we want to make the meeting more comprehensive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as the local Labor Party MP, the GC meeting for Friday night was just like that.
Sadly, today it's not the Ton of many meeting meetings, and if it has really begun, it has been forgotten the promise of a better and kinder policy.
It is gradually becoming clear that various views are not approved by the Labor Party, and only when it comes to saying that all the opinions are acceptable to the leaders of the party.
This started right after Jeremy became the leader.
Whenever I say that it is not so important to talk about what I'm talking about, the demand for revoked elections, the criticism of the center's policy, and the growing gruesome tide of social media, I said I shouldn't be in the workforce.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, they tend to make comments about me political, and I think I'm lucky more than some of my colleagues.
We face every day of sexual discrimination or discrimination abuse, but we are by no means ashamed of our fellow workers' professional awareness and commitments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is what kind of abuse has become.
Last week, Jeremy Colbin claimed that the Labor Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
It is true that we are no longer a large church, and that we are not sure at all, or that the changes in party choices are becoming smaller.
For the past two years, I have tried to be humble so that I can't be too loud.
But that's not how we're going to go into government.
Since I joined the Labor Party as a student 32 years ago, I have been invited to the neglect of the Sacher government that literally destroyed my board of school classrooms, and I have tried to support the local legislature, or the Minister of government, and to support a better public service for the most necessary people.
I never hid my policy, including the last election.
Noutham East was confused about my political status and how I disagree with the current leader.
For those who advocate the movement on Friday, the country is struggling with family, business, and Blagegit that damages our public service, and does not understand my desire to waste my time and energy on the labor leader.
But the message from me is not against the mientam of Nottingham, but for my supporters who may be a member of the labor force: I am proud to work for you, and I promise you that I will not be able to overpower my belief that the threat or political advantages of all of you will be of the best benefit.
Chris Leslie is the MP of the Nottingham East.
Air 38-17 Merros:
Although the final results may have changed by two delayed trais, Aaya deserves to win today in this beautiful, entertaining premier match.
Now they're on top of the table, and only 10 lost sides.
At the end of the day, it would be a better opportunity for a good middle class, and the coach Peter Marcie had every happy right.
"We've been tested through the games, and we should still be helpless and happy."
'I don't know,' said Melross Robin Christy:
The 14th strike of Grant Anderson, instead of Floyd Kremo, was launched by Wallace, and with Rory Hewes' yellow card, he gave Merrows a number, and Jason Baggot took away the unchanged strike.
Clymo extended Ere Reed with a penalty just before Harf time and decided Solotori to take a break in Ea at 17-5.
But Melross went into the middle of the day, and Patrick Anderson's travel from Baggot shrinked to five points.
Then, after a long wait for Luriado Nottot, carried on a heavy streak, and then reopened, Aaya went further to the Stafford McDonaldwall trai instead of Klimo.
Captain Blair McPherson received a yellow card, and then Melrows repaid the extra player for Bruce Corvin's attempt at the end of the heavy presser spell.
However, homesides came back, and Shruan Huttinson took Klimo without a ball and got a yellow card and landed behind the Eakferon's advance from the Penalty Out.
After Kyle Loe collects the box keys of David Armstrong, the Kremo has sent his Frankie Gregor Henley to the 5th Trail on the home side.
The Still Game Star is going to build a new career in the restaurant industry.
Stair game star Ford Kieran was prepared to move to the Hospatiiti industry after he found out that he was named director of a licensed restaurant.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis writes with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphill, and shows a popular BBC program for collaboration.
The duo announced that the 9th series will be the last of the show, and Kyanen seems to be planning to live after Craign.
According to official records, he is a director of Adrift Mound Limitid.
Scotish Sun's sources said that Kyanen is trying to get involved in Glasgow's fast restaurant trade, but the actor refused to comment on the story.
"The sea belongs to us":
The sailors patrol the marine headquarters equipped with La Paz's convoy.

Through the bloody 19th-century resource conflict through the interior of Bolivia, memories of the shoreline are still bright and eager to sail again across the Pacific.
Perhaps these hopes are best in decades, in order to wait for the decision of the International Court of Justice after a five-year debate.
"Bobolia has a strong and united spirit, and of course, she expects the results with positive perspective," said Bolivian diplomat Robert Carzadilla.
Many Bolivians look at the IICJ decision on a major screen throughout the country and expect that Hague's court will agree with Bolivia's claim that after decades of entertaining agreements, Shei will be obliged to negotiate a negotiation of her lordship to the sea.
Ebo Morares, president of the Aboriginal Carisma, Bolivia, who is facing a reelection next week, also participated in the Monday decision.
"We're very close to going back to the Pacific," he promised in the end of August.
However, some analysts think the courts are less likely to decide for Bolivia, and they will not change much.
The U.N. government has established that the Netherlands does not have the authority to grant the territory of Chile and must decide the possible agreement.
Its decision was made only six months after the final debate, and it showed that the incident was not complicated, says Paz Zalate, an international law expert.
And it's not too far away to get to the point where it's been retreated in the past four years.
"The problem with access to the sea was taken by the current Bolivian government," Zarate said.
She suggested that the wart Retrick of Morales had broken the goodness of Tiri left.
Bolivia and Chile may keep talking to each other until the moment, but it is very difficult to continue the discussion after that.
And I'm going to show you a little bit more about what I've done since 1962.
President Eduard Rodriguez Velz, president of Hague, denied the idea that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia said it would be a "special opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" and that it would bring an opportunity to end the 39-year conflict with mutual interests.
Carzadilla also denied that Morares (one of the most popular presidents in Latin America) is using the ocean as a political support.
"Bobia will never abandon access to the Pacific," he added.
It's an opportunity to know we need to overcome the past.
North Korea says it's not a nuclear disarmament if we don't trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Li Yonjo says that unless Washington can't be trusted, his country will never get rid of the nuclear weapons at the beginning.
Li was speaking to the United Nations Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the U.S. to follow the promise made during a speech in Singapore between rivals.
His comments are made up of the United States.
Li says it's an imaginary dream for the United States to continue its regime and bring the war to an end.
Washington is concerned that the rhetoric will not enter the first major disarmament movement, and agree with this declaration.
Kim and the U.S. President Donald Talk want a second head meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that flattery is seriously taking place in the dumping of weapons that may be considered the only way to guarantee security.

Paris's fashion show has released the latest line for a large headway and has been brought to High Street near you.
If you want to block the sun, you're going to add a collection of hats.
designer Valentino and Tom Brown have announced a linenap for the SS19-size-headed collection of the Paris Fashion Week.
The very impractical pigeons sprang in instagram in this summer, and these designers sent Cat Wark their work to watch their eyes.
The work that attracted Valentino's eyes was a hat of an oversaw beehive with a wide bouquet with a feather with a modeled head.
Other over-size accessories had squirms made of jewels, magic hats, more pineapples, but they were not designed to keep their heads warm.
Tom Brown also released a strange mask release that was just in time to Halloween.
Many of the multicolored masks were more like Hannibal Lecter than they called the AutoCutur.
One was like a full Cuban diving gear in Schnorkel and Goggle, but another was like melted ice cream corn.

John Edward: The language skills required for global citizens
Scotland’s private school has maintained its academic achievements and has continued on to 2018 as a different set of tests that are only enhanced by individual and collective success in the accomplishments of sports, art, music, and other communities.
These schools, which represent over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are trying to provide the highest level of services for students and guardians.
The private school aims to prepare students for higher education, their chosen careers, and to live in society as global citizens.
In this educational sector, which is designed and implemented by custom maid school curriculum, the modern language is found to have continued to be a popular school wish.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak words that you understand, it's going to be in your head.
When he speaks in his native tongue, it enters into his heart.
This reminds us that when we build relationships and trust with other countries, we should not rely only on English.
The recent test results of this year show that language tops the leak table, and that private school has the highest standards of success.
A total of 68 percent of the students learned a foreign language got Hayagrad A.
A data collected from 74 schools in the SCIS has shown that 72 percent of Beijing students learn Beijing, while 72 percent of German students learn German, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spanish.
This shows that the school’s private school in Scotland is encouraging foreign language learning as a vital skill that children and young people need in the future.
Currently, the language is treated as a subject of the same type as the science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and so on in private schools curriculum.
In a 2014 survey by the British Job Skills Institute, 17 percent of the employers have found that they have lacked language skills.
Thus, for young people to prepare for future careers, language skills are essential.
These skills are essential in situations where globalization affords more opportunities for work.
If you get a foreign language, whatever career you choose, it will be a real advantage in the future.
The fact that you can communicate directly with foreign people means that multi-lingual material is a competitive advantage.
In 2013, YouTube surveys of more than 4,000 British adults found that 75 percent had no foreign language capability to talk, and only 15 percent were French.
That's why it is important for children today to invest in language education.
Especially for children in developing countries, it would be more likely to gain meaningful jobs by having multiple language skills.
In Scotland, different languages are taught by each school.
While many schools focus on more traditional modern languages, other schools will see 2020, such as Beijing and Japanese, and they will teach the most important language for Britain.
There are professionals in this field, no matter what the child is interested in, and there are many language choices in school.
Scottish private schools are busy providing you with a learning environment that will allow your children to develop the skills they need to be prepared for the future and to be successful.
In global business environments, language is so important for the future that it should be reflected in education.
In fact, the modern language should be considered an international communication skill.
The private school will continue to provide this choice and diversity for Scottish youth and better education.
Ilfaut bien le faire.
John Edward is the case at the Scottish Private Council.
Rebron, Raquel Deview on Sunday in San Diego.
Rebron James is soon to decorate the fan-gathering Los Angeles Rakers View.
Reyk's director Luke Walton announced that James will be on Sunday at the end of the pre-monition with Denver Naggitz in San Diego.
But I don't know how many minutes he's playing.
And Walton says, "I'm not going to be able to do that in less than one minute or less than 48 minutes.
Remarkers of the Raquels, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James would have only limited time.
After training early this week, James was asked about the schedule of the six games of the Rakers Presets.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need a prenatal game to prepare for the season."
Larry, West Virginia, cards, and YouTube channels
President Donald Trumpet will begin a series of elections tonight from Wedding in West Virginia.
This is the first of the five scheduled meetings next week, including Tennessee, Mississippi, and other friendly trolleys.
Today, the Supreme Tribunal has held a vote on which the Republican Party is in danger of losing over half the majority of its elections in November and aiming to establish support for mid-term elections.
What time will be held in West Virginia for tonight's cards and how can we see them online?
The tournament in West Virginia will be scheduled at 7:00 p.m., September 29, 2011.
Larry in West Virginia on the cards can read online on the live stream on YouTube:
While the FBI is investigating the sexual assault of the Supreme Tribunal, Mr. Brett Cavano, as the FBI investigated the sexual assault of the Supreme Court, it is more likely that the Talklane would comment on this week's public hearing.
However, the main objective of this upcoming gathering is to play up against the Republican party's forces in the face of a difficult war station for elections in November.
According to Reuters, the five meetings of the next week are aiming to strengthen volunteers and supporters to protect the majority of joints in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
The president will visit as many states as he can during a very busy election season because the majority of parliaments are so important to his policies that he will visit them.
According to Metro news in West Virginia, a meeting scheduled for Wesvancourna in Weinginging may be reported in Pittsburgh's media by gathering supporters from Ojai and Pensilbania.
The cards won over 40 percent in West Virginia in 2016, but Saturday’s visit to West Virginia will be a second visit in a month.
The cards are trying to support Patrick Morrissey, a West Virginia sympathizer who is delaying in public investigations.
According to Reuters, the political scholar of West Virginia said that the president's coming to push him is not a good sign for Morrissey.
The Ridder Cup 2018: The United States has shown the willingness to fight with hope on the singleth of Sunday.
After three games in one session, the Forshams of Saturday afternoon had just begun to demand this Reder cup.
While the concept of 'strong' is unfounded in sports, especially in such contests, the players truly believe in the "strong".
And I'm going to say, "Well, I'm not going to be able to do this."
"I've got six points up, and I think we're a little more powerful now because we've got four points."
Of course, the choice of Europe is four points ahead of 12 games.
As Speace says, there are many good factors in addition to the popularity of piece and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each had three points in four games.
Smitch has been relentlessly attacked from Tetty to Green, leading to a seemingly extremist outcome.
He and Thomas were reed two points after two halls, but as the whole round went on, the shout of blessings began to grow, sinking the decisive Pat to the fourth match.
Similar male screams that he raised at the time of his victory in 15 halls conveyed his belief that the U.S. team didn't lose yet.
"I have to focus on my games and do everything I can," Smitch says.
Now these players have only one match left.
18 halls won.
Only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Friedwood, the biggest topic in the Raider cup, have raised more points in two days.
These two odd and loving European choicers have won four fighting battles without making mistakes.
The two "Moriwood" were not the only ones that didn't hit Bogie in their session on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the Bogies during the Saturday afternoon, Friday afternoon, and half nine hours after Friday morning.
If you look at the energy flowed between the turbulent crowds in addition to carrying such games, it is clear that they are the players that should be defeated on Sunday, and that there will be no more popular players than Fleetwood and Morinari in the last battle of the European Union.
I want you both to accomplish it at the same time in another hall.
However, the Europeans have not yet won the victory.
Baba Watson and Web Simpson have easily won to Sergio Garcia and Alex Nolen, a Forkball hero during the morning.
Garcia and Lennon couldn't swirl around after they dug their graves out of Bogies and two double bogies in the last half-9 hall.
Sunday, there's no one else to help.
Favorite and Forsham are very interesting to see in each pair the advice they will not offer, and the advice they will not offer, and the instant change in strategy.
Although the European Choice has been a better team and has been a big lead to the final day, the Forsham session showed that its choices are particularly motivated to fight the concerns of the United States side.
Last day in the Rider Cup, the European Union is reed by 10-6.
After a Saturday fight between Fortham and Forsham, the Europeans have been leading the United States in 10-6 reelecting their last day in the Rider Cup.
Tommy Fleetwood and Franco Molinarii have won two wins over the bitter Tiger Woods, and now they have reached four points in Le Golf National.
Two years ago, Tomas Biyo's European choice to steal the trophy he lost in Hazeltin ruled over the unfamiliar U.S. in the middle of the month in the showball and turned his score into 3-1.
The U.S. Championship was back at Forsham and won two games, but they still couldn't get the difference.
Jim Furric, who is leading the U.S., has to win 8 points on Sunday's singles 12th game to maintain his trophy.
Not only did Fleetwood become the first four points in Europe, but the Fleetwood and the Morilinalis became the second pair in the fourth match of the first four fight.
After they wrote in the Fortball and Patrick Reed, they won with a score of five-and-4 that highlights the impressive bond between the obsession and the Bryson Deshanbo team of Lukis.
Oz, who hasn't been able to stand up on Saturdays, showed great play at times, but not only did he lose 19 out of 29 games in Fortball and Forsham, but he also suffered 7 defeats.
During the morning, Justin Rose, who took a break in the show at Fortham, joined Henry Stenson in the world's first and third Dawn Johnson and Brooks Kepca with two to one.
Southeast Paris has been a good day for the wind to blow, but the choice of Europe has not dominated it as it pleases.
Threeメジャー winners, Jordan Smell and Justin Thomas, raised two points on Saturday and set the criteria for choice in the United States.
After they won Spanish John Lam and Ian Porter, after losing the first two halls, they won Paul and Laurie Makii in 4/3.
In the history of the Rider cup, there's not two or more reversals in the past, but the U.S. leading U.
But for the U.S.'s success over the last two days, it seems that the repatriation of day-to-days is beyond their ability.
The North Koreans say, "I'm sure you'll never be able to disarm a single person without trust."
North Korea's foreign minister said that on Saturday, the United Nations’s regime’s sanctions have increased suspicions against the United States and that they will not release nuclear weapons one way under such circumstances.
The General Assembly of the United Nations (Li Yonjo) said that North Korea took "a significant step of goodwill in the past year, including nuclear testings, missile launching tests, dissolutions of nuclear laboratory, nuclear weapons and nuclear technology".
"But I can't deal with the U.S." he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, our trust in national security will be lost and we will not be disarmed under such circumstances."
His statement is profoundly clear that North Koreans did not immediately reject one non-nuclear approach in the past.
In the first conference between the United States and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, he promised that he would take action to "nuke the Korean Peninsula", and the Talmud made a joint statement that he promised security in North Korea.
North Koreans are demanding the official end of the Korean War between 1950 and 2005, but the United States says North Korea needs to dump nuclear weapons first.
The U.S. government also resisted the call to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States, who asserts "no nuclear first", is more pressured by the regime to achieve its goal, and is further opposed to the "conclusion of war," he said.
"The perception that we can be defeated by the regime is the illusion of those who don't know us."
But the problem is that our distrust continues.
The foreign minister did not mention the plans for the second head meeting of gold and cards that President Thunder highlighted earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, I highlighted three meetings with President Mun Jeine in the last five months and added: "If the non-nuclear person isn't in the United States, the non-nuclear population would not have been able to survive that long.
Even so, the Toton of the U.S. Extreme Speech speech was not dramatic when money called "the president of the evil" and the cards called it "rockman" in a self-destruct operation, and they told North Korea's rockets in the United States last year's General Assembly that it was inevitable to reach the mainland.
Last year, the Turk threatened to destroy North Korea, which praised the United Nations for their courage to disarm, but had many challenges, and he said it was necessary to maintain control until North Korea became nonnuclear.
On Wednesday, if it takes two or three years, it doesn't matter what five months.
China and Russia objected that the United Nations Security Council should reward North Korea's steps.
But U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo tells the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "Perhaps Security must continue until we prove complete and eventually nonnuclear."
Since 2006, security has unitedly strengthened the sanctions against North Korea to block funding North Korea's nuclear missile development.
Pompo has an interview with Kyoto at the US Federation, and then he says he will visit the flat next month to prepare his second head meeting.
Pompo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has failed.
He left the flat in July said there was a progress, but within a few hours North Korea accused him of demanding "a gang".
If the US takes a "responsible post" in an interview with the President of the U.S. this month, they promise to dismantle the missile facility and nuclear facility.
He said that the money was the equivalent of what he wanted was the security that the cards promised in Singapore and the movement towards normalizing relations with the U.S. government.

This year’s Harvard new course aims to have more of its students sleep in order to fight the spread of the 'All Night' culture.
Students at Harvard, the world's largest university, are often ignorant of some of the very basic ways in which the body can be fed.
Charles Zeiter, a PhD professor at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Wymens Hospital, designed this course.
After talking about the effect of sleep loss on learning, he decided to start the course.
"I'm going to tell you a story," he said, "and you're going to tell me the last time a student of women came to me.
"I don't know what I'm talking about," he said, "but I'm surprised that no one told her about the importance of sleep.
In the course for the first time in this year, the students explain the importance of how good sleep habits promote learning and exercise, and increase the general well-being.
Paul Valerie, a psychiatrist professor at Harvard Medical School and director of the University's Medical Services, said that the university decided to introduce a course after realizing its serious lack of sleep among students this week.
One hour course contains a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students can find information about coffee cups in the dormitory, curtains, snikers, effects of caffeine and light effects, impact on sleeplessness, and the importance of daytime sleep.
Another section explains to its audience how long sleep loss can contribute to a heart attack, brain ailments, depression and cancer risk.
And on the campus maps with an interactive icon, we encourage the attendees to think about their daily routine.
"I know that the conduct of the students will never change quickly."
But they have the right to know how smoking will affect their health.
He also said that there is still a culture that proud of "fleeing all night" and that the problem of sleeplessness is increasing because of the increased pressure on Modin technology and students.
Taking sufficient good sleep is a "secret weapon" of students fighting stress, fatigue, anxiety, and sleeplessness, and sleeplessness is always a hunger in their brain, so he says it also prevents weight gain from increasing.
Raymond Thor, from California, who studied chemistry and physics, helped design his course after he was classed at Harvard last year.
He woke up by the course and wanted to expand the entire campus.
The next step he wants is to get a similar learning program before all university students start learning in a competitive place called Harvard.
Professor Zistler recommends that students be alerted at the same time as when they are awake, and that they be released from electronic screens and LEDlights, to be concerned about the harmful "blue" effects that cause common rhythm to malfunction and sleep problems.
Richardson 1 - 0 Rangers:
The Rangers have also been defeated in Away, and the goal of Rividsonton Dory Menga is that Steve Gerard's missing spectators have been defeated at 1-0.
The Rangers, based on Iblocks, aimed at the first Away won since the 4-1 victory in Saint Johnston, February, but Gerard suffered his second defeat in 18 games, and the rangers had eight points to Harts, who were single-stepd in the Scottish Premiership.
The mega raised a goal seven minutes ago, but it didn't look like an inspirationary Rangers.
The Rangers are currently in the sixth place, but Rividington went to the third place after the hibernian score.
Also, the fact that the jury's column Spence had to throw something from the passenger's seat on the highway and get a wound on his head, it could be more trouble facing the rangers.
Gerard has come to this match by changing eight members when he broke Eur and went to the Beatred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt maintained the same ibn when he took the point last week.
The Rangers have won their property rates, but Liberington has been more successful with less postures.
Just two days after the start of the Menga's first pass, Mid-Fidder Scott Pittman set a goal to protect Alan MacLegger, but he took off his side and left a decisive opportunity.
After that, the general, Craig Harkett, received a free kick in the Pernal Area of Kegan Jacobs, and Alan Lisgo of Difender shot a shot but hit a backpop.
The Rangers controlled the ball, but they ended up playing with hope based on observation rather than on play with confidence in the finals.
Colombian Alfred Moreros argued Petality when he collided with Steven Lorelez for 15 minutes, but the judge of Stephen Thomson turned off Moreos' apes.
The Rangers gave two shots in front, but the former rangers, GKria Kelly, saved Lassana Krival's hair without difficulty the monotony of Obiye Egyria.
The first half of Rivington was against the flow of the game, but no one can deny that it is also a gift from hard work.
Even here, the Rangers couldn't deal with Jacob's setup in the Pernarty Area.
Descendant Garr passed Scott Robinson, Robinson sent a route to Megan calmly, and Menga decided the goal was easy, but Scott Arfield couldn't handle it.
Jellard turns Ryan Kent into a Clever in the Harftime, but this soon worked, and Winger Krie sent pathways to Moreros, but Kelly blocked the ball at the finish line.
But Rividington took the game out of his own best-speed games and handled the long balls that were then sent to Lisbon and Hartett in succession.
The starring Rividington had the opportunity to stretch the lead at the end, but Jacob's shots were blocked by Macregar's favorite suite, and then the Lisbon Heddting from the corners were left side by side.
Glen Mildton of the Rangers who were on the way, offered his petality when they were involved with Jacobs, and here Tomson left it.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
Today's Morning page, Almanac: Today, 30,136 years ago, a future physicist, Johns Villem, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a device that was eventually known as the Geiger counter, to detect and measure radiation.
Since then, the chief authority of science, Guyger Counter, has been the driving force of pop culture to be seen in the 1960 Colonand's movie of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who had unexplained a cowboy scientist.
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "The Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
It is possible to have a earphone to actually hear the effect of an atom emitted by the radiation in the mineral."
I'm not going to be able to do that.
Hans Guyger died only a few days before his birthday in 1945, 63 years.
But the invention that crowned his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect incorrect cells.
The new cancer vaccine can tell the immune system to kill.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize defective cells as a form of treatment.
It's a way of extracting immune cells from patients and adding changes in the laboratory.
This allows the cell to have more common proteins so that it can reinject them.
Test vaccines show the promiscuous results of cancer patients in a wide area.
In the case of women who received a vaccine to teach them to recognize defective cells in their immune system, the ovaries have disappeared for more than 18 months.
In this way the patient extracts immune cells from the patient and then adds them in the laboratory to make it possible to identify proteins that are common to many cancers called HER2 and then reinject them.
Professor J. Belsovsky of the National Cancer Institute in Besseda, Maryland, said: "The vaccine has been shown in our case."
HER2 helps grow a number of cancers, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung cancer, and large intestines.
The same approach that we're going to use to teach patients how to remove immune cells and target cancer cells has been effective in treating leukemia.
Canye West used SNL to support the Tlump with his MGA cap.
That's what buys the reputation.
Canye West has taken a boom in 2020 when he says he's riding in the studio with the support of the Tunnel Night Live (SNL).
After West sang "The third song of the night" on the "The Ghost Town" May American Great Augin" (MAGA), he reiterated his support and backed up his flag against the Democratic party.
I've been talking to white people, and I've been told many times, "How can you like cards, he's a racist?"
But he said, "If I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago."
The SNL started with a film by the Hollywood Star Mat Demon of Bret Kavanor, a film evangelizing the Senate's testimony on the charge of sexual violence by Christi Braisy Ford.
Although West was not shown, social media uploaded by Chris Locke of Komedia.
I don’t know if Lock tried to laugh West on the post.
West also caused the crowd to feel uneasy when he struggled in the staircase for his hat.
"They hit me on the backstage.
They don't have to go out with their hats.
You've been bullied!
And Washington Eguessner says I'm in the deep.
And I'm like, "What do you want to see?" and West said, "How deep do you want to see?" and then he kept saying, "I'm going to woo Superman's mantle.
Then try your love.
At least two bakings from his audience, and the participants at SNL seemed to be confused, and one of the people there reported: "The whole studio was calmed".
West was invited to join his former rapper, Erica Grande, who died a few days ago.
West, wearing the Perry bottle costume, humiliated many people by singing "I love yit."
Campis Turner, leader of the conservative group TPUSA, supported West and tweeted: "Thank you for the bravest spirit: Thank you for facing the mob."
But the director of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just a "they' and they're great."
"But I chose not to give a reward for spreading harmful ideologies to my community (by buying his music, his clothes, or supporting his "art").
He's free.
"And she added it.
Before the show, Lapp announced that he had renamed on Twitter, and now he is officially known as Cannie West.
He does not follow the first renamed artist, he is also known as Pafdi, Pfeiffe, and Paddy.
My fellow rapper, Snoop-Rion, and of course the music legendary Prince renamed the symbol and also renamed it to the Artist known earlier as Prince.
An attempted murder charge at a restaurant in Belfast.
On Friday, a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast, where 45-year-olds were accused of murder.
Police report that the case occurred in Barry Haqqamo.
On Monday, the defendant will be on his way to the Belfast Court of Justice.
The charges will be judged by the Attorney General.
The star of the game of the Olympics, Kit Harrington, attacked the toxic man.
Kit Harrington is known as John Snow, a swordhead in HBO's violent middle fundraiser game.
However, 31-year-old Kit attacked a stereotype like this, saying this role of screening makes the boys feel that they must be strong in order to be respecified from their surroundings.
Kit said he felt that something was wrong with Sunday TimesCarcher, and asked how he worked on the problem of toxic manhood in the days of Metoo.
Kit, who married a collaborator named Rose Leslie (31) recently, admitted that she felt "very strong on the subject".
He said, "I'm not sure what we're wrong with manhood.
"What have we taught our growing boys about the problem we now see?"
Kit thinks that because of a very manly character, it might be a part of the responsibility for increasing the toxicity of the man.
He continues: "What's born is what's taught you?
Does it make them feel that they must be men of certain qualities because they saw them on TV or on the street?
I think this is one of the biggest problems of our time, but how do we change it?
As a young man, it's clear that something is wrong.
In an interview he also said, "War and horses are good enough," and admitted that after the end of the next summer, the game of Orb Sloughs would not be able to talk about the preceding orthodox.
In November, I'm going to show you the re-example of "Tru West" in Sam Shepherd's story of my brother's stealing from film producers.
He recently said that the best thing in the game of the people was to meet his wife Rose.
He says, "I've seen my wife on this show, so she gave me a future family and a life in the future."
Rose has played a video of John Snow's lover Igrit performing Kit in this fantasy series that had Amy won her award.
In June 2011, the two of them met at the home of a Scottish Leslie.
HIV/Aze: China reported a 14-% rapid increase in the number of new cases.
China has announced that the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS has increased 14 percent.
In the country, over 82,000 people are affected, says health officials.
The second quarter of the year 2018 alone reported about 40,000 new cases.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual intercourse and have been seen changes in the past.
In former China, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas as a result of infected blood transfusion.
However, Chinese health authorities at a conference in Nanjo say that the number of people infected with HIV has decreased almost zero in this way.
But in China, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 per year.
In China's LGBT community, sexual intercourse has become a serious problem.
While homosexuality has been legalized in China in 1997, it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is rampant.
According to the study, 70 to 90 percent of male gays are expected to eventually marry women due to conservative values in the country.
Many of the infections are caused by lack of precautions in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to have extensive access to anti-HIV as part of the issue.
Maxine Waters, acquittant of the faction's data leaks, and a conspiracy theory.
The U.S. Senate of the United States Congressman Maxine Waters denied charges that one of her staff posted an identity of three Republican legislatures on the Wikipedia page Saturday.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party claims that the claim is being carried on by critics and websites of the "The Super-Right":
"Throw lies, lies, vile lies" and Waters wrote on Twitter:
Reportedly, the leaks included Senator Lindsey Graham, elected South Carolina, and the two Senators, Mike Lee and Olyn Hatch, who were both elected in Utah.
This information was posted online by an anonymous person in Capitol Hill during a hearing by the Senate Commission on sexual assaults in the Supreme Justice candidate, Brett Kavano.
This data leak took place after the three Senators interrogated the Cabino.
The Daily Yomiuri reported that a conservative website such as Gateway Panduit and RedState found its original IP address in the Waters office and published information about the employees of Waters, reports The Hill.
"This unfounded claim is a complete lie, and it is absolutely a lie." "The water's continued."
"My staff, whose identity and safety were invaded by such false accusations, were not involved in the leaking of this information.
This untruth is a complete lie, and surely it is a lie.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online by the former White House press official, Ali Flycher.
"This denial is only anger, and Flyher wrote:
"This is what she did to the Congressman."
If you're accused of doing what you did, don't be angry.
Don't be arrogant.
Do not question the defendant's motives.
We have to act calmly and peacefully.
Fresher seems to compare the reaction of the Democratic party to the water reaction that he was too upset about the attitude of Judge Kabano on Thursday's public hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican Party's campaign to take the lead in the mid-term elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"If it was true, it's great.
In her statement, Waters says her office has contacted the authorities and police about such falsehoods.
She says we will do all we can to find out who's guilty, and she will carry the legal responsibility of my staff for having committed a destructive and dangerous act.
"Johnny Insurance Reverses Analog" movie review of a lack of power.
Recently, a new movie that describes the decline of the UK appears to be going on with a brunt, but it seems that this series has been published as "Jonnie Inlish" and "Jonnny Inlish" in 2011.
Could this ironic self-spoiled self-destruction subject us to how incompetence can afford a new opportunity to export to England?
Whatever the case, the incompetence of Johnny Innish, with his face like Gom, is repeating his demise in this work.
Of course, he's a stupid Secret Agent who misinterpreted himself for his refined charms, but he has all the elements of the character who played only the sound of the flames at Captain Kruz, Mrwin, and the London Olympics in 2012.
Johnny Inlish is based on a world traveler who is troublesome at Atkinson's show on a TV advertisement on a forgotten barcracket.
So let's say I have one or two good scenes.
When Johnny Inlish gets close to a helicopter with his middle armor, the rotor blade makes a sound like a helmet.
Although the gift of comedy, which holds out to the body of Atkinson, especially when we think about the fact that the "evaporative" film, such as 007 and Mission Inspecific, is being included, its sense of humor is very weak and clumsy.
It feels like a sense of humor, not an adult, and for me the extraordinary adventure of Jonny Inlish seems less creative and less focused than the silicon of a Mrvyn movie.
The film has been promising the present lasting topic of Britain’s serious problems.
Because the cyber hacker has infiltrated the British secret spy's web network and has revealed the identity of all British agents on the operation, our agents are wrought by the wolves.
The news had already gone beyond limits for the proud prime minister of the majority of the problems, but Ema Thompson has been doing well in the role of Teresa May, but he has no backing.
Her smart Adviser, whose identity has been revealed to be all the official agents, has to bring in a retiring spy.
That's why it's important to be a teacher of an expensive school, and also to be a secret engineer, Johnny Inish's survivor.

Ingrid and Boff have caused a lot of trouble as before, pretending to be a waiter, causing a fire in a glistening French restaurant, causing a lot of disturbance to enter the magnificent yachts of Volta, and in order to make sure that in Volta's house, Anchorish uses a virtual reality headhead.
While all the devices are on the last mountain scene, this dear Dothraki Community is generally a program for children.
It's quite ordinary.
And as I felt at other Johnny Inlish films, I couldn't help thinking about whether the British film industry could benefit Rowan Atkinson with his talent.
The Labor Party refuses to consider a plan that pays five days a week on four days a week for the public.
Jeremy Cobin's work party is expected to consider a radiative plan that citizens will be paid five days a week for working four days a week.
The party wants the company's management to share with the workers by adding more money in the AI revolution.
In the project, employees are expected to work on holiday three days a week while receiving the same salary.
Information sources say that the idea follows a plan of the party’s economic policies and plans for a country that will favor workers.
The transition to the 4th day of the week has been tattooed by the union's union as a way of benefiting workers from the changing economy.
"The revisit of the policy will be announced by the end of the year."
"It's not possible for a night, but the working system is the goal of four days a week to fit the approach of the party to adjust the economy to its advantages and to the overall industrial strategie of the party."
Since the Green Party vows a four-day workweek during the campaign in 2017, it does not support the idea for the first time.
However, at the present time, the entire Labor Party does not support that goal.
"The workforce is not the policy of the party, and they don't think about it."
The minister of the shadow, John McDonnell, has created a vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the last week's labor conference.
McDonnell said he'd be willing to regain power from a "no-managed" company and an "unnecessary".
The project of the Minister of Shadow means that the working party government has been able to “advance” because it recognized corruption and that the current sharer of the water company may not be able to recover the full share.
He also put laborers into the board of directors of the company, created a comprehensive property fund, put 10% of the private capital there, and made plans for the workers to receive a maximum of 500 pounds of distribution for the year.
Linzee Gram and John Kennedy tell us if the FBI can change their mind with the investigation on Qavano.
The FBI's investigation on the charges of Judge Bret Cabino caused at least a week's vote on the Supreme Court's demand to be postponed, and the results of the investigation suggest that the Republican Senator's support is in danger.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minitz specialist Scott Perry asked Senator Lynzee Granze and John Kennedy if they could find anything to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open to grams, a colleague of South Carolina.
Of course. Kennedy said:
"I said I'm going to the hearing, and I told him I spoke to Judge Kavano.
And I said, "Well, I'm not going to be able to do this, but I'm going to say, "I'm going to call him, I'm going to tell you this.
He was determined to remain clear.
But the ballot seems unchangeable.
"I'm determined on Brett Caverno, and it's going to be a lot of trouble."
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but Brett was very negative.
'I don't know,' said the Gryphon. 'and nobody could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I can't see new changes.
What is the global City Festival?
This Saturday this week, in New York, the annual music event, the Global City Festival is held.
In the seven-year-old Global Citys Festival, tens of thousands of people will be gathered to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardiv, Shawn Mendez, in Central Park, and to increase their awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citys Festival, started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Rights Consultation Organization, a global poverty project that hopes to end poverty by increasing people who are actively fighting.
The attendees of the concert had to complete a series of purposeful steps to volunteer, send, call to world leaders, and end poverty.
But after 12 years, how far has the Global City Festival achieved its goal?
Is the idea of trying to convince people to do their own thing with the reward of free concerts, to be honest, to sign an online petition, or to tweet it into something significant?
Since 2011, Global City says that since 2011, the Saporters have recorded over 9 million actions and are promoting various goals.
This action has been published to the world's leaders with more than $37 billion commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 250 million people by the year 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements that resulted from the action, and at least one billion of them were already paid or funded.
The group estimates that the fund acquired has been directly affected by some 640 million people around the world.
The primary commitment includes a co-contribution that helps children grow up to the greatest extent, including a power-powered Olympics, a partnership of British investors and management.
"By the support of the British government, funding, the government, the government, and the global Sicily like you, we can bring the injustice to the past during the live concert in London in April 1818, powered Opportunity Ambassador, Tracy Urmann, told the audience:
The group also reported that more than 5,000 actions have been made to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in Britain, and that the government has published a power-of-the-art initiative to provide food for 5 million women and children.
It's a website called "Do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
And we're not going to be able to do that, but we're going to talk about global Sicily, and we're going to be a long, hard way.
But we will have power if we come together, so we will be successful like great civil rights and anti-imparity movement.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendez, Cardib, Jeanne Monaee, and Deborah are the hosts of this year's events in New York, and the host is Davola-Lee and Hugh Jackman.
The United States will use the Marines to block the use of energy imports in Russia.
The U.S. government has declared that it can rely on the military in areas including the Middle East to prevent Russian energy from beating the market, and that Washington Egzamner has revealed it.
Zink claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria is an excuse to open a new energy market, especially when it comes to a legal government.
"The reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to interact with energy as well as in southern Europe."
According to officials, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States can confirm that Shirain is open with the Marines and can block energy from the market if necessary," he said.
Mr. Jink was speaking to the attenders of the events sponsored by Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that stands out as the "Evolution of Energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran with the fact that they are the same.
He said that the economic choice against Iran and Russia is to use less or less of fuel to replace the fuel, and that Russians depended on economic fossil fuels as a angular pony.
This statement was made in Russia, as a much cheaper option for European consumers, as an alternative to the export of hydrocarbon gas to Europe.
To that end, the government's official is trying to convince Germany to get out of the unfavorable Nord Stream 2-line plan, including the President of Tlump.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that the $11 billion Nord Stream, which plans to expand existing pipelines to double 10 billion cubic feet, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's strong rebellion against the project is just a economic one, and is an example of corruption.
"I believe we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to put pressure on and that consumers should be able to pick a provider."
Stans in the United States has called the German revolt, and Germany has reaffirmed the commitment to the project.
Germany's major industrial organization (BDI) asked the United States not to speak to two countries between the EU energy policies and Berlin and Moscow.

18 states and Washington, D.C., support the objection to new refugee policies.
The 18 states and special districts of Colombia support legal objections to a new U.S. policy that refuses the death of victims from gangs and domestic violence.

She was detained in Texas.
The state attorney who support Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are facing a broad issue of gangs and domestic biorens and are requesting a lot of refugees in the United States.
The new refugee policy in the United States overtook the 2014 migrant appeal court decision that migrants who were fleeing from the Domestic Bilerus were allowed to file their asylum without document.
Carl Rathorne, director of the Columbia Special District Attorney General, said that in his statement on Friday, the new policy would ignore state laws, federal law, and international law for decades.
"The federal law requires that all refugee charges be judged according to certain facts and circumstances and violates the principles of such hardy," according to a court adviser report.

The American Ambassador, accusing me of "advertising" in China.
One week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement that advertises the inter-American trade profits in the United States, the American ambassador accused Beijing of using American newspapers for propaganda.
The president of the United States, Donald Trumpet, denied the Chinese last Wednesday, accused China of trying to interfere with the United States Congress election on November 6, and then filed a bill of Chinese paper in the country's largest newspaper in Iowa, Demone Register.
The cards that Beijing was trying to interfere with the elections of the United States showed that the US government has a new phase of pressure campaign in China, as they told Reuters.
While ads to promote trade are common to foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are now in the middle of a trade war that will expand the same tax rate for each other’s exports.
China and the U.S. experts said that the country's retaliation tax in the early part of the trade war was designed to blow the country’s importers, such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Tlums, which is the lead part of the Trade War.
Terry Blanstad, a Chinese Ambassador and one of China's major imports for produce, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China's Branstad posted on Sunday's comments by Demain Registerer that the invasion of propaganda against our freedom of press has increased.
According to Branstand, the Chinese government is using the freedom and freedom of speech, the important tradition of the United States, to use the freedom of speech and publishing to spread the propaganda."
The media are under the control of the Communist Party of China.
"And one of China's most famous newspapers avoided posting my article," he added.
As a result of Kavanner's riots, an analyst warned that before the mid-term election, women-righted Communists were leaving the country.
Analists warned that the Republican party will be opposed by women in a later election.
Most of the Republicans are already hoping to vote.
In an article published on Saturday, Professor Grant Riller of the University of La Caches University's Department of Political Science said he can't go back to the past.
Professor Reiller said that it was doubtful that the Republican Representative of the Republican Republic of Arizona has promoted the FBI investigation at Gillii but enough to prevent the voters' anger.
According to a newspaper in Washington, D.C., women will never forget what happened yesterday or tomorrow.
On Friday morning, the Republican Party of Justice was shouting that the protesters will be coming in front of the Senate for the decision to proceed, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Brasley Ford.
Stu Rosenberg, a member of a non-consistative political journal, told the news site that the enthusiasm and motivation of the Democratic party will be inexhaustible.
And I said to him, "Well, I'm not going to do that."
But this could be even higher, especially if the young voters from 18 to 29 years of age are not very good with the president.
Analysts suggest that if the Republican were to go forward with the approval of Mr. Ford's public testimony that he had been sexually assaulted by the Supreme Court judge, there would be a reversal.
According to the NBC news, Michael Steil, former chairman of the Republican National Assembly, said last week that the uprising was causing a horrendous disturbance in the GOP."
Guy Seir, a Democratic campaign organization, has pointed out that it is not only the final vote to vote on the committee and whether Mr. Kabner will be named on the news channel, that the issue is how to deal with this riot and how to deal with her."
However, the American people are divided by which to believe in the testimony of Ford and Kabner, and it seems that there are several behind them.
According to a poll conducted by Yugava, 41 percent said that he believed in Ford's testimony, probably because he was 35%.
In addition, 38% of the time, Kabana said that it was probably a testimony, or that he was lying, and he became 30% of the time.
In the aftermath of Freud, the FBI also began to investigate Mr. Ford's testimony and the other prosecutors, Devola Ramirez, reports the Guardian newspaper.
Ford also testified that last week, when he was 17 years old of the Senate's Commission, he was violently assaulted by a drunken Mr. Kabner.
Ramiretz also testified to the presence of a Supreme Court judge who was at the University of Yale in the 1980s to expose the sex organs during a party.
Plans for the World Wide Web's inventors, the start of a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Bernards Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, created a start-up project that would become Facebook, Amazon, Google rivalry.
Inrupt is the latest project by Regent in the technology world, created on the basis of Barners Lee's Open Source platform, Solid.
The Solid has given users a choice where the data will be stored, which information will be accessed.
In an exclusive interview with the company, Bernards Lee released the joke that Inrupt's intentions were "world control".
I'm going to start with a little bit more.
This is a historic moment.
This application allows you to use Solid's technology to create your own personal online data store (POD).
This includes contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other professional tools.
This is available from one browser at the same time, like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify.
As a unique point of personal data stores, it is suggested that what information can be accessed is entirely available to the user.
Inrut calls it personal energies through the data.
According to Inrupt CEO John Blues, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills so that everyone can use Solid.
Information is now made up of the on-art developers and volunteer co-coder communities that have been signed into the project by Bernards Lee, Mr. Bruce, and IBM security platforms.
Since this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own variance type apps using the tools available on their website.
Berners Lee says he and his team are talking about the introduction of a complete change that will make the Facebook and Google business model all over again during the night.
"I'm not asking them to allow me."
On Saturday's media, Bernards Lee says that the mission is to provide commercial energy and Economy with guarantees of the new web's integratement and quality on Solid.
In 1991, Bernards Lee founded the World Wide Web Consolem at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and transformed the Internet.
Over the past few months, Bernards Lee has been making significant comments in online discussions.
Bernards Lee maintains his position as the founder and director of the Open Data Institution, the World Wide Web Consolation, the web funding, the Open Data Institution.
"I'm very optimistic about the next generation's web," adds Bernards Lee.
Bernard Van: A celebration to honor the Viktoric Crusades of World War I.
As a fighter, I won the Victorian Crusade during World War I, and the celebration was held in the town of my home for a hundred years, associated with the only Anglican.
The minister, Commander Bernard Van, won the medal on September 29, 1818, by the Battle of Belgren's and Lurkor.
However, four days later, he was killed by the Sniper, and he did not know that he was the best in honor of the British army.
On Saturday, a parade was taken in Rascheden, Northampampshire, and a monument was published by his two grandchildren.
Michael Van, one of his granddaughters, said that he was a simultaneous stone, and that his grandfather had been given the medal and that he had fallen into public for a hundred years now.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1818, Commander Van led a huge group of men to crawl through the extremely dense fog of Cantan through fronts, machine guns and fires.
Then, with a great brave hand, with a small gun, pressing back the front line, and slamping off three of the barracks.
Commander Van was killed on October 4, 1818, by the German Sniper, just a month before the war was over.
Michael Van, 72 years old, says, "I can't imitate him for what he did."
He and his brother James Van held a big celebration after the parade that was led to the Brentwood Youth Band.
Michael Van says that it was a great honor to participate in the parade, and that the courage of a true hero has proved by the support of a lot of people."
I've been looking at the Veratol 206, and I've only seen MMAFAN, Pepperpegg.
I want you to imagine how I felt when I couldn't see this main event, even though Veratol 206 was all night trying to see it.
San Jose's building consisted of 13 fights, and six of the main cards were shown at Chenner5, England.
At 6:00 a.m., during the battle between Mr. Ghagar and Rory McDonald's, the broadcast switched into the Peppa Pig.
Especially those who did not sleep until early in the morning for this battle were disappointed.
One fan posted on Twitter, "It's some kind of bad joke about what happened on the program for children."
“Daib Schwartz, the senior vice president of Veratur’s broadcast, says that it seems that he was forced to switch to children’s shows by a government rule that six a.m. is not good for hearing.”
"The Peppa Pig is good."
In the future, President Bellatur, Scott Kocker, is saying that in the future he will consider the schedules of British viewers.
"I don't know what's going to happen by the time we rehearse it."
"But it was 6 a.m. on Sunday, and I couldn't adjust it until Monday, this Saturday, the British Monday, the broadcast time.
So let's think about it.
So when the broadcast was switched off, there was a lot of text going around.
I've been trying to get back to work.
But that's not what we're talking about.
So let's say I'm not going to do that in the next presentation.
So we're going to have to cut down from six to five from normal.
This was a unfortunate situation.
Dessert Island Disk: Tom Dalley, Seksh-Artity.
The Olympic diver, Tom Dalay, grew up feeling that he was inferior to Sekash Areti, but that became the motivating process that led to success.
The 24-year-old Dalei didn't realize that she was different until she went to secondary school.
At Lauren Raven's radio 4 dessert Island Disk, where he spoke of Gayretz to give others hope.
He also said that being a parent has diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kasty Young, a spokeer for the long-term live show, has not shown up in the last few months because of his illness.
"It wasn't socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He says: "To this day, my sense of inferiority and alienation has always been a reality, and I have given you strength and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove something worth something to himself.
During the Olympics, the Dare player became a participant of LGBT campaigns with a powerful influence.
Darei says it's a good thing to live with her sequentially open and not be disturbed, so she decides to talk to others about her hope.
The three-time world champion Dareer says he fell in love with a American filmmaker, Dastin Lance Black.
The Dalley player married Mr. Black, one of the awards he received in 20 years, but his age difference is not at all a problem.
"I've been through a lot since I was very young, and he says, "Dalre players first joined the Olympics at the age of 14.
This couple became parents in June, and he says that all values have changed by the birth of his son Robert Ray Black Dalley.
He says, "If you asked me about this last year, I would have told you all about getting gold medals."
"But actually, there's something more important than Olympic gold medals."
The Olympic gold medals for me are the lobby.
His son was diagnosed with a brain tumor and inherited his father Robert's name when he died in 40 years of 2011.
The Dalley player said that one of the last words that my father left was that he had already made tickets to London in 2012, that he wanted to watch the front row.
"I couldn't say that by the time I was in the front row, I was no longer in the world."
"I was holding my hand until my father stopped breathing, I actually stopped breathing, my father died, my father was invincible."
The following year the Dalleys joined the Olympics in 2012 and won the gold medal.
"I thought this was all I wanted in my life.
The experience also led to an inspiration that led to the first choice of Dare and the Proud of Heather Small echoed with the development of his Olympics.

I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do.
The American Phil Mikelson player is about to launch a new record on Sunday 47th Raider Cup rivalry, but we need to revise the form so that this will not result in misfortune.
During this two-year event, the Mikelson player, who is about to record 12 of the most frequent excursions, was ordered by Captain Jim Furyk to join the captain forums and forums on Saturday.
A Mikelson player with five major major majors in the United States has been noted for his role, leaving the game behind and participating in the competition.
For him now, the driver is not perfectly straight, but the 48-year-old Mixelson player is not an ideal concept to challenge Le Golf National course.
The course itself is too harsh, but on the nineth day, it's going to be a fight against the open English champion Franco Morilinari.
If the United States starts 12 single matches while losing 4 points, it's the first time that the Mikelson player's game is just a decision.
Huurik put his trust in the Mikelson player, but he didn't say much.
"He understood what he was supposed to do today, and he smacked my back lightly, tied my shoulders together and said, "I'm ready tomorrow."
"It seems to me that I'm pretty confident.
He's one of the best players in the world, and in the past, he's a hero who's been in the hall, and he's done a lot of work to the team.
I didn't think he'd be playing two games.
I thought I'd play more, but I adjusted this.
He wants to get more out, as everyone else thinks.
The Mikelson player will be able to pull off the records of Nick Fold and record the most often on the Rider Cup.
So this could be the end of his career in the Raider Cup of Mikelson athletes.
But Fulik says that his existence has brought a mental base to the team.
"He's funny, he's a sarcastic, and he likes to make people do a little bit of a thing.
"I think young athletes are having fun dealing with him this week.
He brings me more than a play.
Captain of Europe Thomas Villon, I'm sure the big lead will soon be gone.
The situation is convinced by the experience of President Thomas Villon of Europe, who, from his own experience, has been a major leader at the beginning of the last day of the Rider Cup.
Mr. Biyo from Denmark made a debut in Baldama in 1997, a team that then led the U.S. to a five-point lead, which resulted in a small difference of 141-1312.
The photo was won at Le Golf Nanar, 2018, after seeing a team win at 5-3 on Friday, and last night, after seeing how the team lasted in Valdalama, it was a big lead in Burma.
And I'm going to show you that the history of this kind of thing has not ended with me and my team yet.
So I'm going to do all of this tomorrow.
We're just going to get out and do what we have to do.
The game is not over until the score is shown.
And the important thing is that we have a goal, and we have a goal, that wins the trophy.
I've been saying this for a long time, but I'm passionate about 12 athletes on my team, but I know what they are.
Bilon adds: "I never take pride in my team's performance on a difficult golf course:"
Tomorrow we have enemies.
I'm going to show you a little bit about what I'm going to do.
It's great to be with your friends when you're in good shape, but in private battles, all of your qualities are tested as golfers.
We have to send this message to all the players.
You need to get away from your peers this time.
In contrast with Mr. Beyon, Jim Furyk aims to have a more personal role than the team he will lead. The exception is the Jordan Smell and Justin Thomas player who wins three points per 4 point.
Mr. Fulik himself had been in both positions regarding the outcome of his fate's final day.
He said, "I remember a phrase clearly when I was asked about the last day of the week when Captain Ben Krenshaw called the player."
"There's 12 matches tomorrow, but we're expected to be expected to get a quick start of a rush like we saw in Brooklin and Medina."
It's going to be pretty cool.
We set up a strategy to fit in with the situation, and we chose people to follow our perspective.
The Thomas player is in charge of launching, and the top match is fighting Laurie Makii player, Paul Casey, Jastin Rose player, John Ram, Tommy Freudwood player, Ian Pooler, against the European powers above the ranking rank.
"I think it's possible to get the whole crew out of this way in this order," Bilon explained to him about the choice of singles.
Germany's new military, reprieved.
While the German navy was planning to renovate the Cold Warship, in 2014, the local media reported that it was impossible for them to reach at least this year because of the system's problems and the cost of expanding.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, an army spokesman, the start of the latest frigate ship of Valden Vultenberg, was extended to the Rhineland Faltz by 2019.
The warship was scheduled to be introduced in 2014, but after the post-traumatic crisis, ambitious plans were greatly lost.
The barden Vultenberg Friggate, which was launched by the Marines in 2007, is being used in the army in behalf of the Bremen Friggate ship that is currently deteriorating.
Verden Vultenberg Flygate's strong cannons, anti-air missiles, low radars, infrared synesthesia and sound signatures.
Other important features are that the maintenance cycle is a long way to leave the port and send the same frigate again for the longest two years.
However, the newspaper Die Zeit points out that the latest type of military ships that would play an important role in Germany’s efforts to show military might outside the country are going to be out of the country by the time of actual use.
F125FFflight on this trouble got a big news last year when the German Navy officially refused to move and returned to Browm Unut Forth in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the army to the ship company after entry.
Although the details of the reasons behind the return, the German media have drawn information that there were multiple "big software and structural defects" that would make military ships incompatible to combat.
The barden Vultenberg Flygate, a half of the men required a generation ago, was manipulated by about 120 Marines, and the lack of software was particularly affected.
Also, the Birden Vultenberg Flying Front is so heavy that the performance is reduced, and the upgrades that the oceans can be implemented in the future are limited.
The weight of these 7,000 tons of Rhineland Faltz is twice as much as that of the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also increasing in addition to the structural flaws.
The total cost of the project is said to have grown from the first 22 euros to 31 euros (36 US dollars) by now.
In recent years, they have been warned that the German Navy is losing power, and the issue over the latest Flygate is very important.
Since the beginning of this year, German MP Hans Peter Barters acknowledged that the army has no military ships with enough capacities to actually deploy the Navy.
The commissioner said the problem is rising with time because the old military ships are being stopped and there is no alternative military ships.
The commissioner also expressed his dismay at the situation that the Barden Vultenberg Fleegate was never introduced to the army.
Nationalist, the bat's puzzle.
A new study conducted on land in the highlands of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use land when hunting.
The study is expected to give new information about this unique flying mammal behavior and contribute to the further conservation activities.
In this study of the National For For Scottland researchers, they track the species of bats, sopranopisters, Browningers, Dorwintons, and other species in Invergaden, Westeros.
We set up a recorder on a major point in the compound and tracked the bat’s activities through the season.
Authorities and volunteers from NHS are also working on mobile searches using mobile detectors.
All recorded sounds are analyzed by experts, adding to the frequency of bats, and revealing what they are doing.
Analyses are based on biodiversity maps and reports.
NTS's Lob Duwar conservation adviser hopes to find out where the most vital habitat for bats is and how these habitats are used by different kinds.
This information helps us to determine the mechanisms of biodiversity management, such as the establishment of habitats for bats and related species.
In Scotland and all over the U.K., bat life has been reduced significantly in the last 100 years.
The bats are in danger of extinction due to construction projects that affect the state of the trees, and by the loss of habitats.
In addition to the chemical processing of insects and building materials, fire from pet cats and windmills and lights are risky for the bats.
The bat is not blind.
But because of the nightly process, bats have a more reliability to hear than they can see when hunting.
Using developed symphony, the bat captures worms at a pinpoint and recognizes the impairment of the flight route.
There are 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, over 76,000 hectares of assets in the country, and NTS is very serious with bats.
The NTS has ten experts who regularly do research, test the tree of a bat, and sometimes protect the bat.
NTS is also the first to set up a bat-only reserve in Scotland in Dam Flyers and Galloway, and eight species of bats live in Scotland.
David Thompson, a managing Estate, has found it an ideal environment for bats.
"This is the best place for bats."
"There's an old building here, there's a lot of old trees, all of which are part of a living habitat suited by bats."
But there's a lot that bats don't know yet, so what they're doing here and in other places can help you to understand what they need to do to breed them.
He's important to see bats before they do maintenance work, as he can kill up to 400 female bats and young bats in the land.
The bat is defined as a protected animal, and it is illegal to kill, abuse, interfere with, and cut down trees.
Elizabeth Felel, who serves as chairman of Scottland in the Kumoli Protective tract, asks for support from the locals.
He said, "There's still a lot to learn about bats in Scotland, and he really doesn't know how they're acting."
A lawyer is prepared to reject the charges against Ronande and to sue for his own magazine.
Christino Ronald rejects rape against him as a lie and uses his name to compel him to promulgate himself.
Ronald's lawyer has been preparing to sue for the German weekly magazine Dea Schpeegel, which published the doubt.
In 2009, this Portuguese player at the Forward of Uvents was accused of rape in a hotel in Las Vegas.
On Friday, he also announced that he also had a woman handing $375,000 and asking for a statement that he did not have the case.
A few hours after the article was reported, a 33-year-old Ronanud called news coverage for the 212 million followers of Instagram's live video "fake News".
"No, no, no, no, no.
"The news that the magazine reported today is Fake News," said Ronard, who has won Vallon Dordo five times in the past, to the camera.
And I said, "You know, I'm not going to be able to do this."
It's a lot more common than that.
And you're going to want to give me a name and give me a name for my magazine to know.
"I'm okay, I'm all right," he said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers have been preparing to sue for Dea Schpeegel and have just been reporting the magazine in a way that permits the space of privacy.
According to Christian Schultz's attorney, Ronanud is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years and has been charged with asking for a "a eulogy to find out how serious the violations are."
It is reported that the diligence incident occurred in the Las Vegas Park Hotel and in the suite room of Kasinos in 2009.
According to documents taken by the Clark Caterpirt in Nevada, Mr. Ronande and Marjounga were told to go to his room at a nightclub, where Mr. Ronanud raped Majorga's portal.
Mayorga says he was kneeling after the incident, saying he was a "99%" and was distracted by the bad part of "99%".
According to the document, Ronaud acknowledged sexual relations between them, but agreed.
Mayorga, too, went to the police and told me that he had taken a picture of a fugitive at the hospital, but then he was afraid of retaliating."
The 34-year-old Mayorga has now filed a call for a reversal because of the ongoing trauma of the prosecution.
This summer, while he moved from Manchester Uninitid to Lemadaide, Italy's strong Eunice Venice, he was moved by a euros in Italy.
Brigitte will be forever regretting losing his auto industry."
Greg Clark, the businessman, said that the British will be forever sorry to lose the position of a car manufacturer who drives the world out of the Blanket.
He added that if the British Tjota were to leave the EU without consent to BBC, he was concerned that he would stop the production at the Bernalton factory.
Clark Business said you needed an agreement.
The Japanese automobile manufacturer claims that if a break-in, without consent, the delay on the border will be likely to result in the loss of the business.
In the Barnaston factory in Toyota, 90 percent of the 150,000 books produced last year were exported to the European Union.
Director Marvin Cook of the Barnaston factory in Toyota said that if the UK were to release the EU at the end of March, the production of the factory would cease."
Hoda, BMW, and Jagarland Rover, as well as the companies in other U.K., are concerned about leaving EU without consenting to trade across the border.
For example, it appears that BMW has closed down a month after the BMW has operated a factory called Mini in Oxford.
The main concern of each of the automakers is the risk of the supply chain that occurs when the broker is unsuspecting.
Toyota's production line is based on the "Jast-in-time" and the Orderma car is used for parts that arrive every 37 minutes from the sapreer in the U.S. and the EU.
According to the automated industry on March 29, if the U.K. were to leave EU without consent, it could lead to delays in the border and delays in the arrival of parts.
Toyota cannot keep its stock in the Derbyshire factory for more than a day, so the production will stop.
Clark said the "Checkers Plan" that Prime Minister May offered his relationship with the EU has been skillfully designed to avoid testing on the borders that the industry cares about."
He said, "We need an agreement, we need an agreement, we want to make the best possible agreement not only to enjoy our current success but also to make the event a chance."
"It's not just a troyota, but another manufacturer has shown that we need to be able to keep the supply chains that have worked so well until now.
Toyota doesn't know how long it will end the production, but in the long run, more costs will reduce factory competitiveness, and eventually it will affect jobs.
Peter Zubaris, who works for 24 years at the Bernaton factory and represents the union union at the same factory, says that there is a growing concern among the union workers:
The government's spokesperson has offered a solid and reliable plan about the future relationship between Britain and the EU."
"The conference between Trinket and Rosenstein will be repatriated in the White House.
The High Level Conference, which is scheduled to be between President Donald Trumpet and Vice President Rob Rosenstein, announced that the White House could be delayed on Sunday for another week in order to continue the conflict over the Supreme Court case.
Mr. Rosenstein is an executive of special Agent Robert Moller, who has investigated the obstruction of justice by the President of Russia, connected with the President of Talk's side and connected to Russia.
For the last few months, the president of Talklan has been focusing on the welfare of the attorney general and the effect of Mora's independence on his superiority.
In the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that he had attended a meeting with a device to record a conversation with President Thunder, and it was suggested that he would be exempted from the president by Article 25 of the U.S. Constitution.
Mr. Rosenstein denied the press.
However, last week he went to the White House and reported that according to the report, he had resigned.
After this, a conference was announced on Thursday with President Talk at the UN headquarters in New York.
President Thompson Thompson said that he would not want to change his mind, and then he and his meeting were postponed because the Senate's judicial committee was overrun.
On Friday, Mr. Trumpet ordered a week's investigation of the FBI against Mr. Kabner's accusations that the voting in the Senate will be even later.
Dr. Thompson, a reporter for Trinket, agreed to interview Fox News on Saturday.
She was asked about the meeting with Mr. Rosenstein, and she said, "I'm not finished today, maybe this week.
It's going to be revealed in the future, and I'm always interested in giving you the latest information on the press release.
Some reporters will disagree with the statement: Sanders has not been doing the Pure Brefinig in the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked why.
Sanders told us that the few briefings don't hate TV reporters' stand play, while: "I can't deny they're standing in the street."
It suggests that there will be more opportunities for Mr. cards to get in touch with the press directly.
"The President of Tlump said he was spending a lot of time with the previous president, but he never showed the evidence: "I'm sure of that number."
'If Mr. Sanders had a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it would be much better to ask me questions.'
And you know that we're doing a lot of work to do this, and you've been doing a lot of work for the past few years.
When he leaves the White House to participate in a hosting public session and a press conference, he often asks questions.
But the single press conference is rare.
The reason has been expressed by the president this week by his unprovoked speech in New York and by his unparalleled appearance at the time of the meeting reporters.
A letter has been published to workers from the Scottish NHS who are uneasy about healthcare, Blaigt.
The Insurance Service has informed the staff of the country's appreciation for the EU working in Scotland's NHS and their desire to remain in the same office after the Brigand.
Six months after the U.K. has been released from EU, MSP Jean Frema has published a letter.
The Scottish government promises to provide you with the cost of living for citizens who work in public services already developed by the government.
In his letter, Mr. Freeman writes: "The British and EU negotiations with detachment have been followed during this summer, but we are expected to conclude this fall.
But the British government also considers the possibility of Nordial scenario and is preparing it.
And I'm sure it's time for all of you to think about it.
I'd like to remind you that all staff contributions are of great value, regardless of nationality.
My colleagues from EU and other countries have provided valuable experiences and skills, improve health services, and contribute to the patient and the community that we serve.
Scottish is certainly your home, and I hope you've stayed here.
Christion Abadronby, my head is wounded, and I'm in an emergency operation.
The Rhineback of Tiger, Tennessee, Christon Aklonbe player was reported as having been injured in his head and in an emergency operation on the day that Vanderbilt Komodos lost 31-27.
According to Tennessee's head coach, Rod Reed, the injury was said to have happened right before the Huff Time.
"He came to the sideline and fell there," said Reed.
The trainer and the medical staff took oxygen in the sideline before taking a Auckonbee player on a charge, and sent it to Strecher for a detailed examination.
The Tennessee newsletter told Chris Harris of the WSMV that the Avalonby player had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Tennessee's Nashville.
Harris added that he still has no idea how much he's been wounded and how serious he's been injured.
This was the first season in Tennessee after the transfer from Irisi, a second-grade football player in Red shirt.
On Saturday, he succeeded five taxis five times until he got out of the game and 18 times for the season.
The foreigner in Britain's real estate pays off the print tax, and the price goes up.
The foreigner buys a higher print tax in Britain's real estate, as well as a new one, Torie Plan, which will be used to support homeless.
Kobin was successful in collecting young votes, but he was expected to resist them.
The tax will be paid to people who don't pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Telecommunications Agency expects that it will earn up to $12 million a year, which will be filled with homeless support.
Today, Prime Minister Teresa May announced that the purchaser will receive a higher print tax than the purchase of British property and that the profit will be filled with homeless support.
Jeremy Cobin is successful in collecting young votes, but it is considered an attempt to resist the power by promising that he is to tax more than the cheapest earners.
The tax tax will be imposed on individuals and legislators who are not paying taxes in Britain.
The tax will be added to the current print tax, which will increase to up to 3%.
The annual agency predicts that this will result in $12 million per year.
It has been estimated that 13% of the new London stocks are being purchased by foreign residents.
The wealthy region of Britain, especially the capital, has become "gosstown" by increasing most of its time from foreign buyers outside of England.
The new policy was published a week after Boris Johnson proposed to cut down the print tax so that young people could buy more room for themselves.
He accused the big construction firm of occupying the land to keep the price high and urged Prime Minister May to eliminate the cheapest housing budgets in order to correct the British government's "criminal property".
Kobin has published a series of proposals that are attracting attention as rehabilitating the living room, including the suppression of rent and the extermination of "nocence".
He also wants to grant a powerful authority by the legislature to build a new home.
Prime Minister Mae said last year that I would try to rebuild the British Dream through the prime minister's office.
It's also the way we repair the ruined housing market in our country.
The British are always opening doors to people who want to live here, work here, and build their lives.
But while British residents are working hard, they never like the fact that neither non-government individuals nor foreign companies can afford to afford it.
For many people who want to have a home, this became a far away dream.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Jacques Ross, the boss of Sanderson, told me that one day he'd become the manager of the Scottish team on his ultimate dream.
The Scottish team 42 is trying to restore the North East Club.
Last summer, he led St. Milan to Scottish Premiership, and moved to the Stadium of Light.
"I wanted to play in my mother's country as a player."
"I got Bcap, but that's all I got."
"When I was a kid, I grew up with a Scottish team in Hamden with my dad.
This is an opportunity if you don't succeed in the club management, you can't get it."
Mr. Ross preceding Sanderland's manager is Dick Adfok, David Moyaz, Sam Aradis, Martin Oakes, Roy Keane, Gustavo Poe, and Paolo de Carnio.
Aloa Asletic's ex-husband's former boss said he's not afraid to name his celebrity in these famous clubs.
"To me now, my success is determined by getting this club back to Premier League."
The organization and facility of this club are without doubt because premierreg itself."
"It's never easy to get to that, but unless you're back in the club, you probably won't have succeeded."
Ross' manager has been working for three years, serving as Assistantbos in Danverton, and having a coaching staff in Hatz as well as a 15-month.
Then he restored Aroa to the third party, leading St. Milan to the championship winner in the next season.
Mr. Ross says it's better than the days he played in clyde, Hartruver, Volker, St. Milan, Hamilton Academik.
"It was really a different point of life," she recalls.
"I thought that management would be better than a player."
And I'm going to show you a few examples, and I've been able to do it well, and this might seem strange.
But playing is a tough one.
So let's do a couple more of these.
It's the same thing in terms of stress and pressure.
I've always wanted to work with management, and now it's happening.
The previous series of interviews will be broadcast on September 30, September 12:00-00-00 in a radio Scotland sports sound.
A survey revealed that the best time for drinking was at 5:30 a.m.
Britain’s pavilion is suffering from the troubles of its own, but it’s also pushing up the market because of the heat of summer, while this is a further burden for restaurant chains.
According to the study, sales in July increased by 2.7 percent in the pub bar and 4.8 percent in restaurants.
Peter Martin, a business consultant for the study, said: "The strong day of the year, which lasted for a long time in World Cup, England was expected to last June, which increased to 2.8 percent, whereas the restaurants were affected by the increase.
In June, the restaurant business dropped by 1.8 percent, but in July it was even harder.
And in the previous year's synchronization ratio, the pubs and bars, the main product of drinks, are the best in the Dants.
Even the pub, the main product, is not as good as the restaurant business, but it's suffering from the strength of the day.
And I'm going to show you a few examples.
Despite the fact that the sale of drinks in a chain of pubs and bars has increased by 6.6 percent in the last month, it has been 3% down for food.
Paul Newman, a Register Hospianian list of RSM, says: "The results have continued the trend we have seen since the end of April:
Weather and large social and sports events have a profound impact on the sales of foreign food industry.
It is not surprising that the management problems of restaurant groups continue, but it is especially painful to find that the sales in the previous year's synchronization ratio has been reduced by 4.8 percent during a sustainable cost pressure.
The heat in the long summers has come at a worse time than the food manufacturers have made.
The marketing of July in the entire pub and restaurants, including new jobs, increased by 2.7 percent.
Caféte Tracker monitors the industry sales of British pubs, bars, restaurant sectors, and collects and analyzes data from 47 management groups.
One out of five children has social media accounts hidden in their parents.
A survey revealed that one out of five children has a social network account hidden in their parents and teachers, including a younger child, 11 years old.
The survey was made with 20,000 middle students, and it found that the page of the fake Insta is increasing.
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
20% of the students are said to have a "main" account to show their parents.
One of the five children has written social media accounts hidden in adults, including one of the younger children, 11 years old.
The survey found that there was a rapid increase in the number of middle students' 'instastas' page.
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
At the same time, 20 percent of the students have a "main" account and secret account to show their parents to exclude unwanted content.
One mother happened to find a secret site for her 13-year-old daughter and posted that she was raped by another.
The study was conducted by Digital AwareenseUk and Independent Score (HMC), 40 percent of the students between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles and one was a secret account.
Mike Batchman, HMC chief, says: "Many teens want to create an online space that is not found by their parents or teachers."
Aleigh Doyle, the Scottish Asletic Commission, will be called "The Voice of Astrid."
Aylie Doyle was elected NonEgyptective Director at the General Conference of the Scottish Asletic Commission.
The Doilers are the most brilliant ground athletes in Scotland, and Chancellor Ian Betti said that for those who push the sports world, it would be a good opportunity to live with her experience on a wide range of international levels in the past decade.
"We are convinced that athletes in Scotland, England, and the World's Aslech community are being paid a great deal of respect and that by elected commissioners, the Scottish Aslech world can do a lot of good," he says.
I'm going to tell you this, and I'm going to tell you this, and I'm going to be serious about this, and I'm going to be able to help you with Scottish sports.

He posted on Twitter: "I'm having a stroke today a month ago."
I couldn't walk.
The doctor told me that I don't know how much time I'm going to recover.
It was a very difficult trip, but I was completely recovered, and I was able to walk again.
Thank you very much for sending me a message of encouragement."
It's an ad from a milkman who has seen his mother in milk milk, two minutes online.
Online, two opinions are cracked by a milkman’s milk manufacturer who has been feeding his mother.
Erby, the consumer's tech company, published an advertisement that was inspired by the comical music video when it announced the first cyberwe Arab milker in the world.
"I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, but I'm a cow's breast."
The chorus continues: 'Hipping milk, sucking milk, sucking it to the baby's milk, sucking milk, sucking milk, sucking a human woman'
This ad was published on the Facebook page of the company, which caused controversy online.
The video was replayed 77,000 times, and hundreds of comments were recognizable.
"It's a very wrong decision to use a cow's ad in this product."
And one of the posts was, "The cows, like us, have to be pregnant and give birth to their milk.
Elby's milker fits the breastbreeding brah (Elby/ Mother) without any notice.
The other comments say: 'This is a trauma for the mother and baby.'
"How about a human mother who doesn't take a baby, but she doesn't have a milk cow?"
And one of them adds:
Some defend this ad.
"I think that's a genius idea."
I think I'd still use it if I gave it to you.
Milk really makes me feel like a cow.
I'm sure the ads are just a little crazy.
"This is a great product," said one of them.
The other commented: "This is a funny ad for moms who think they're sucking (well in the office or in the bathroom).
It's not an ad that praises and criticizes the breast products industry.
At the end of the video, the women who were dancing show that they had been hiding pumps for Brager.
The campaign's concept is drawn from the fact that many of the nipples are like cows.
But Evie Pump does not speak at all, neither does a wire or a tub or a twig, so that women may be free to keep their eyes open and have their babies and even to get out of the sucker.
My mother's partner and Anavallin say: "Elvie Pump was an innovative product, and I think it was a bold and exciting sale.
A comparison of women's expressions with milk cows meant to attract attention to the milk and all the problems, to show an amazingly liberating feeling.
This is not the first time Elvie Pump has been pulled out.
During the London Fashion Week period, two children's mothers showed up in Ranway along with designer Marta Jacubski.
Hundreds of migrants moved to a tent camp in Texas.
The number of transgenders in one month has not changed relatively, but the number of migrants has skyrocketed, which is why some of them have difficulty entrusting their children to their guarantees in a terrible racket and policy of the Talk regime.
In the past, most of the assureants have been in the country's migrants, and they have feared that the application of their children could endanger their own stay.
The risk of the federal authorities being guaranteed in June and the other members of the family had to administer fingerprints, and the data announced that they would share with immigration authorities increased.
Matthew, a senior employee of the Immigration Customs Department, testified to the parliament that he arrested dozens of under-the-government guarantees.
The agency later confirmed that they had no criminal record of 70 percent of the arrests.
"Nearly 80 percent of the private members of the apprehended family have been illegally stayed in the country, and most of them have become criminals and foreigners.
So he said, "I'm going to follow such a person after all."
According to camp workers, the application of children was to be processed quickly, not by authorities, but by 60 days after their previous detention, but by some of them introduced new rules that required them to go to court within a month.
Many will be in a video conference instead of a man's court, and they will be in a legal position to judge the immigration authorities.
Anyone who is considered unqualified to be saved will be deported immediately.
In the last few months, according to workers in camps and reports by the internal authorities, the duration of child detention has been prolonged, making it easier for fear, depression, and thus violent and escape.
The defenders said that the size of a large facility such as Tornio has increased concern about the lack of evidence that children are facing difficult conditions.
Transporting children to tents without providing a period of emotional preparation and telling their friends to say goodbye added that they could make the already suffering trauma worse.
The Syrians ordered immediate withdrawal from the Fleet Army of the United States, the French Isles.
Warrid Al Mualm, who spoke to the UN General Assembly, called for Syrian refugees, even though the war entered the eighth year of the war.
Mualem, the vice president of the United States, said that foreign forces are in violation of the war against terrorism in Syria".
He said at the Führer: "At once, you need to withdraw unqualified."
He claimed that after 2011 300,000 people were killed, and millions of people were chased by their homes were almost finished.
Syria said it will continue this sacred war until the terrorist group and the illegal aliens are swept away from all parts of Syria.
The United States has placed 2,000 soldiers in Syria for training and training in the Arab Arabs and in opposition to President Ursad mainly.
France has more than a thousand ground troops in the country that has been devastated by war.
On the issue of refugee issues, Mualem blames that some Western countries are spreading irrational fears so that they will remain outside the country.
"We have called on an international community and humanitarian organization to encourage our return."
"What is to be purely humanized is political."
The United States and the European Union warned against the support of Syria's rebuilding until the political agreement between Assad and the conflict ended the war.
UN diplomats say the recent Russian and Turk agreement to set up the last key point on the idelib rebel forces has created an opportunity to promote political dialogue.
The Russians and Turkey agreed to avoid a massive attack by the Russian army that supported the state’s three million people.
However, Mualem emphasized that there is a definite timeline for agreement and that military action aims to eradicate the al Qaeda and the Zedharists, including the al Qaeda related to the Nura war fighters, are the targets.
UN Special Agent Stefan De Mistura wants to gather the first meeting of the new committee, made up of the government and members of the opposition, and to launch the post-war Syrian Constitution, and to achieve elections.
Mualm offered the Syrian government the terms to participate in the committee and told them that the task of the committee should be limited to revisit the right of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why the cards will be reelected.
According to the logic, unless many liberal observers were born early to the president, as you would probably expect, Mr. Trumpet would be re-elected in 2020.
No doubt it will be the most dramatic president of all time.
For now, there's no sign that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, CNN has increased by more than 550,000 people and more than 160,000 people in MSNBC.
According to Nilsen, Fox News has increased from 170,000 people a year ago to 24,000, and the MSNBC's Rachel Madaw has recorded the highest number of cable channels on the major news channels at night.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, and it is not understood," says Nil Bea, the "ABC: The President of Life" show at the "The President of Life".
There is another theory by Nelson Skoffel, a Beteran author, who wrote: “It's not a strong truth, it's "Sneaking in the ハリウッド Boys Club":
She remembers when she rode a taxi in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver said he'd vote for Mr. Trumpet.
She asked me why.
Skubel told me that the driver would make me laugh."
The confusion is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the story from the U.S. government determines whether the country's family will be able to reunite or not, as well as the health of the world economy.
Ignore is the luxury that only the most blessed viewer has.
Still, when the professional panels use "FEAR" in their book "FEAR", they spend a long time discussing the effects of a $5,000 masturbulous dressing jacket in Paul Mana Fort, and the insurrection of Mr. Ward's Trinket.

When Mr. Freis was contacted this week, it was 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the weather outside his northern shore of Kaui, but he was watching MSNBC in his house.
He couldn't leave in a situation where Brett Cabino witnessed to the Senate's Commission and no future for the Supreme Court.
He said to me, "This is the beginning of Western civilization."
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but I knew it was right."

External funding has come into the intermediate elections that are expected to be in contact with the U.S.
It is not surprising that money is flowing into Pensilvania, the 17th part of where the two parties are currently fighting the same session by the reconnaissance of Congress's parliamentary district.
In this recent election district outside Pittsburgh, outside of the recent reconstructural district, the Democratic Democratic legislature, Lam, has voted for another vote last spring in a special election.
Mr. Ram's opponent is Mr. Keith Rosfas, a former member of the Communist Party of Pensilbania, which overlaps the new 17th and a vast majority.
In January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania was recombined by the ruling that the old election district was illegally favored by the Republican Party.
The new 17th election campaign has been aggravated by the DCCC (DCCC), a funding of the Democratic Election Committee (NRCC) and the National Reconciliation Committee (NRCC).
Mr. Ram has gathered attention to the recent election of 18th Pensilvania in March and has become known in Pensilvania.
The conference lasted for more than ten years, and President Donald Talk was won at 20 points in the election district.
Political critics think that the Democratic Party is a little advantageous.
The U.S. returned to El Salvador, near China, after considering the penalty.

With a truck rented at home in Depot, Seppo (30 years old) attacked on a bicycle road along the Westside Highway in Lowell, killing a walking driver and a cyclist indiscriminately.
In order to justify the death penalty, according to the intention of requesting death filed in the south of New York, the prosecution must prove that Sepov deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately inflicted a serious injury.
According to the court's statement, both prosecutions could be put to death.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury prosecuted him with 22 prosecutions including eight murders, assaults, and car destruction, for the general threat of a federal prosecutor's case.
The prosecutor said that the attack would require a full plan and prediction, and he said that Seppov's murder was a vicious, brutal, and depravity.
"Sifro Hadra Ebibivich, jeezreel Angeli, Nicolaus Crebs, Dillor, Daren Drak, Armenian, Mendoza, Alangan, Al-Door, Al-Door, Aljandro Pagnak, and the loss of family and friends."

The conservative Party's negotiating the EU in England is a good deal for the EU.
Nigel Faraji declared today that he will mobilize the People's Army during the protest against the conservative Party's conference.
The former leader of the English independent party needed to feel the pressure of the euro skeptic because one of the senators of Mr. Terrysa May said he was good at negotiating with the EU.
Peter Bourne, the MP of the Conservative Party, said that if Falamazi had been the Minister of the European Union, he would have left England by now.

Congressman Welingboro said, "I'm backing up EU, but checkers must stop."
"I'm going to argue against the EU." "I'm not going to be able to serve in the war of World War I.
We want to have our own laws.
Mr. Bourne singled out the idea that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016:
The conservative EU EU, Andrea Jenkins, participated in the reunion and told the reporter: "I'm just saying that I'm just saying.
"Checkers are popular with the common people, they don't vote, they don't vote, and some activists who have actually turned the streets and won the elections."
Checkers take it down, and I want you to listen to me.
With a message directed to Mr. May, the Prime Minister can stay at his position when he defends his pledge.
Faraji said that if you fail to violate your 2016 national vote, the politicians who participated in the assembly will be "responsible to the pressure".
"This is a matter of trust between us, our people, our political class," he said.
"We can't admit it now because they're trying to betray the EU."
"I want you to feel pressured by the political class that is trying to betray EU.
"Neither rest until the proud U.S. has mobilized the nation's legislative forces that have led the EU to victory.
Meanwhile, the Residents marched on Birmingham and held a two-hour meeting in the city's center.

Another black one?
Prosecution of a couple who fired after a racist text in New York.
New York's babysitter charges couples that they are discriminated and falsely sent by their mother, and after they received a text dissatisfied about themselves.
They called the case a “strong act” and denied it to be a racist.
Lindsey Polyco Flaxman, a mother of two, became confused and learned that Giselle Maurice, a new babysitter, arrived on the first day of work in 2016, was black.
"Noah, nohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
But the text was not my husband, nor was it sent to Mr. Morris twice.
According to New York Post, "after his failure", Poko Flaxman, who quit the past, said that the African-American babysitter, who expected the Philippines instead because of poor work quality, had fired him.
Mr. Maurice received a full day's payment and returned to his home in Uber.
Once, Maurice accused the couple of being fired and did not have a contract, but he asked for $350 a day, and six months a day, when they worked in their original home.
"I want to tell them I don't want to do this," she said to the Post on Friday.
The couple denied the accusation that they were racist and claimed that they had no trust in Maurice after making Maurice uncomfortable.
"She sent a text to her, but she didn't mean that.
She's not a racist.
"We're not racist."
"But, for example, even if you were wrong, can you leave your children with someone whom you have been rude?
Did you have a new baby?
I can't.
To make the case look like a "struggle", Poko said that she had only been giving birth to a baby for two weeks, and she had been in extremely difficult situations."
"Are we going to do this to people in such a difficult situation?"
It's not a good thing to do.
While the case is going on, the public opinion of the court is quickly spreading, social media condemns the couple, and their actions and logic are being rushed.

Before writing a little bear toy, her father, who had been working as a photographer in BBC, said that he would have been optimistic, even though his job was not accepted, and that the 60th anniversary of his death was "viterweet".
She says Paddington was part of our most important family, and added that her father was silent and proud of his ultimate success.
"He's a very quiet man and not a man to talk to," she said.
"But Paddington was very real to him, so I felt like I didn't do anything, especially if I did anything.
My father had a sense of success in Paddington.
It was his creation and inspiration, but he always praised Paddington himself.
My daughter was on the ground of death, and I had to say good-bye over the phone.
I landed, and her daughter was dispatched to Lei Passer 2.
"It's very dangerous, and Nadd was calling many times to say she won't help."
"And Nad, on the phone, said she'd be dead in two minutes, to say good-bye."
And I'm telling you.
I said, "I love you so much, baby."
I'll be right there.
I'll be right there.
The doctor was slowly removed from her heart, and she was stopped.
She was already dead, and this is all stopped.
I just sit there waiting and know everything's going on.
I was surrounded by many of my family's brothers and sisters, so I couldn't sleep, scream, or cry.
I had to put up a hard fight.
During the grief of losing my daughter, Edinan Lappers, in time, had to fly side by side with other passengers to endure the situation.
"I didn't know anything about it," she said.
"I fell down, and there was a tear in my head.
It's hard to explain, but it was the flight that made me feel this unbearable sadness for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
He really loved his daughter.
A sad woman put a card on the bridge to prevent suicide.
Two women who lost loved ones in suicide are working to prevent the attempt to destroy their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hoffrey keep track of the number of phone numbers they can receive and support on the Welsh Bridge.
Daviz's son, Tyler, suffered depression at 13 years of age, and at 18 years of age, gave himself up.
"I don't want any of my parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45-year-old who lives in Ridney, said that her son had a beautiful, promising future chef.
"We all knew his smile."
They all said his smile would be brighter in any room."
But he's really in the dark, and before he died, he went to work.
In 2014, my brother Tyler, a 11-year-old brother, discovered his brother's death.
"I'm worried about what's going on in chains."
I'd like people to know that even if you're friends, you're people who talk to you.
Don't leave me in silence, please speak to me.
Ms. Davis and his friend, Mr. Humphreys, lost her 15-year partner, Mark, from the death of his mother.
"He didn't say anything, either, that he was depressed or was down."
And he said to me, "You know, I don't know what I'm talking about."
He was very depressed on Christmas day.
She said that his death had become a big trauma to her children, but only to overcome it.
I'm going to split up.
But we all have to fight with this.

The FBI has launched an undetectable investigation into the future of Brett Kavano.
I thought if we were able to have what he was really asking for, we could be a little tied up.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanner and his Republican supporters prefer to investigate the FBI?
All their trance is a matter of timing.
The intermediate election was about five weeks ahead of November 6, and if they were to become disappointed with the Republican Party, as expected, they would be very weak in selecting the people who were elected to the Supreme Court of the United States.
George W. Bush called the Senate and pressured him to support his wife, Ashley, who worked with the White House with Mr. Kavano and Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI created the report?
votes will begin in the Senate of 51 Republicans and 49 National Democrats sitting in seat.
It is not yet obvious whether Mr. Cabino can win at least 50 votes in the Senate, and it will crush the same number, and will allow him to be admitted to the highest court.
North Korea's exiles have been reduced under the Kim regime.
South Korean legislatures said that after Kim Jonund seized power seven years ago, the number of exiles to North Korea had decreased, saying that it was the number of people who had been exiled to Korea.
Pak Bingzig, who quoted data from the Ministry of Union, said that last year there were 11,127 people, compared to 2,706 deportations in 2011.
He said that the highest rate was due to the stronger border management of North Korea and China, which is the main reason for the high rate of intruders.
Pyungyan has not published public comments.
Many of the exiles from the north have been given citizenship in Korea.
Seoul says more than 33,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the battle in 2003.
Many of them have the longest border between North Korea and North Korea, and they are running through China more easily than the non-military borders that lie between North Korea and North Korea (DMZ).
China considers exiles more illegal than refugees, and many of them are forced back home.
The relationship between the North and the South has been significantly improved in recent months.
In Piungan, the leader of two countries in the head of this month, who met in an interview focusing on nonnuclear negotiations that had been suspended by two countries.
This has been followed after an extensive agreement between President Donald Trumpet in Singapore and the Historic Conference in Kim Johnn, Japan.
But on Sunday North Korea’s foreign minister Li Yonjo blamed the U.S. sanctions that have never been developed since.
“There is no confidence in the country's safety without trusting in the United States, and under such circumstances we will not enter nuclear one at a time,” Li said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Perrose told Blett Cavalauauau. He was wrong in his office of the Supreme Court of Justice.
Nassie Perrosi, the Prime Minister of the Minor Party, called the Supreme Chairman, as "hysterical" and said that his temper is not inappropriate for following the highest court.
Peroshi commented on the interview on Sunday at the Texas Tribian Festival, held in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman behaves like a hysterectomy, she's not going to be able to think she's going to be described as a hysterical."
Cabino emotionally denied Dr. Christine Braisy Ford the claim that they had had sexual violence during the time of the Teenager.
During his premium, Cabino was very emotional and sometimes seems to be yelling or closing words between his family and his high school debates.
He also made a clear accusation of the committee's National Democratic party and called it "a dismay of a disfavor taken by the Liberals who were angry at the losing of Hillary Clinton in 2016."
Perosi's testimony convinced him that he was unable to conduct the Supreme Court because of his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I'm sure he's not good enough with these statements, sir."
Peroshi showed a rough spot when he was asked if he was going to be shot when Qavano was approved, and whether the Democratic Party of the Council will gain a half of it.
I'll tell you-- if he's not telling the parliament or the FBI the Supreme Court, it's incomprehensible not only in the present court, but also in the existing courts.
Cabino is now the judge of the D.C. High Court.
Perovsi is considered a conservative trial, and she is concerned that Cabino might rule over health care reforms and cases of locomotives and Werdo.
Cabino avoided questioning whether he was going to subvert the Supreme Court's decision at his approval hearing.
"It's not a place where a hysterical and preposterous person is going to go to court."
And women need to do it.
It is a hard and reasonable charge, and years of anger have been unleashed, and she cannot remove it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry."
"I think it's not unusual, but what do you think?"
She kept saying, "I have been very helpful to some executive woman, and she was crying when she was angry, but when she started crying, she developed her technique and felt sad because I was crying at her side.
I'm angry.
And she just kept crying.
And I thought, "You know, I'm going to have to do this."
Tears are not fundamentally understood, so a part of their anger is recognized as an excuse.
One of the clear memories of the old man's office, when I was crying out with bitter anger that I couldn't express, was dragged down to the end of the stairs by a woman with a cold manager who was a little afraid from day to day.
"Do not show them tears." she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad you fell down.
Patricia Schleider, then a member of the Democratic Democrats from Colorado, was active in the election of Gary Hart.
In 1987, when Hart was experiencing an affair called Monkey Business, he resigned from the election, he felt very sorry and wondered why he couldn't have a plan to vote for the president.
"It wasn't a good decision."
"The election has already had seven other candidates, and the last thing we need was one.
Someone called me Snow White and Seven little boys.
Because it was late for her to start the campaign, and she was not enough to raise her money, so I vowed that she would not leave without two million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
Her supporters found that even though they gave the men 1,000 dollars, they only offered $250.
'I don't know,' said the Gryphon.
When she gave a speech to show her no formal campaign, she expressed her appreciation for the people who supported her, to raise money and to target the voters instead of the delegates, to a very difficult system to drive, to anger against women, and to break down words.
"You thought my nerve was debilitating," recalls Mr. Schroeder how he contacted her.
"I thought Krenex was my sponsor."
I remember thinking about what words are written on my tombstone.
"Sleep bug"?
And I'm going to tell you about the future.
Experts say that trade wars between the United States and China are open in a uniform attack, while the end is still too far to end, but two cracks may benefit Beijing in a long time.
President Donald Trumpet warned earlier this year by taxing taxes on major Chinese imports, including solar power panels, steels, and aluminum.
The biggest customs tax this week has been taxed by a new tax of 20 billion dollars and is actually taxed to half of the products exported from China to the United States.
Peking retaliates exactly the same city, taking taxpayers from 5 to 10 percent to 6 billion American products.
China vows to be against the United States every time of its capital, and the world’s second largest economic power is not ready to drop.
While surrendering to Washington means surrendering, the public obedience to the United States is a great humiliation for the Chinese leaders' learning in the near future.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing handles the card correctly, the pressure of the U.S. trade war can backfire China in a long time by suppressing the two interdependences of the two economys.
"The fact that the early political decision by Washington or Beijing will lead to economic turmoil in both countries is more dangerous than the viewer had ever thought."
Minister of foreign government, we are ready to return to refugees.
Syria is ready to help rebuild the country that has been devastated by a seven-year war.
According to the UN General Assembly, Warrid al Mualm said the state has improved.
"Today's struggle with terrorism has made the situation on earth more stable and safe."
The government continues to repair areas that have been broken by terrorists to recover the body.
All conditions are now being prepared for refugees who have to flee for terrorism, for their daily life, and for poor economic measures to come back to their country.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the war in 2011.
The other six million people are still in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Malem said the Syrian regime welcomes support for rebuilding countries that have broken down.
However, he stressed that the support of conditions and the support of countries that support the civil war will not be accepted.
The Europeans have won the Rider Cup in Paris.
At Le Golf Nanar, outside Paris, France, they suppressed the U.S. team, and the European Union team won 2018 Rider Cup on the final score 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States is currently recording a series of six battles in Europe and has not won in the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe has recovered its crown at 14.5 points, where the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team has reached 14.5 points necessary to defeat the United States.
American star, Phil Mikelson, was almost jammed up in the tournament, dropped a Tskelson shot in the 16th Hall of Par3 and admitted to Franco Molinary his game.
Italian golfer, Moraniari, is shining in all his rounds and is one player out of four aimed at 5-0-0, the current format of the tournament in 79.
The American Jordan Smell lost five and four European teams' worst-run player, Talbian Allen, in Denmark.
The highest ranking player in the world, Dastin Johnson, dropped two and one into Ian Palter, England, who would have played the last fight in the Raider Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who was at the eight-developed Rider Cup, became the most successful European tournament at a career of 25.5.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't do anything today.
It's been a very long year.
So, I'm grateful that Thomas chose to believe me.
I'm so happy. I'm really happy to get back the cup.
It's a team, and it's a great privilege to contribute.
He's a member of his family, and he gave John Ram to the legendary Tiger Woods of the U.S. Golf world, which broke two and one in the singles on Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride to win the Tiger Woods, and I grew up looking at him."
Waz lost his entire game in the foie in France and recorded his 13-21-3 career in the Rider Cup record.
Only Jack Nikos is the weird statistic of one unfamiliar player winning 14 titles.
The US team, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tonny Finau, who played the quality of the tournament during the weekend, was worried about looking for Fairway for the weekend.
I'm proud of the team they fought.
We talked about Europe this morning.
We fought.
To Thomas, we must honor him.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played well.
We're going to set up a team again, collaborate with the PGA and the Rider Cup Commission in the United States, and move forward.
I like these 12 people so much and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to throw away your hat.
We have been overcome.
Red tide updates: Pinesas, manatei, Salasota's lower concentrations
The latest report from Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that part of the Tanpa Bay area is slowing down the Red tide.
According to FWC, the conditions in Pinella, Manati, Salatta, Sharonte and Collier groups have been reported on the conditions of the pasturage.
Red tides spread about 30 miles from northern Pyreascatati to the southern coast of Reykungi.
Patch can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborocatti, but it can be found in a few places compared to last week.
Red tides are also being observed in the past.
