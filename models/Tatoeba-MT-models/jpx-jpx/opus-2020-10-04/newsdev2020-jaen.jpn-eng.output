Croatia's planning a nuclear operation. Bosnian protest.
Hundreds of people gathered in a town in the northwestern part of Bosnia and protested to plans for the neighboring Croatia to store some of the wastes from the only nuclear power plant in the region, which is beautifully known near the border of Bosnia.
Participants at the town of Novi Grade in Bosnia were very determined to save the remains of Turkovska Gora's munition to Croatia and vowed to fight it.
It's going to store waste from the nuclear plant in Krucico.
The Bosnias who held the banners, "Do Not Take a Healthy Future", such as "The River Needs Us," said that the nuclear disposable facility could threaten the lives of some 25 million people in the U.N. and around it.
We have to oppose them.
Novi, chief of the Grade, Miroslav Duraka said to the crowd:
We must fight to protect our lives and our rivers.
"The Kresco nuclear power plant, started in the '980s, is located in Slovenia and is shared with Croatia.
Both government officials are planning to negotiate next week and discuss the development of the waste disposal facility.
Croatia's national broadcast reported that Croatia should build its own storage facility on Friday, or that Slovenia should not be paid for the waste of Croatia, which is being processed in the newly built facility.
The Minister for Environmental Protection Energy in Croatia, Tmilo Love Chochi told Ananias that Croatia has problems with school, hospital, and public disposable treatment from prison, and wants to have a full-responsible solution.
In Bosnia, the activists and actors and residents of all ethnic countries have claimed Croatia to find another location on the side of the nuclear plant near the nuclear plant.
"Why would the Bosnia's pants pocket be the best place in all Croatia?" Dura asks.

We're going to go to the Daily Telegraph, and we're going to go through the DePay Business Man, and we're going to talk about the Creative Remedy Wave that's going to come in.
The initial tax tax tax tax tax, starting from October.
This is what we're going to call Cashless Point Retrieval.
It's called Cashless, which is the maximum return of 5% to suppress the cooling of the consumption.
Before the taxpayer's taxpayer, the shops and businesses are invading the cacheless.
So what's going on is, it's introductory.
So let's say I have a cash register.
We're stuck in the scene of the introduction.
▪ Introduction before taxpaying, shops and merchants are rushing into cashless.
I'm an old man.
More than a hundred kinds of candy are lined up in popular shops run by bamboo brewers.
This day's visit was made by Sumaho Final Service of PayPayyy, which boasts a total of 125 million users.
Is there any other way to pay for your account now?
The President of Takashi Takami is saying: "No, I'm dealing only with cash.
I'm sure it's easier to get cash if you're used to it because you don't have to pay for money.
A billion-dollar campaign has been launched at a point where 20 percent of its use has been returned.
We've been adding more users to the explosion, but Takashi is the user's user use, which means "PayPay introduce" to the store.
I've been a cash business.
The president has heard from Yamada and has decided to join PayPay.
I'm really busy now, and I'm sure you're good at it, but if you've never been able to talk to the consumers before, or you can talk to them at PayPay, you've got a contractor now on the wave.
▪ In the nation's consumer return business system, we're going to take Cashless Wave!
It's the nation's Rescue Business.
It's a 10-year-old year-old consumer, and it's a ten-year-old tax tax tax, and we're going to introduce a system that will restore up to 5% of the biggest shops to consumers to prevent the cooling of their consumption, but that's the condition of Cashless Repayment.
There are not many small shops in the middle who think they're going to introduce cashless payments in advance of taxes, like the 'big shop'.

The talk show tells about Fukushima's betrayal of the 10-year-old Roke.
In the town public office next to the hall, I also show pictures of the horsemen of Yamada Higashi-san, and old cars that Fukushima drove in the theater.
What's the substitute Munichhausen syndrome in the Internetflicks The Polytician?
Symptoms are false that parents and parents are sick.
The Polytician is broadcast online today.
The drama is about Paigon Hobert, the president of the United States, but first of all, it's the first step to become head of my high school.
The film was produced by American horror stories and Griley’s producer Ryan Murphy, and the show is Gwenness Partrow, Ben Platt, and Lucy Bointon.
I don't want to be as negative as possible for those who still don't have the opportunity to see the drama, but I can also tell you in the drama how the pro-Munhhunhazen syndrome is -- this is a mental illness that seems to be a physical or mental illness, even though the guardian is not really sick by the person under the protection.
While there are various kinds of diseases, there are also Munichhausen syndrome, which lie that they are sick themselves.
But the provincial Munihunhausen syndrome is clearly false that others under their protection are sick.
It is also known as FI, a forged or abductive disease, and is also a form of child abuse.
In rare cases, it is common for parents to exaggerate the symptoms, cause the symptoms, cause the child to become ill.
So, what are the symptoms of pro-Munihausen syndrome?
While signs of disease change in case cases, NHS considers such matters as:
Children seem healthy, but they try to put a doctor down when they're sick.
Explosive or false.
The results of the test are designed by children to believe that they are sick, such as mixing sugar into a diuretic sample and causing it to become diuretic.
Excessive medications and other medications can cause a person to become susceptible to disease.
How common are the pro-Munhunhousen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is hard to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that 89 out of every 10 million people in two years had a disease.
What should we do if we are suspected of child damage?
You can talk to the community welfare institutions, or call the Children's Protection Line, NSPCC, 08088 800,5,000.
Nigeria: Police forced school in Kaduna, rescue of 300 children
Kaduna - Caduna police arrested seven teachers and rescued some 300 children yesterday in the Igabi District of Imam-Madbubu-Tanma, Imad-Banbar.
While the police say the children were in an unhuman environment, the school refuses to accept this claim.
"The people who call themselves the priests of the school," he said, "the people who call themselves Cheeves, who are the pastors of the school."
"When the parents signed a written agreement before they entered school,
Parents came to feed their children every day, and I know what environment they are in.
I was so surprised when the police came and evacuated the children, and they closed the school after their parents brought all the food they had.
There are parents who can testify to whether they had children in such a terrible environment as the police said, but this is an unfair treatment.
He adds that the former police chief, Abdullah, visited once to see what environment his children were in, but he did not complain.
And the children say that they have learned the Koran, and that is it.
However, the chief of police's public office, Yakuov Sabo, says that children will be reunited with their parents when they are handed over to the state government.
"In the name of being able to get knowledge of the Koran, they were put in an unhuman environment.
There was a scar on the back of a lot of kids.
He said, "I'm in the middle of a school, so I'm in the middle of a school to get to know the owners of the facility."

The Central Route is a turbulent, mistressed girl raped by a court of law against her victim.
In May 2017, a man wearing a rugged grilled galley suit pulled a 12-year-old girl back into the bush while he was climbing a school in Central Coast.
After that, the man turned the girl against a tree and added the sexual assault.
Shortly after the arrest, a house search warrant was executed, and the police seized a number of things related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, the man admitted to seven charges including the assault and the rape of another 11-year-old girl, sexual abuse, and sexual abuse.
When 12-year-old victims walked along a narrow road, they saw a man armed with a large tree stick and a knife suddenly coming out of the bush.
When the girl stops and stops, he puts a headlock on the girl and took her into a hard forest.
Men don't scream at a girl.
I said, "I'm going to have to hurt you if you scream."
After he tied the girl's hands with a blade in his right hand and tied her leg with a cable tire, he hit the tree and abused her for nearly an hour.
A man cluttered the cable, and the girl came to school crying out like a crazy man.
The man received a few e-mails and phones from workmates, but did not respond, and arrived at work around 9:30 a.m.
The man stood on his clothes with mud, grass, and trees, and had been assaulted by street violence, and he followed the driver to the bush, and he claimed that he had followed him with his bare hands.
The man's trial will continue on Tuesday.
Pope Rome, AI development is based on public benefit and is warned against representative of the IT company.
The Roman Emperor Francisco warned the IT company representatives, diplomats, investors, and others who fear the social injustices of artificial intelligence and other digital development will increase without the moral values of public interest.
The pope told a Vatican conference where government diplomats, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists, and ethicists met together.
At this meeting, which I called "The Public Benefit of Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops have also been invited.
The three-day meeting has become the latest evidence of the willingness of the Vatican to participate in future and dangerous debates in artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, there was a discussion about wartime technology development and the future of increasing machine work, as well as about the response of gun violence and social media companies in New Zealand's Republic of Climaxchi.
In his speech at the conference, he praised how machinery freed workers from danger and simple labor at the beginning of the industrial revolution.
But he warned them that if they rely too much on robotics for profit, they could rob humans of the dignity of their labor.
"If technology is the cause of the inequalities that are manifest, then it is not true progress."
If the ever-between technological advances of humans are against public interests, unfortunately they will turn against the kind of barbaric that is based on the theory of strong men.
According to the organizers of the conference, they want to take advantage of their expertise and post their future counsel on high-tech Catholic churches.

Leal Madrid won Osakana on 2-0, has updated the failures of the country's season, and has launched the top of La Riga ranking table.
But in this season, however, Djeineine Zidan has been subjected to a tremendous pressure in public dissatisfaction with the open war in La Riga and the Welsh Star athlete Garres Bail.
Apparently, the pressure reached its limit when Leal Madrid was humiliated by the Paris Sungelman (PSG) at Champional Reich.
But it seems that Jinedine and Leal Madrid have real talents, and some athletes are not in the current plan.
Vinis Juililor is one of the star players with such a Leal Madrid future and is currently playing on the team.
However, the other young Norman Martín Uudgor, who is incarcerated in Leal Sociida, has also been given an unusual Assist in La Riga war.
Martin Wadegor played in the Leal Sawéda v.A. fight, and as he looked out for Mikel Ollarsavalu in the predomination of Mikal, Leal Saigeda, he won the victory at 3-0.
Martin Uudgor, who got to the right, sent an outstretched path through the middle of the opponent's hip to the Olympics, and decided to take this exact spindle and take the goal.
For the second goal of Willian Joseph and the third of the great Olympics, the goal of Amarbes' Med Philder, the Manu Garcia player was determined to win the crushing victory of the Immannon team just five minutes before the end.
Martin Wadegor joined Leal Madrid in 2015 at 16 years of age, but he suffered a great deal of honor.
It seems that this Norwegian youth is now 20 years old.

I'm going to lose the accident of the Axelpedl!

I can buy security from Riznable.
A traffic accident caused by a driver's mistake.
The accident due to brakes and accelerations due to high-age drivers is on the rise.
I'm going to say that when you're in a hurry, you're going to be panicky, and you're going to be on a brake pedal, and the axel's going to keep on.
There is a new car with a safety drive support system designed to uncover such a driver error, but there is also a post-drug that can also be installed in unbridled vehicles.
Such a apartaporator develops and sells a speeding and prevention system.
I'm going to show you a little bit about what each one of them has.
Axel and brake pedal spacing are narrow as well.
[E-ACCEL ALARM] ["E-ACCEL ALARM"]
I'm going to make a mistake of the pedal, and I'm going to avoid it with the alarm noise.
The mechanisms, when shutting down or running low speeds, are caused by alarming when you stepped on the wrong brake and you need more accelerpillars.
It's also called acceleration, which causes an axe to react to the sound and to trigger the axe back and quickly recognizes the mistake.
Axel's tumbler has made it difficult to understand the sound of the engine and makes it more effective for older drivers who can hear and hear.

Accelerad detects speed signals and brake signals on both sides of the car, and slows down the accelerator by slowing down the accelerator.
When I was wrongly stepped on axel, I didn't give a signal from Axel, and I control the rush as soon as I got out of the crept.
It also has a function that detects about 5 kilometers/h or more of a car at a time (back) and forces the car to be transferred to a cleaner state.

Mothers who are rearing children have thought about the form of security for each family, and they've compiled awareness and demand for the government.
Kajimiya-san (32) is saying that three-year-old children who loved day care suddenly became anxious to go to nursery after the flood and remain at night.
“I want to prepare for disaster because adults are too busy to clean up the house and have no time to face it,” he said.
Shikimura-san, who spent the entire night in the shelter community with four families, including three-year-olds.
I told him I was going to take care of my surroundings when I was a boy who couldn't stay.
From 4 years old to 2 years of age, women in the center of Yokohama (45) were crammed around the house.
"I can't get away with five people, and I'm gonna spend as much time as I can in my house as I can, and I'm gonna have food and simple toilets."
"There's no right for preparation, and there's no need to change the preparations we need in family structure and housing."
A Kyoko, a 6-year-old and an eight-year-old boy, suggested that the primary school had an e-mail from her school the day before, but nurses had no communications, no e-mail systems.
There is also the need to build a system that can be shared in real time in the flooding roads.
"The weather has changed since before," he said, "the last time it was okay."
Tajima's representative said that the opinion "is going to be considered as a group and as a group".
Mr. Boris Johnson and a female businessman, Jennifer Archilli, have consulted the police department.
The police commissioner IOPC will now consider whether to take over the Prime Minister Johnson's case if the mishap of the London mayor is in violation of the law.
The DVR (GLA) announced that the director of the GLA had recorded the "comforts of the Prime Minister's actions" on suspicion that Arculi was being treated as a favor from his friendship with the Prime Minister.
GLA says that "the matter of action exists with information that may have been committed".
This isn't proven.
IOPC will now consider whether we need to investigate the matter.
The issue was entrusted to IOPC, but IOPC is the agency that deals with accusations made by Inland and Wales police.
The problem was entrusted to the police commission, because Johnson was in charge of the commissioner's case at the time.
Mr. Johnson denies misconduct related to his relationship with Mr. Archiri.
First, he claimed that he was wrong, but then he said he was going to follow the order of the London Parliament to provide information on his relationship with Arculi.
The statement was received in the Sunday Times, but it appears that in a report, an American immigration in London seven years ago was paid 126,000 pounds from the London mayor’s money, and Jonson and his colleagues were given three occasions to participate in a trade gathering of foreign countries.
Since then, the government has frozen a million pounds of subsidies to hacker houses, Mr. Archiri's company.
The company will be asked questions that puzzle you about the research process before the subsidies are paid.
The Digital Ministry, Matt Weiman, is in the Senate of Digital Sciences, and the company owns British phone numbers.
However, according to many reports, the numbering was transferred to California's office where Mr. Archiri is now located.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessman was a “public secret” among the employees.
The GLA movement that seeks to entrust the Prime Minister with the police department touched the wrath of the prime minister.
The government's authorities say this was a politically motivated attack, and that the night before the party was too late for the party.
"Advisor agencies did not file any evidence on any charges, and they were not given the opportunity to speak to the directors on the news late Friday night."
Both the people and the press will see the political rhetoric set in their hands.
Back then, the Sundad newspaper reported that the relationship between Johnson and California's businessmen with London's tourism and the Regional Industrial Industries was a “public secret” among employees.
Although the former staff of London and their partner (L&P) thought that at that time, Arculi had the privilege of sharing in trade conferences outside the city’s city's chief, Jonson.
A safety fund used by ordinary people to form property!
This is the 20th Fantastic Day.
I've heard about the future from President Tang Tang.
- "Work Fund" has been set 20th anniversary since August this year.
What do you feel now when you look back over the last 20 years?
And that's what we're trying to do.
I'd like to thank you very much for all the relevant things, not the history of "Work Fante" alone.
It's a fantasy that I'm starting to think about, "I'm supporting the common man's property structure."
This spirit has been follying for 20 years.
When people in general are dissipated from their financial concerns, the world will be brighter from the ground.
In the long run, luck doesn't have to be together with the benefit and the walk.
It's a very important thing to do.
I feel we've been understanding the message we've been offering since the day, saying, "We're going to support the companies we need in the world."
I think it's because the result has been a long fund for 20 years, and because it has been a business system that has been passed directly to many people.
And I'm going to give you an example of how much you spend, how much you spend, how much you spend, and how much you spend in the last month's report.
So, in general, we've got a black box of information about what we're buying right now, but we're going to open all of this.
And I'm going to show you a little bit more about what I'm going to do.
Mack Miller's death, the third drug-criminal arrester's keys.
L.A. (AP) - Last year, Mac Miller, Laper, was arrested by a third man in a drug crime involving the murder of his drug overdose.
According to the court records last September, Stephen Walter was charged with selling the fake pills of fentonyl mixed with oxycodone, before he oversinded the coke, alcohol, and fentonil, which he was responsible for injecting, and killing, but Fentanil is a powerful Olympic drug that has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of people in the United States.
Walter has been accused of selling drugs to Mr. Miller for offering another person, Cameron Pettit.
According to a court report released on Tuesday, Petit was getting drugs from Walter through August.
Lian Reibis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habbs City, Arizona, was accused of carrying drugs to Pett as Walter's deliverer.
Both three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, nor are they susceptible to each case.
Walter, currently in custody, was under surveillance in 2005 on drugs, and now five months in prison is already being handed down.
On Thursday, the first prosecutors in charge of the subject published by the Seleb site TMZ are asking Walter to be detained until the start of the public hearing is due to the very high risk of fleeing the country.
I didn't return the phone message to my lawyer immediately.
Petit is charged with the federal court of September 4 but the lawyer refuses to comment.
Miller's adjectives have been spelled out about depression and the use of drugs and have won fans as one of the great places in the hiphop world.
Miller, who is from Pittsburgh, his name is Malcolm James Maya Makomik, and his singer, Ariana Grande, had been in the first place in 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of the mirror that loved her instagram, expressing a tweet about it, "Samke Nexust".
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in connection with the modern Olympic drug abuse.
The guitarist Max Roberts of Lock Band 3-Ddown, who died of overdose in 2016, in his body was found fetonil and hydrocodone.
In this post, Walter's name was corrected as Stephen instead of Steven.
Nigeria's 9-year-old, mobile game develops over 30.
The nine-year-old is creating a playground game using a free programming app called Scratch 2.
Using Scratch Two, we can create games, animations, stories, and so on and offline.
Basil has used this application to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to conceal bats.
The players get a point when they catch a bat from a hiding place.
I learned how to build a game at a short-term focus course.
Basil said to CNN: "I'm spending time playing games when I'm bored."
In March, my father applied for a short five-day course for children from 5 to 15 years of age.
This course was introduced to provide kids like Basil to touch new technologies, such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to her father, Basil Okpa Silia, Bajjis grew up playing many mobile games.
"I was always playing a game with Basil, so I bought a tablet when I was four.
The candy crash and the Templar Rance did quite well, and the father told CNNN.
But after being reproved for all the games, at the age of seven, she became more interested in the game production of Basil.
He said, "I used to do a tablet one day, but I was so mad at the game that I got a little angry."
I was angry and said, "I'm always playing games, but why don't you make games so that others can play?"
I was angry at her when she said, and I didn't think Basil really cared about it."
Since then, Basil has been learning how to make his own game, and she has asked her parents to buy a laptop and have them enrolled in a course where they can start playing.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, has just named her games.
One of the games, Mosquito Matthews, can be purchased on Google Preserve.
The youth population in Africa is the tallest in the world and with the innovation of Africa, the younger group, like Basil, has taken control.
Two 12-year-olds in Nigeria have recently been awarded to a robot that uses program codes to clean up the house.
In May 2011, Akbot won a team of Ghanaian high school girls who programmed a boxed robot at Robofest competition.
An increasing investment of African investments for Google and the micro-socketing giant technology companies is becoming a future programming star for Bajjis and her children.
Former President of the Republic of North Carolina, guilty of false charges against the Ministry of Agriculture.
According to a court document file filed on Friday, the former President of North Carolina's Republic of Representatives is expected to admit that he falsely testified to the federal agents involved in the corruption of the main political entities.
In a list of court cases, Robin Hayes is going to make a false accusation next Wednesday.
According to the document based on the fact that Hayes' lawyer signed a plea deal, Hayes was aware that he was making false statements against the FBI in the interest of a bribe in 1818.
The actual legal document has been sealed, and Haas is notified in which cases are based on the facts.
Hayes was accused of collusion, bribery, and false accusations for the first time.
The prosecution filed that Hayes was involved in a plan of insurance chiefs in an insurance company that was about to offer a campaign to the state's president for special treatment.
Two partners at Greg Lindbergh and his co-conservatives have been accused of attempting to bribe the director of Mike Cozzie's Insurance.
Lindbergh is an Insurance and Investigator of the Investigation and Investigator of the Investigation and Investigation Company, who has donated over $5 million to the state and to the federal elections and committees since 2016, and has become the state's top political donors in recent years.
Lindbergh supported the Republican ideals and politicians, but he also made a donation to the Democrats.
They asked Lindberg's lawyer for Friday, e-mail, but they didn't answer.
On Friday, Hayes' attorney's attorney, Carls Davis, was asked by Email for additional comments, but he didn't answer.
The court documents filed Friday show Hayes lying to the FBI's agents in August 2018, but Hayes said that he never had a conversation with a member of the State Insurance Agency.
However, according to the document based on facts, Hayes was actually talking about people's diplomatic calls from the State Insurance Insurance Administration and the Insurance Administration.
The prosecution helped Hayes ask him to meet Cordberg and told him that he had spoken directly to the director about bribes.
In April, the prosecution released that Lindbergh was planning to seek special treatment for his insurance business and to focus on the 2020 election campaign aimed at Koszy's reelection.
According to the prosecution, the conspiracy was involved in a replacement request from the authorities who were reviewing the company in Lindberg.
The Republican Cossy reported an attempted bribe indictment to federal agents and helped with the case.
There's no doubt about Cozzy.
The prosecution says that Lindbergh's partners told Hayes to send $250,000 to the second election campaign in Kodg.
According to the prosecution, Hayes was the first person to argue that he would be careful if he were to run that expensive money, but he eventually broke it.
In the prosecution, Hayes says, "I'll do whatever you want."
All right, I'll do it.
The Federal Attorney General asked her e-mail information about legal transactions, but no response.
Facebook, we want to improve our sense of well-being.
The first attempt to raise the sense of well-being is that some users will soon be able to see the number of people watching the video.
With this change that follows the same test of Instagram in Australia in July, people can only be found privately for posters!
This new Facebook effort will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Mia Garrick, the policy manager of Facebook Australia, said that the change was based on a feedback from a mental health professional who considers the number of people to be the cause of a social comparison.
Garrick says there was a very positive feedback from many of the group's group of bullying and mental health groups."
Just remove the numbers so that users can value exchanges and the quality of content instead of the number of goods and reactions.
He said that it would be more comfortable to share with the platform than it would be possible for users to feel competitors.
Garrick also claimed that the same metrick and Insurance that he was using on Facebook was available.
It is not long before a country like Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, Ireland, or other test tests run the same test.
Under Facebook's Instagram does not tell us when the test will end, or when it will be changed.
“There were the first positive feedback on the experience in Instagram, but now we hear feedback and learn from it,” Garrick said.
Garrigli in Australia, the world's discipline, pointed out that there are Facebook and Instagram users in Australia who are extremely active.
He thinks Australia is a great country with good feedback as to whether this is a great experience for people or not.

The broken bag repairs to the octopus.
One day my mother's favorite bag of gold disappeared.
When your favorite bag is broken, it's human nature to keep repairing and using it.
I helped him do that, but he was a handiwork parcel.
Maybe I'm not selling anymore when I'm giving up.
My mother's bag, he's the ultimate pouch.
So I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to make a lot of money.
My mother was afraid to throw away... but I didn't want to give up.
So we're going to go to the home center and we're going to look for something to replace with this combination.
It's all silver color, but it's all ringed gold.
And I'm going to give you a little bit more examples of what I'm going to do.
I've been to Cando in a bad way, and I've finally found it!
I was impressed when I found myself at the hand corner.
So let's see if we can do that.
So let's say I'm going to use a little bit of the same thing.
I'm going to buy two of them, one at both ends of the bag handle.
If the ring is small, but it has the same size as the one left on the left-hand side of the bag...
So we're done.
So let's see if we can do that.
Dookki!
It's a little bit hard to figure out how to draw a line.
So let's say I'm going to draw a little bit of a line here.
But the ring is small, so it's too hard to move.
Let's do a couple more of these.
So let's say I have more gold than I'm going to do.
I'm not going to be able to do that in a minute, but I'm going to add a little bit more silicon parts and I think I'm going to get a more designive level up.
I'm going to tell you that the National Railway Responsibly is on the train, Hiroshima Bear, 0 hours' trip to Japan, Attez.
Flight train is 28 days after the JR Island Station imaged "resurrection of the U.S. iron age" in wait for its departure at the JR.
Those who enjoy the journey of the weather train, which was imaged as "The Emergency Movement of the National Railway", = 28 days.
On 28 days, the weather train was taken between the island island island of Kuma-Kan in the image of "The Emergency Movement of the National Railway".
Railway fans, about 240 people, boarded two blue cars from Hiroshima station that same morning and set off on a journey of about 0 hours to the Bear Station.
It's a night matrix car that's been combined with bears books and Tokyo for 950 to 80 years.
Japan's tourism took place in two days, as part of a tourism campaign by JR and so on.
The train is a seven-fold train with a passenger car, a mountain line, a haystack, a deer line.

The Pakistani SNSster, Ms. Candir Valoci, was sentenced to lifelong murder.
Candir Valoci was named after photos posted on social media in July 2016.
A popular Pakistani social media member, Ms. Candir Valoci, was convicted on Friday, his sister's murder, and was sentenced to lifeless imprisonment by the highest attention of Pakistan's father-in-law.
At some point, it's not that great in Western standards, but the famous Balochist woman who has been promiscuous in Pakistan for a very high regard for women was strangled in July 2016.
My brother, Hammad Weissim, has been arrested.
He said he didn't regret what he did.
His attorney, Saldahl Meemdo, told AFP that the court of Multan in eastern cities was sentenced to life imprisonment by the wait-winning trial of the Wessyam defendant.
He said, "I'm going to be innocent in the Supreme Court."
Before this, Mr. Valoch's mother, Anwar May, told AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
My son's not guilty.
My daughter and my son."
Mr. Baloch's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of disregarding the laws of fatherly society, there has been a reversal of voices calling for women to act on the so-called "honor killing".
In the case of the woman who chose to marry herself, in the case of Avaroch, she was burned, shot, strangled, or strangled by a crime that dishonored her family in honor of her sexuality.
Killing is performed by a very close relative.
After that, the Pakistani Kissars and Dieya Act (retribution), the victims can be forgiven by the relatives of the victims.
Three months after Mr. Baloch's murder, the council passed a new bill requiring life on honor killings.
But whether a murder is committed to an honorable crime is entrusted to a judge's judgment, and the murderer may also claim another logical motive and be pardoned.
In Baroch's case, their first parents insisted that their son be pardoned.
But I was sad that I lost my son, and my parents changed my mind and told me to forgive him.
In an international hatred of the killing, Pakistan has taken unprecedented steps to declare its parents and its successors. But the case continued.
Baloch's famous actions have encouraged Pakistani Cricket teams to post a strip show and also to wear a red dress that was widely open on Valentine Day.
Many have been recognized as young people who have opened up new heavens and earth in a country that is considered to be bold and political to improve the status of women, such as Kim Kadasian.
The "honored murder" rubles are ethnic norms that remain widely-responsive throughout South Asia and are particularly affected by the actions of women, but men can be victims.

The next evacuation site in Okinawa, Japan, was set up at the "Grounds of the Old Harbor" in the cold sheet box.
The Yamada newspaper sends a 4-in-the-art relief shelter and 1600 acres (about a million yen) of clean-up storage box to the four-in-the-art government council in Yamada, Japan, which was hit by a earthquake on the outskirts of Okinawa.
We'll be positioned on various coastlines for tsunamis, such as "one evacuation location".
On the next two days, I'm going to give you the gift of the First Refuge in the Zanke area of the Old Harbor Ground.
The earthquake in Saooka, which has been responsible for a joint agreement, provides a cold sheet to the government's government in the hottest region near the earthquake.
The contribution is made by the Senate Corporation (400) Shibuya River (500, 2).
Many of the residents of the offshore coast of Japan fled after the tsunami.
He fled to the first evacuation site on the highest ground in the city of Koaoka.
The massive tsunami did not occur, and most of the refugees returned to their lodging facilities and facilities, but many of the shelters were heard in the air because of the cold.
One of the challenges was dealing with cold weather and windstorms in preparation for similar disasters.
It's a sheet that can cover itself with coldness and rain.
They also have a block of heat in the flames.
The sheet is about 1.3 meters long, and when it folds, it becomes a nine-inch pocket size.
Four layers of structure use gold and silver tables and cover the body with cold weather and blocking heat functioning under the sun.
The first evacuation point is set up a metal box to cover the sheet.

(left from left) AASA’s Athletes Sports Academy.
The Napocalypse National Institute of Arts and Arts and Sports with the Napocalypse Clinic Sports Club ELOVEE, the 25th, has signed an independent sporting partnership.
In addition to being actively involved in the activities carried out by both groups, which are training various competitions, we can arrange for inter-supported support systems, such as physical control and prevention of children from fleeing to the island.
Both groups share their primary trainers and instructors with them in sports, and so forth.
As a team of offshore team travels outside the island, they are also involved in dissolutions, such as the burden of the travellers.
In particular, collaboration with the Community Corporation Assemblies of Kagoshima's Sport Center, which joins the AASA for such assemblies, supports athletes to slow down on their journeys and the fatigue of gatherings.
We also associate with local osteoporosis and hospital relationships in the event of the convention in Okinawa and Okinawa, Yashima, with the athletes from outside the island.
On 25 days, the town of Elavko, known to be known, was established.
Then, both groups organized a Taipei course by the Aslech trainer.
The local sports clubs and school leaders, their guardians, learned to use the right use of Teping and prevent them.
Director Tatsuya said that his campaign to stop running off the island in the sports environment has been shared with each other, and that many of the things he can do with him are possible to spread the connection between other islands of Togae and other islands.
Premier Nagashi (43) told us that it was very hard to have a partner with a real organization like AASA if we had to absorb a good place to care for the sports environment of children from the remote island.
Kawako-san is now broken by common sense.
It's like a guy who can update his identity.
As a brain scientist, Mr. Saeko-san has thought twice about Mote.
The amazing brain-scientific motto theory that has used so much knowledge and new knowledge in its own hands.
And then I'll send you a sequel.
In the previous article, the non-obvious octopus sticked to a traditional "Fantajii" and snuffed out the pattern for Mote!
In the semester, I've talked about how to get away from such a bad guy and become a cool, motivating man.
You'll live when you're caught.
In the previous slide, we talked about how coolness is always evolved, and we need to look at all kinds of works and how people behave, and learn patterns from day to day.
If you're learning a pattern, you might want to do this in a way that your brain systemizes your behavior so you can live.
I don't know if I'm going to be motivating, but I still think I'm evolutionary every day.
So it's Rak to live.
I've been teaching in Hitoshishima and Tokyo, so I've talked with young people, and I've learned a lot about how to deal with them.
But if you were caught up with a college professor there, and you'd be a bit difficult to follow the old pattern that says, "Agraduate teacher is more dignified."
I don't like that, so I enjoy it every day.
I can't live if I say, "This is what I should be."
Because if you don't change, you change your society.
I've been talking about this very thing in a recent interview, "What a terrible world I live in."
It's something that you recognize and come out naturally.
He needs to be light.
It hurts when you ask me around.
I'm sure you've been hanging out at Cannes Film Festival.
I'm not going to do that. I'm going to do that in a different color.
And that's what we're going to do.
I mean, it's not that easy if you're caught up with the "kind" thing.
As far as I've heard, it seems to me that "no man's position, no age, no man's being cute" can be acquitted, saved.
It's hard to say what's cute.
I don't know if it's cute. (Laughter)
The illegal state of Nigeria, north of the state of Nigeria, doubles the number of refugees to 40,000: UNHCR.
The United Nations's announcement on Friday shows that during the past four months, the number of refugees from the western part of Nigeria has doubled by about 40,000.
According to the United Nations Refugee Organization, the confusion has created a new humanitarian crisis that each organization will need to work together to finance a new 5.5 million dollars by the end of this year.
The UNHCR official Bavaral Barlok said that the Islamic extremist organization Bokoharum, which has been protesting in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent armed attacks.
Rather, during the past ten months, violent acts of violence in the states of Sokoto, Zamphara, and Katina have been organized by armed groups.
"The fear of illegal and unstable conditions is common," said the press official on Friday.
Kidnapping, tortures, assaults, murders and sexual violence are frequent, and attackers are also working to destroy their homes.
The military and the police are also being sent to stand up to criminal organizations in the region.
But the army is tired of fighting with the Islamic West African branch, which was divided from the Cocoharam and the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come by the name of the group," Baroque says.
And that's what they're going to do.
Most of the refugees are on their way to the neighboring country of Niger.
UNHCR is a statement, particularly in Sokoto, and has announced that refugees across Niger will rise in the next few months.

In recent years an ad-owner has started to purchase LFPs directly, which, in order to respond to the demand that "a person's relationship to a particular product or brand image to a specific ad" from the end of December, are going to be able to buy an admixture that is associated with the media.
This time, the introduction of LFP is expanded by the response to the headers.
As a result of the RFP's header-built response, it is possible to directly participate in ad-bulling purchases, and to increase access to advertising opportunities.
Also, the limited medium companies have secured ad borders for distribution to individual traders and brand images and prevents brand-value damage.
The solution that LFP uses to organize and organise its own codes, called "Wrapper Soul", is a combination that can be applied to the introduction of the mediums.

The White House's Resolved EU requests a compromise with the EU and demands Mr. Boris Johnson.
Now that it has been only three weeks since the final EU's conference, the Prime Minister has been concerned that it would be time for the Prime Minister to launch a large concession.
Mr. Boris Johnson is faced with the rebellion of the cabinet in order to lower his demands for EU and compromise with the EU.
The negotiation over the new customs system in exchange for the Response of Ireland's border has been closed, and EU sees the alternatives of Jonson as "unable".
The senior ministers hope that the EU banners of Germany's Prime Minister Angela Melkel will propose that the three-year period of time remitation be offered to the conservative leader of the Republic of Germany.
The Sun newspaper spoke to three ministers who were determined to confront the Prime Minister after the day of the conservative party held in Manchester next week.
They are demanding that the Prime Minister leave the "EU" strategy to threaten an unsolved evacuation of the high-professional adviser Dominic Kamings, and they are going to accept the offer that the EU will offer at a minimum time.
One cabinet said that it was the only way to get us out of the state's 3th day in the current state.
In the House, we will never win in numbers, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister has to use what is available to him rather than walking.
It doesn't work even if it's extreme, and Kaming's plans are clearly failed.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised that if it didn't work, she would tell Mr. Johnson to run an agreement with former Prime Minister Terry May.
He's the superior minister, and he's going to tell Boris to bring her back to the House of Representatives if she needs to.
And that's what we're trying to do.
And if there is no delay, then Boris is over, and We are all done.
Sir John Mayer blamed Boris for not seriously considering the negotiation.
The former party leader of the conservative party says we would like to make an agreement with the EU.
But We have not seen the Prime Minister come to speak with the EU, and We have not made a treaty.
Instead, we saw that the prime minister was fighting a bullfight in Scotland, trying to test eggs in Weuers, and talking with the public on the street, and that the election war was becoming so serious.
"If the Prime Minister's press secretary acknowledges that the agreement is still a long way ahead yesterday," "if no one remembers the goal, it's a long way to reach it."
But the press also said that the Ben bill to force a retraction of the three-month period was greatly weak in our negotiation in Brussels.
The press said that the bill was definitely blocking our negotiations, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are trying to keep forward with their lives despite the bill's legislature.

We were told that the Glasgow accent would never succeed in the world.
Lorraine Kelly made it clear that his glossy accent would never make him a politician.
Before it appeared on the television screen, a 59-year-old Kelly turned back 35 years in the broadcast industry, saying:
She says, "I'm still 25. I'm very nervous."
I was working as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your glossy accent doesn't work in the TV industry.
I went to London to see all the team of TV-ams before taking over at Glasgow office and the show was broadcast.
I will never forget that Ann Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing the legendary actress David.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as the living legend.
It turns out this is where I want to be.

"Help and enthusiasm," and "quieting" were the key to survival in the TV industry, and the officers said, "I must put it into work."
To be honest and faithful.
To do what you have to do, to be interested in all kinds of people, and to be interested.
Looking back on the news that shock was in her mind, Kelly said that the cover of the Dumblene shooting incident was "a very painful thing."
The day after the horrific incident of six students and teachers being murdered, I didn't think many of our children were killed or injured.
Pams was killed by his five-year-old daughter, Joanna, who personally wanted to meet me, so we were able to speak for hours in her home.
I've been going to Joanna's funeral and I've been friends ever since.
Kelly added that in 2007 when Kate and Gary McKan's daughter, Madelan, were missing, they said, "It was very hard," and they really respect their strength and courage."
They have to endure the bitter and groaning of the Internet that they don't know what's going on in their beloved daughter.
I'm really sorry about the couple.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine is broadcast at 8:30 a.m. to ITV on September 30th.
Ginbabuye, Chiwenga, afraid of a trap.
According to the government's officials, the vice president of Constantino Chiwenga refused to be afraid that Robert Mugabe's offer of office from former President Robert Mugbe might be a trap to confirm the military action in November 2017.
As the negotiations between Mugbe and the state defense forces continue, Mugbe offered Chihuenga the presidential position, reports The Zimbabwe Independence Last week.
But it is not inconceivable that Chiwenga refused, but because of Mugab’s intention to use Chinanga to tell the world's leaders and Africans that he had been deported by the coupling forces, government officials report on social media.
Mgabe, who has been in power for 37 years, identified by the authorities as the head of the President’s cabinet, has been told that there was an uproar on the case at that time.
The authorities say that Mugabe has made contact with users in Chienga when he discovered that he is losing power.
According to the government's officials, the intervening between the legislature and the former President was made by three.
President George Chalanva, then president of the Central Intelligence Agency, Aaron Nepela, and the Roman Catholic clergyman Phydris Muconnori engaged in negotiations, and the high officials reported.
Gydesion Gono, one of the directors of the Dinbai Reservation Bank, was commissioned by Mugbe to deliver the president's seat alone to the General ZDF.
Mgabe, a symbol of Africa after death rather than alive, tried to denounce the military action of the African Federation, asking its leaders to intervene in Africa.
The offer to yield the presidential position to former CDF was not based on the choice of former President Mugbe.
"I started to tire part of the late President's family and was a throwaway attempt to save the situation as quickly as possible."
But there was also some political aims for the late President to change the flow at least in diplomatic fashion.
If you're going to destroy the constitutional order, remember that the Commanders were not going to break the constitutional order, and they're not going to break it.
The president expected that Chiwenga, then the head of the military, would be trapped and to raise the claim that the constitutional order did not break.
He wanted the African Union to be identified as a coup without fully grasping the entire situation and eventually to call it the Couperator, and to consider military intervention a validity.
And that's what it meant and calculated at the bottom of the offer.
The authorities say that when Mgabe found out that the defenses couldn't protect him, he was moved,
Warned that the army would be executed like Kadafi, he said that Mgabe had to write a deportation sentence.
The military commanders told Mgabe that even if they broke into the office of the president, called the Blue Reef, they would not turn their guns on their people.
At that point Mogab said that he wanted to protect his family and to prove to him two of the army's thievery.
And the commanders of those days and their commanders were fully aware of their intentions.
In the words of the president's final message, the officials said that the powerful metaphor was used to describe "Ii Tiri Bemawapa Machuhupa" (We belong to a group of Kamokhraj, or army), and I would not be in the midst of political competition if I were not a politicians, and I would not be in the midst of a political competition."
The military told the other military commanders of the region that their aim was not to defeat Mgabe but to eliminate the "criminals" surrounding him.
And Mugab tried to call back in the same way that he had been exiled in South Africa for a short time in order to discuss the coupter and his successors.
In addition to negotiating with the army, Mugab needed assistance from the region.
Not only is the power of economic power and territory available but the then president of the South Africa Development Cooperation, South Africa, has made it clear that South Africans, who refused to intervene in this process, would have been sent to Harare as soon as the army entered the president's home.
"Just because it was not supported by President Putin and the leaders of Africa, it could not have been achieved," the source says in the newspaper Independence.
The United Nations's second strike has appealed to the nuclear ban on allegations and ratified the treaty in 32 countries.
At the UN headquarters of New York, 26 days ago, a meeting for the world without nuclear weapons was opened, and the daughter of the chief of the president of the Red Cross at the atomic bomb.
On the new day, five countries ratified the nuclear banion treaty, becoming a total of 32 countries.
The effect of the treaty requires 50 countries ratified.
The meeting and criticism took place on the 26th day of the United Nations' 'International Day for the total devastation of nuclear weapons'.

China needs a powerful leadership, if it doesn't.
China needs a strong and unified leadership, and soon the country will collapse, and the Chinese government has said in a policy document published on Friday that the Chinese people's Republic of China will begin the 70th anniversary of the 70th anniversary of the collapse of the People's Republic of China.
The Chinese government's news agency said that since the Communist Party took power 70 years ago, the success of the party has been based on the leadership of the party.
China is vast and complex, but the issue of governance is little.
It says, "The Chinese will face divisions and fall, except for a united force of leadership, and will be a terrible thing in the world."
China's authorities have long been justified in dealing with problems in a harsh way, as if it were a national stability" in Beijing in '98.
Tuesday’s second largest economic national monument, a powerful state official, has been advocating people who have been in control since 2012, and who are still in opposition to the party.
He's also overseeing a military reconnaissance program that threatens the region.
The policy document says that China is not going to export its own development model and that it is not going to take its own models and that it is simply seeking peace rather than conquest.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or world domination of other people.
In modern times, China has been held in a row and left a deep mark of war and confusion with its suffering; it will never be able to overcome the pain that it has experienced to others.
China has also faced difficult problems, such as the loss of the country's inability to move in a harsh trade war with the United States, and the low weather and the opposition movement in China's Hong Kong.
China never abandons nuclear interests and does not allow security and sovereignty to be lost, says the White House.
"The customs that continue to raise the threat of trade war have nothing to do with the solution."
China is a fully formed industrial system, a full industrial chain, a larger market space and a powerful economic development.
"The trade war never weakens.
I am convinced that China has the power to face difficult times, transform the crisis into a chance and create a new world.
China has no idea of what to do with the United States, and so the United States should calm down its development.
The United States has no control over China, and it is even more likely that it will stop China’s development.
If we were to suppress, suppress other countries, and move our national contradictions abroad, the United States would not be able to maintain its strength.

The MlC of Spencer, the eating disorder, bans dieting topics within the family.

In a case against whether the marriage is contrived with the same sex, the Ministry of Miyagi decided to accept this.
While there are more than 20 countries in the country who accept homosexuality, and there is no legal effectiveness in the country, there is a growing system in which the government, such as the Tao City, is advocating equal partnership.
The verdict confirmed the reality of two women's marriage.
It was considered the first judicial decision that homosexuals recognized legal protection.
It has been under five courts to demand damage to the country as an unconstitutional suit for not accepting the same marriage because of the law of civil law and the law.
I want to gain understanding of the sentence, to ensure the rights of the sex minority, and to gain more debate about the way a system is designed to approve of a large number of families.
Women have been living with us for about seven years, and they have also received marriage certificates in the United States, but they have broken up because of their infidelity, and their ex-military partners demand damage.
The decision confirmed "the reality of marriage between a man and a woman."
It's a landmark decision to extend to the same sex acquiescence of a true marriage with the right to marry, such as social insurance.
Even more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution that made "liberation freedom of marriage" based only on mutual agreement.
"There are two sides," he said, "so I don't know what the same sex is, so I don't know what it means to deny the same marriage."
"Constitution is not supposed to be an equal marriage," and it is expected that governments who don’t tell us whether or not to be prohibited will be swindled by the same marriage suits throughout the country.
On the other hand, the challenge was to reduce the price of legal protection as a result of not being allowed to marry men and women."
Is it not reasonable to distinguish between the right to guard, while the same is true with men and women?
The awareness of married women is also changing, such as 7 percent of those who have tried to admit marriage by law in a nationwide census on the subject.
As the diversity of living styles continues, the law is tied to traditional family statues to take away the rights of those who don't.
In fact, marriage is not a "compliant" approved by the law, so it is not restricted to the lack of kindness on tax terms and to the lack of mutual custody.
We need to revisit family law from various points of view, such as not staying in marriage between homosexuals and expanding the legal rights of the marriage.

It's a serious pollution, video clearly.
In Sidney's 109 million-dollar tourism resources that bring Australia's economy every year, Sidney is the largest migrant in the world with opera house, surfer keys, Luna Park, and one of the famous Harbour Bridges.
But there is an ugly truth under the bridge.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst channels of water where about 15 teas of Olympic water flows every year.
This terrible statistic makes one of our biggest eyebrows is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video from above Sydney Harbor, the waterway around the most popular city in Australia is mining shells, plastic bags, bottles, and missing shoes and clothes, and even the remains of animals, all in Sidney Harbour.
The biggest factor that can jam the waterway inside is plastic.
Katherine Dafoen, vice president of the Sydney Harbor Research Program, by accident, was published on September 27 in the world view, says that this is a paradox.
The view is truly beautiful, but one of the most altered and contaminated mouths of our country's shorelines.
According to CSIRO, a plastic of 1560 kilograms of plastic is expected to flow into the water at once, and most of it goes into Sydney Harbour by rainwater drains.
Dr. Dawanne said that he had rained a couple of severe heavy rains, but then Sidney Harbor was... pretty tragic."
Two thirds of the pollution flows out of the water flowing through the streets.
But a small part of the iceberg, under the water of the Sydney Harbor, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is hidden in the oceans.
"I don't know what the truth is if I don't actually go down to the sea," said Richard Nicholas, the owner of the Diving Center Manley, recovering some 500 kilograms of plastic every year on his own team.
So let's see if we can figure out what's on the bottom of the water.
It's overwhelming, but... more than half of what we find is plastic bags.
So let's see if we can figure out where this is going to be.
The Sydney Harbor is beautiful, and no one can believe all these plastics and bottles flow under the water right away.
Jeremy Brown, one of the producers and directors of Orhan Protocol, said that they can reduce any plastic and baskets that are in the water, and that local residents can also be seen.
He says, "We should start with the origin."
So we have to focus more on what's going on in the ocean, because we're going to reduce the amount of plastic we use, and we're going to recycle it better, and eventually it's going to flow into the ocean.
Because 50 percent of our oxygen we suck comes from the oceans, hurting the ocean is going to kill us.
The oceans absorb about 30 percent of carbon dioxide, and the oceans are food sources.
But we're going to restore the Sydney Harbor and restore it back to the old scene, and it's very simple.
Killing the sea means killing people.
This month, new studies with plastic and mental health have been published in the same way that the recycling company's TMRA funded the project as part of a project in which the environmental protection and the reduction of natural containers can be seen.
According to a new survey, 82 percent of children between 12 and 18 years of age feel hopeless about plastic baskets, 25 percent think that the problem of disposable plastics is adult.
In the study, the parents also said that 93 percent of the parents surveyed and found that they were more concerned about the amount of plastic available to the oceans.
Most of the researchers said they wanted to do something about plastic baskets, but they didn't know what to do with changing it, and it led to ecology.

Ten years later, the World Larry Championship (WRC) was decided in Japan in November 2020!
Yahoo!
The World Larry Championship is scheduled in Japan in November 2020.
The International Automobile Union (FIA) announced September 27, 2010, in the province of Tsuji Prefecture, Japan, on November 22, 2010.
I'll look back on the last WRC round-up championship!
(18)}Heart.
The event in Japan was not the last time that was held on the North Sea Road in 2010.
What is WRC going to be resurrected in 2020?
The WRC World Larry Championship is one of four world championships ruled by the FEC (FEC) and the International Automobile Union (FIA).
Since 1973, I have been privileged to be the highest of the world's history and tradition, not only to the public roads (pave roads) closed, but to run fast through different roads, such as mud roads and snow roads.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRCmanufachachacher title since 1999, and it became a big topic.
This time we launched a committee to call Japan round to open a gruesome Japan.
As a result, the World Motor Sports Council, the Supreme Assembly of the United Nations (FIA) was decided to hold the WRC Japanese round 2020.
Two governors in Japan, Toyota GAZO Racing Rat, and Tyota President of the WRT, Tjuta Card General, said:
• Daimono Nakama-san.
I'm really excited about the 2020 Japanese championship of China's World Larry Championship (WRC) in collaborating with people to make it a big challenge for the world as its representative motor sports center.

I'm so happy that in 2020, when Tokyo's Olympic Paralymphic Games are held, the Japanese rounds of international ballots are held here in the ‘Prince’ state.
●TOYOTA GAZO Racing WRT representative of the Führer Tjoata Card General.
"I'm very happy to have JarisWRC run in Japan.
And I said, "Well, I'm not going to let you go."
Many people have also commented on the opening of Japan's rounds.
The Japanese round of the WRC world Larry championship will be held between November 19, 2020 and 22 days.

I don't know if the Tasmanian deville is the key to cancer.
Tasmanian deville may have the key to cancer, but researchers have opened a breakthrough that could lead to a major change in the patient's treatment.
Medical researchers have found out how some of the cancer cells are camouflaged.
Researchers have found the same process for Tasmanian Deville and humans.
It is hoped that there will be a new way to treat cancer patients.
What's the common sense between Tasmanian Deville and humans?
It's a cancer cell that can't be seen.
A team of researchers at the Peter Mammal Cancer Center in Melbourne have discovered a large possibility that if cancer doesn't respond to immune treatment, it can greatly change the treatment for cancer.
There may be a key to working with a deadly face tumor that threatens the future of Tasmanian Deville which is close to extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and baggage, using a series of proteins called PRC2, are no longer reacting to a marker, and the immune system is no longer attacking cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating skin cancer, which is called tiny cell lung cancer, neurological cell tumors, and mercel cells.
"The most important thing in this project is that we can revert the process for patients who can show resistance to immunization."
It may be that the immune system will be able to identify cancer cells by reuse the traditional treatment, the marker, the protein known as MHC.
Professor Dawson said it could have a substantial impact on lung cancer patients.
"Premom cancer is a pancreatic disease that pervades the world.
And we could treat it in a much better way.
Researchers hope that the discovery will eventually be used to treat facial tumors in Tasmania deville, where cancer cells can detect as well.
"It's amazing that there will be a completely identical process of human beings and Tasmanian Deville".
"It was very difficult to treat the tumor in Tasmanian deville.
But if the drug that works for humans can be used in Tasmanian Debil, it may be helpful to control tumors."
And that's what it's all about.
Scientists are surprised to discover and marvel at the current solar system that is understanding of the formation of planetary planets, a giant Jupiter planet orbiting around a small star called red dwarf, 30 light years from the earth.
On September 26, 2019, the artist image of the giant gas planet GJ3512b was published around the Red Cross, which is the main star.
The stars are usually much larger than the largest stars around them.
But in this case, the size of stars and planets is very different, and the researchers said on Thursday:
The stars that are called GJ3512 are about 12% larger than the sun, but the planet around them has at least half the mass of Jupiter, our largest planet of our solar system.
"It's amazing, indeed, that this research published in Science, led by the Institute of Catalan space Research in Spain, says Juan Carlos Morares, a cosmonautist at the Institute of Space,
Theoretically formed model is usually showing that low mass stars are the primary stars of a smaller planet like Earth or a small planet.
In this case, we found a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter, around a very small star.
The planet, mainly gas, was found using a telescope in Spanish color Alto observatory.
It's a planet around the stars and around the elliptical orbit of the stars.
The red star is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
GJ3512 not only is much smaller than our sun, but is about the size of a giant planet, about 35% larger than Jupiter.
It's darker than the sun because of its small evaporation, and the surface temperature is about 3,800 degrees.
It's a little bit red, so it's a little bit red.
While there are signs that the second planet is currently orbiting the stars, the third planet could have been released from the past and could explain the elliptical orbit of the Jupiterian planet.
A planet is produced from the same disk that is made of gas and dust that generates the stars that orbit themselves.
The most powerful planet formation model, called Core Collection Model, is that the object is caused by a solid particle in the disk and the gravitational force produced by the eggs of that planet causes the atmosphere around it to become agitated.
So, we're going to use a model called the self-gravity unstable model to explain this strange planetary system.
"In this case, the primitive planetary circle around the newly born stars may have been slightly larger and less warmer than we thought."
So this is a situation where the disks become unstable and some dense areas may also appear.
It's a little bit like this, but it's a lot more complicated than that.
I'm going to have to take a look at my colleagues.
Marshal Marion County's office, Cassandra Medina Hernandez, 38, has been accused of having his colleagues eat a bean dip with a stimulant.
On Thursday, Albani's Cassandra Mani Medina Hernández (38) was accused of taking in other people the methane-femin and regulated drugs for the B-degree.
The charges were triggered by a case at the Sri Lanka Weiwe food store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to estimates made from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Delhi for lunch, and he asked Sheriff Marion to make some fun of Medina Hernandez because he saw Medina's making beans.
According to the pledge, the victim told his agent that he had never given methane fetamine before.' "I thought it tasted strange after eating a few words, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When she came back to work, her stomach got sick.
Albany Demrat Herard, a local hospital where women went, was determined that metin' methane fetamine could have been mixed with beans.
According to The Smoothing Gun, another employee said that Medina Hernández put a drug on the victim's food, while the third employee said that the suspect had sent a message to him that he had misinformed methane bottles.
According to an article in the Iron Live, the surveillance footage received from Delilah reported that Medina Hernandez turned against the camera and pulled something from the Brothers behind an electronic oven.
Then they rise up and wipe their noses and walk to the table and put their beans on a small piece of paper.
The police said it was on top of a plate that they had taken from Brahmser.
According to Oregon Steutsman Journal, the sheriff said that he did not think there was a guest in the food supply at this time.
Medina Hernandez is held in Marion County prison instead of bailing $52 million.
According to Medina Hernández's long-term arrest account, there has been a record of the crimes committed by violent, robberies, assaults, robberies, robberies, robberies, robberies, methanfemins, and possession of controls.

I'm looking at the One On-A Challenge Hall.
At the beginning of the new season (1919-20) Matsumoto began its 73th anniversary in the afternoon and went out of the hall as "72 in 2 Badi and 2 Bogie".
The end point's temporary cut-line (to 65th Thailand) has been under 2 subs of commute and has finished round outside the front of the predestination.
Matsumoto sent Burdy first at half-5 (p5), but three Pattbogies on 8.
I made a lot of opportunities through the rounds, but I was plagued by scenes where my pals were so dwindling.
In the morning, the simulater from 28th grade collapsed with "77" and Hall out as a three-over-distribution.

President J.R. Attez, in early designation.
In a press conference on 27th of the Easteast Sea, President Kimi Hiroshi Tsuki made a change in his attitude toward early designs, saying that he should not organize the problem of collaborating with Shibuya in the United States.
In particular, I'm going to talk to him about the meeting place and the front.
And he stressed that since he organized all of his problems, he couldn't keep up with a lot of things.
On the other hand, he said, "This is my idea.
The province is concerned about not being able to get enough water back to the Ayi River during the tunnel.
In the case of changing the method for this response, I'm going to do some real things, but I think it's hard to think about from the safety of the project."
He denied that the changes he referred to were "never possible."
The effect of the opening time, he said, is that he can't say that he can't afford the South Alps Tunnel, the River Station, and the Nagoya Station three areas, but he's most concerned about the Shikata Prefecture.

The secret of Royal family:
Royal family has to travel around the world hundreds of times throughout their lives as part of their public service.
Most of the time, it is easy to use the royal family as a private plane to move the royal family around for an important event or show.
Of course, there's got a private plane.
There's no need to be parallel to a long column in the country, no limit on the number of luggage packages, there's likely to be a host of guests, including unexpected passengers.
According to the documentary of the channel 5 which appeared recently, the queen and the prince of Phillip are not the only regular visitors in the royal plane.
During the Royal Flight secret show, the queen's ex-husband, with Family, has shown a number of furry guests in flight.
Bob Sears said sometimes, like most of the royal guests, there are also very important Royal Dogs."
The queen's cog dog is famous, and it is not surprising to ask that we take her to travel with us to a favorite pet.
Queen Elizabeth likes dogs since she was a child, says she has had more than 30 cogs since she was a queen.
In 2007, it was claimed that they had five dogs, Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow, Holly.
These five cocker spailers, Occup, Flash, Spikes, five spams, and four of the siders, berries, berries,and candy dogs.
I'm sure the staff on the Royal Air Force will be busy.
The king's staff have been seen asking the lawns to leave their dogs before boarding, and add their services, and the seashores continue.
I'm glad you've never been an accident.
The show also found that the package during the queen's public trips was shocking.
According to the programnaator, the queen had 12 tons of equipment in the British federal tour of 44000 miles in 553."
That's the equivalent of two giant elephants.
But the queen is not the only one who likes fashion.
Lady Kenbridge also has her own preferences when carrying his clothes, and so on, she takes a seat at every dress.

During the first wave of the Republican opposition campaign in Deepsaus, Jacques Edwards, elected Afghan state of Alabama, retired for 0 years.
Edward, at the end of his struggle with pancreatic cancer, told his relatives that he died at his home in the feahop.
While the Republican Party is on the rise in Deepsaus, many of the Republican Republicans in Alabama have been elected to the federal government, Edwars is one of the first of these waves, and in 965 he was elected to Congress late in the United States.
Mr. Edwards has served a member of the Federation for '0.
According to reports published by the bereaved, Edwars recently asked what world he wanted to live in, and said he wanted to return to his thanks.
According to the family, "I want my grandkids to grow up in a country where I've recovered from daily conversations and efforts to solve my country's problems."

Yamamoto then tweeted that it was a mistake of a certain chicken.
Kawata-kun-san says, "I'm going to look at the tweet for the post in the 27-morrow conference.
At the end of the 27-day morning, after explaining the account to the provinces, Yamamoto said that if you would rather be uncomfortable with the post on my post, it's not my intention."
I emphasized what I removed in my own decision, and I avoided tweeting if it was inappropriate.

With Michelle Obama and Instagram, Megan Markl is hailed as "inspiration."
On Thursday, Michel Obama praised Megan Markal with a friendly instagram and called Lady Sachsenhausen a model and called her a more thoughtful leader.
During ten days of South Africa's official visit with his son Archie Harrison Mount Bachten-Winner, she had already attended a youth's reception this week and visited the headquarters of the Obama Foundation.
The former President of the United States said, "The old lady has broken old habits and made the world a better world, the thoughtful leader of my friend, Lord Sussex.
Mrs Obama has posted a photo of a Megan who shares with the foundation leader, and has inspired many of the girls from all over the world to talk to the Obama Foundation for proper education.
Lady Megan, former actress of the suit, served as a guest editor in the September of the British edition of Vogue and interviewed Mrs. Obama.
In her direct conversation, former President looked back at how motherhood and motherhood changed her life.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "It's like being a mother is in the higher class of abandonment."
I learned most of my work as a mother that my children always find themselves who they want to be and that to grow up with a reasonable distance.
Not the ideals of parents and the desires of their own children, but essentially to find out who they are.
Mrs. Obama, who actually knows the spotlight preservings around the world, advised her a little bit in an interview of Good Housekeeping magazine.
"Sometimes, I feel too much pressure from myself and those around me."

I've got a lot of complaints about the cards and the owner's fitness, and I've got a license to sell.
Washington - The Al-Cervatory Commissioner of the state of Washington filed a complaint that since questioning the fitness of the owner, Washington should revisit the drinking licenses of the local T-lantern International Hotel.
The committee lacked the right to sue for three members of Congress, two former judges, two former Jewish leaders, and most of the expulsors, who do not live in Washington, D.C., or in the state of Washington.
According to Washington Post, the complaint to revoke the alcohol offering of the hotel, based on the state law that requires the "opportunity" of the applicants to obtain a booze license.
The first complaint filed last summer was that he filed a retaliation for a retaliation of President Thomas's assault and said he was in violation of state law.
The complaint was dismissed because the permit has already been granted.
This second complaint was made to update the license.
The bees that Bentley raises are the first ones to harvest the beebeests!
I'm going to show you a little bit about the taste of the bees that the frying bees feed on the Flying B knee.
In May 2019, in the Creek plantations of Bentley, England, the first beekeeper was harvested in September.
The bees who work in the circumstantial factory have collected more than a hundred bottles of honey from a single nest.
How does Bentley manage to raise beekeepers in a factory that builds a car?
I want to taste this!
Let's see, there's a couple of ways to do this.
Peter Bosh, director of Bentley's manufacturing department, commented:
"In the early part of this year, I wanted to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
Beekeepers have been watching the nectar collecting nectars of various flowers from wild flowers planted in the grounds and from the mountains around them.
And I found that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it's amazing to have this amount of harvest in the first year.
Bentley is one of the most active beekeepers on the top of the Susstinian high car manufacturers, and Bentley is one of the most successful crew factories and businesses.
We're not going to be able to do that.
It's very happy to have a first harvest, and the next year, we're going to install more nests and increase the yield of bent-professional honey.
And that's what we're trying to do.
We're going to play our roles, and we're going to do all sorts of things.
And in September past the summer, after we completed the task of removing the nests from the hives, putting the nests into a sedimentary and filtering droplets, we were filled with bottles.
You can also see the bottles and packages of bees.
The label design was a designer, Louis Mallum, who handles Bentley's interior.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff but also is given a valuable gift to the casters and guests who visit the crew factory.
Britain values teatime.
Of course, I'd like to share a afternoon's tea with a nice bee with a bee-frying bees, like Scorn.
The Cleveland S.C.'s report of misconduct, the worst British newspaper.
After all the inconveniences, the D.O.A. has been branded as the worst in England.
The Cleveland Police are a report against injustice, and it has been identified as inappropriate in every field.
The Cleveland Police are following the "deep", says police director Phil Gomley.
The police have replaced five police chiefs in six years, and they are facing new dissolutions.
According to the report, they stopped the crime, arrested the suspect, failed to protect the weak.
"The police director, Phil Gomley, has said, "It's been a lot worse since the last time we've been investigating."
The police chief, Mike Ville, resigned for less than a year, but he was being investigated by several unauthorized charges.
The vice president, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for extremely illegal offenses.
Lieutenant Simon Harwood came to the committee for an illegal action investigation last year because he sent his colleagues to do sexual acts.
He quit the police.
Ben Hautin, chief of the Conservative Party, said: "This is the official confirmation that the police are falling."
This is when the Ministry of Interior intervenes.
The police chief, Richard Lewis, who has been improved, said he's in full responsibility for his reform."
You're a criminal. You're a criminal.
No one knows what's going to happen.
Now, I think we're involved in covert covers, and it may take a while to do research,” Perosi said to the federal legislature about the CNN.
"We're going to start a career based on time for facts and facts to be found," he said.
In the White House document released this week, Mr. Talk was able to ask President Joe Vienski of the 2020 president of the U.S. president of the United States to investigate his son.
According to the news report, Mr. Trumpet also received a request to Bar and his personal adviser, Rudy Juliani, to cooperate with the case.
Mr. Trumpet denies corruption.
More than a week ago, CNN reported that the first lawyer of the Ministry's National Security Services realized that it was the first time he noticed charges against Ukrainian Talk's actions.
The Ministry of Justice accused him of contact by informatives has decided that Mr. Trumpet's phone interviews do not appear to be in violation of political fundraising.
On Friday, Mr. Bar said that he would decide who the intelligence committee should call on the witnesses.
But Mr. Perrosi added that he thought he was a criminal.
Yes, the bar was pretty long ago.
"The last name of the bar has been given", Peloci said, and said Mr. Tlump said that he had named the director of the bar for the July interview with the Ukrainian president.
It's interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make his decision regarding the treatment of this charge.
He became very concerned that Mr. Talk would attack an informant on Thursday as a spy and say that he used to treat the spy differently.
I think the president's statement is too irresponsible and dangerous.
He said that the president's statement of who could have been informing an internal accused was grossly damaging to the government's encroachment.
He announced a formal round of ammunitions to Mr. Trumpet and wrote a historic step on Tuesday, after his suspicions of pressured foreign leaders for political advantages.
The call was published on Thursday, and the inside indictment claims that Mr. Trumpet used his power to force Ukraine's entry in the next 2020 election.
They also claimed that members of the White House's advisers have asked their members to remove their phone records from the cabinet's computer system and replace them with special classified systems.
Crystal Palress Forward, Christian Benteke, a speeding ban.
Premier League star at Premig, a couple of speed breaches in two months, is about to be banned from driving.
The 28-year-old Forward of CrystalPare admitted to driving his vent on a month 20 and running at 80 miles per hour in A3 on the southwestern London Ritchmond limit at 50 miles per hour.
In March, this Belgian man was shot by a speed-aggressor camera in Patney, southwestern London, running at over 89 miles per hour (40 miles per hour per hour).
Benteke, who lives in Kingston Hill, Sally, does not have to take a case this morning in the Court of Justice in Lavender Hill.
Benteke admitted guilty of these two violations, as well as a single plea to the judge and judge of a light crime earlier in July.
'9.2% of Taiwan’s high school students have been through this experience.
The National Health Department of Health, in accord with September 26, published a study on high school sexual experience in Taiwan.
According to this, 9.2 percent of the students said they had experience.
It also became clear that about one in five of these people didn't get pregnant.
In 2017, the study was conducted with students from high school, high school, high school, and high school.
Compared with the results of the last 15 years, the percentage of students with those who have had sexual intercourse decreased from 11.1 percent to a few.
On the other hand, 22.6 percent of 15-17-year-old men and women said they didn't get pregnant because of their recent sexual act, and they passed the last 19.2 percent.
Internations are 28.8 percent of boys and 16.6 percent of girls (equivalent to 22.6 percent), each of them have an increase (e.g., 14.5 percent).
The station points out that today’s blue boys have more opportunities to get information on the Internet and are more likely to be biased by false information.
The lack of contraceptives calls for proper knowledge not only for pregnancy but also for the risk of infections.

I'm worried about the committee structure, Kofi Manu.
Kofi Manu, a football administrator and officer at Scondy Hasakas, expressed concern about the building of the next Gurna football team (GFA) election committee.
I was asked to include the commissioner Frank Davies, and I expressed my dissatisfaction.
In an interview with the GNA sport, Manu said that the chairman was either fair or questionful as to the results of the trial and included the chairman.
The review committee should be made up of independent outside members who were previously unfavorable.
For example, Davis agreed to be a lawyer and wrote to Osei Kuwaq Pama about his discount.
He's also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu objected that his commission should not be granted.
Manu says that when he attends the committee with the relationship with his club, there will be conflict between the members of the commission, but when Mr. Palmer attends the committee, he suggests prejudice and unfairness.
The members of the committee were scheduled to end the work yesterday after the ceremony at the GFAACRA office on September 19.
The commissioner, Mr. Frank Davis, of the Corporate Gavins Consultant, and the commissioner, his lawyer and Mr. Marian Barnore, Emmanuel Dahkwar.
Other commissioners have Richard Akpocaby, attorney for sports services.
A survey by the Fukushima Corporation found that 54% of the small Fukushima companies think that it is good to pay at least $1,000 for the "a lot of money" in the country.
While 90% of the companies recruited them in the past eight years, the percentage of companies that got their schedules secured after five percent of the new, middle-aged employees, 30 percent of the non-normal, and some of the anti-month-month workers were affected by the need to save people.
The company who said "Yes" to raise to $1,000 a year was informed (00%), construction (70.6%), and distribution (6%).
The number of anti-reactions was over half the work of manufacturing (5/9%) and food, food, and shelter (60/9%) service (60/9%).
The party's director estimates that while the opposite rate is high in part and time-payed businesses, many companies think they are difficult to secure, more expensive, more expensive.
When the company said "unverse" was able to withdraw, the average wage rate was $895 (U.S.).
In March, after hearing about the adoption of the Industrial Corporation, the new income of the public was 6%, 54%, 5%, and non-normalized companies took place.
I didn't collect 8%.
The number of companies that have been able to secure their schedule has been 44/7% of their new school, 50/3% middle class, and non-normal has 3/%.
Among other things, the construction work (3.3%, 5%) and the construction work (24%, 38%) suffered agitation.
A total of 86-4% have taken the task of recruiting, and many of the competitors have asked for a low-familiar company-family price-negative condition.
Many voices have asked for help and information to assist with post-industrial initiatives (retirement within three years after graduation) and post-industrial recognition.
Some have been asked to help with the approach to students, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the country and helping with various intervening projects.
As to the side-works that the country advocates in the development strategy, 5% of the country already acknowledges it."
"I'm going to admit it" included 20% of "in the future," and "the whole third showed acceptance."
The "unrecognized" company was 64 percent, construction was 82% (82%), small-sized (73%) and production (72.7%).
The survey went to 1,000 member companies on July 9 to 2 August.
We got an answer from 298.
A typhoon that's JR back from the start of the KTN TV Nagasaki.
The JR, which was determined to drive because of the damage to the tracks by the typhoon 17, was resumed on the start of the 27th morning.
JR's Daimon-Kanaki-Daily lines, which are reopened, are usually returned from the start of the 27th morning.
JR's main railway was at the middle of the river shelf and his station.
Besides driving between bamboo pine and fast trains, the JR trains in Nagasaki had decreased, and diamonds had been disrupted.
This means that the operation was completed 26 days after the operation was completed, and after it had run a trial train on 27 days before it was finished.
Thyprick, the voice of the time before the war against the Great War.
"It's a show now," said Welsh for the war to meet the World Cup Heavens, Australia, which will decide what to do with the tournament in the future.
If Welsh wins Walabys, the hottest win in the pool D, it is likely to be the prevailing victory against France or Argentine.
On the other hand, if Australia's 14th victory against Wales, the Titanic and the team are going to win the 14th victory, they're going to be the best 8th road with England.
I mean, I'd like to challenge both teams to win over the group at the end of the day.
But it was good to win last fall.
I'm sure Australia's going to be pretty blaming you to pay your debt, until I'm going to be able to win again.
I knew this game was a pile before we got here.
And now I'm here, and this is the real show.
Welsh is a third-final decision 32 years ago in the previous World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.
And under Governor Warren Gatland, the full grade for a third team of the Southern Hemisphere is only 7 in 41.
Welsh launched a 13-year match match match in Australia last November, and Teplick included several representatives who won the match, and one of the players playing at Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
When he heard that he was not willing to win before the victory, Tiprick said: "It is hard to answer."
I'm sure the fights have been going on, and maybe we can't all win, but I don't know.
And then, in the final game, I gave you about 15 points, so I looked like a much smaller difference in score.
To win Welsh, the Australian Combibe, Michael Hooper, David Polk, and the Breakdown Battle with Tiprick are holding the key.
Tipric, who has had an experience in the 67 international convention, has been fighting with both players in the past, and he knows exactly what's waiting for.
He says, "They're certainly backers on the world level."
I always know I'm going to have a hard fight when I'm going to fight World Glass.
These two are always at the top of the world.
I'm pretty sure that's how we're gonna play this game.
Pok may be one of the world's most secure fighters, Michael's most aggressive backs, but he may be more aware of Laguby's position when needed.
I'd rather fight with the best player in the world than fight against the unarmed backrow.
I want to fight my best opponent, and if I'm fighting those two, I have to work it out myself.
This Sunday is not a final level, but it's also an important game for us in the World Cup.
It's important.
If you keep up your good performance, you'll be able to get up and lose.
"I'm going to be mad at the local community, the silence of the country, the loss of the W cup of impact, Attez.

On 28 days after arriving in Pub in the morning, the local fans stood up with their heads silently for the unexpected defeat of Ragby’s World Cup (W cup).

The match started in Ireland at almost 8:00 a.m. on the ground.

I'm going to try and find a solution to the evacuation of East Electrics, the seashore.
Tokyo's Portland District of Tokyo, 27 p.m., meeting with the small government committee discussing how to handle the processing water from Tokyo's Power Fukushima.
Tokyo's 27th day, a small government commission on the 27th day that considers the treatment of water continuing at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, has provided possible equipment and concrete procedures to dispose of true water and evacuation from the seashore as a way of disposable.
It contains radioactive matter tritium, which, in the eyes of the mind, suppresss the effects of the weather, and then stops when it detects abnormality before it gets out.
We need to know how much time we spend on the procedures presented at this meeting, when we leave Fukushima's fishing business in a state that we haven't recovered, and when we get back, it's going to make a difference.
"We should consider the social time axis."
Ben kisses the column after the Hotney bomb news
In Easters, the sudden bomb news of Hoytney Dawn (Schona MacGarty), the column of Turway, as well as the column, Ben Mitchell, was about to explode again.
But do they begin to love each other, or will they regret this hot moment?
The columns help Ben, and the needy Bobby Milner Razel have been helping him since they've been working on it, but they tell Ben that the columns have recently been weak and have been well pleased to see how nice they are.
Tonight, Hoitney comes back from vacation with a lot better than before he left.
The fact that someone was supposed to have been having an affair with a tragic wedding and a bride-bride, it was obvious that she had been very effective when she left Walterford right after she discovered that she had been unfaithful.
When Hoytney comes home, she starts talking with the column.
Soon, however, Hoytney saw new facts and swooped over the column, and the columns were astounded.
The Column is upset. Jaime Boswick is worried about watching the bands drink in Queen Vick.
The drunk, emotional column rides into Ben, and strikes everything that has happened, and blames Ben.
Ben calmly accepts the wrath of the column and comforts them, and soon they kiss each other, the peace of the column turns into passion.
But what do you two do now?
They tried to date us the next week, but Ben was given the ingredients to think about, and everything that they were trying to do with us seems to be going to work.
But the newly confident columns who stood up to their gay father decide to fight for what they want, what they deserve.
This kiss episode of Eastenter is broadcast on BBC at 8:30 on September 27-30.
If Yoshimori's business has 90% of Gala, you're sure it'll be a gift from the performers?
In a series of issues of Yoshimori business that led to the dark business of the anti-Social forces, the issue of Gala has also been rescheduled.
In an interview on July 22, President Owada Takashi said, "The company has nine turrets and no talents," and on the average, "5:5 to 6:4".
If Yoshida has 90% on the ratio of "9:1", it also appears that there was a gift from the performers to Yoshida, and the investor's observation that taxes are likely to be retweeted more than 30,000 times.
If the amount of Gala received was "9:1", what can be done with the gift tax?
I've been told by the tax collector Yokohama.
• In the meantime, the legislatures are not the object of the gift tax.
And I'm going to give you a little bit of an answer from your tax duty, as far as the Gallup Distribution is concerned.
Since Yoshimori is not an individual legal person, it is not an interest in giving taxes.
If the work is $9.1 million, then Yoshida's business is worth $1 million.
And I'm going to give you a sense of what this is.
And of course, we have already paid the tax for the tax.
And even if the performer is wondering about the distribution, he doesn't argue that the amount he actually receives is different from the amount he should make.
And I'm going to give you a little bit more money.
If you don't recognize it, you don't have to give it to someone else.
So if you're dealing with something that obviously has a price (e.g. real estate deals, for example) with something that's not really worth the real deal to avoid tax taxes, you're going to have to calculate taxes.
But you can't decide for yourself what a taxpayer is worth for what both of you did without a fight.
So let's say I'm going to pay $1.00 per month.
In 2008, after he graduated from the bank, he registered tax collectors after college.
School instructors, seminars, and authors have a wide range of jobs.
It's been well documented in a well-known theory for the Senate.
White house, bullet holes, big panic.
The White House's people are struggling against new Democratic pressure on them on Thursday, and they have explained that those who are familiar with the issue will have a feeling of "great panic" in this week for a lack of planning to deal with new realities.
The men who are close to the White House say that the accusations of the West House may have caused much damage to the president and some of his surroundings, "feeling, anxiety and anxiety" seem to rise.
The man said, "I'm not too real."
The White House officials have not only had clear plans for this situation, but they were still not sure how to proceed, as it is so serious that they could not apply what the President originally intended to do so.
One of the people who knew about the dispute said that if this retrospective was longer, the president would get more and more alarmed in the White House so that he could get more attention.
Another source said that during the rounddown, the president’s preservatives were expected to be recruited day after day and that some of the presidents are more likely to be acting as an "important" and expressed concern.
The cards are aggravated by the potential for unpredictable behaviors and severe attacks in unexpected ways, and they are concerned about the president and politics in the environment of election year.
In the face of the biggest threat in the presidential term, the cards have been attacking and altering lawyers, such as resurfaceing a strategy that he considered effective during Robert Moller's Russian investigation.
The cards tried to ignore President Ukrainian's requests to cooperate with the investigation of political opponents, to distract the Democrats and the candidates of the Democratic Party and Joe Viden, and to undermine the credit of internal accusers because of the motives of the opposition.
But while many white officials are enduring the challenge of the Molla investigation, they are now starting to feel the difference.
The president of the United States is a brand of power, but who seemed to be present at a Sunday press conference, spoke of someone who knows the situation.
Although the cards have enjoyed asking questions about Russian suspicions, it seems that they were not willing to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the underlying accusations claimed that some had no direct information about the controversial President Talk and the Ukrainian President Vorojimir Zerenski, who was convinced that the damage could be reduced to the credit of an internal accuser.
In addition, it often happens when the president attacks, but this fact increases the pressure of the supporters to defend him.
However, one of the affiliators near the White House pointed out that the president's basic support has already been very high and that it does not work to gain new supporters by amputation.
Especially if the ammunition interferes with the legislature, and will keep the news monopoly all the time."
Another source said that those who claim that ammunition can help the president have no idea how unsuspecting the response of the president is.
The alarming white house officials are asking their advisers to organize a team of ammunition responses.
According to the director of the project's project, the process is still a early process, but how is it going to work like a strategic decision room, and yet it is still not clear?
However, he said that there is a perception that organized legal strategy and communication strategies and that there is a clear leader who can organize the press in an uproar against the public document’s criticism and the fact that it has given the campaigns of the Democratic Party's campaign.
According to a source of information on the situation, the long-term strategic lack of sight reveals that Mike Pompeii and Director Steve M. M.
According to the man involved in this, Corrie Luwanski, former president of the campaign, was called the Pitbour on cards and was the head of the government's campaign.
However, Luwandoski told the NBC news that it was not accurate to suggest that he would be the leader of such a process:
"For the past five years, I have done everything I can to support the President and the policy, but I have never met the president and his side about joining a team to fight back the false story," he said.
Jay Seklow, an outside attorney for the Moller Investigation Tunes, has also been involved in the struggle for ammunition.
The NBC news reported that Seklow will handle the problem properly.
Emmett Flood, who was in charge of the Clinton Armstrong and led the White House until the end of the Morah investigation, had a less experience with the current White House's law counsel, and now there is a lack of lawyers in the White House.
Generally, the White House strategy has been well-known to say that people are far too distant to build human-to-morrows and strategic team, but they are organized, and they need people who can lead a total of cooperation and political struggle.

I was able to get a boyfriend, but, for his work, he had a long-range love for me.
"I'm gonna get married," but I can't see the goal.
What can we do to get the situation together on our side?
I heard a solution from Professor Tobai Shimpo's lecture at Japan's Highway School of Loves.
I must read the advice of Professor Higashida, who has been led out of a narrow data analysis.
I'm sorry for the trouble this time.
I'm worried if I should continue my courtship with my boyfriend while I'm in a long love affair.
I want to live in the Kansai, where I have work and home, but his office is Tokyo.

● A minority of couples get married from a distant love.
C is in love with his first year and a half boyfriend.
And I'm going to ask you, "Well, what do you mean by that?" (Laughter)
According to the report, only 16 percent of couples have been married from distant love to marriage.
Since love is something that is used in light, it's going to make you look at your partner (visory), listen to your voice, connect your hand (to your ears), smell your smell (such as smelling) and kissing.
But if you're in a long-range love, there's a lot of people who hear voices on the phone.
It's not that easy to keep going on with hearing just because of the situation.
So let's do another one.
If you go to your neighbor's house, your time and energy are burdened by traffic costs, and you're on a vacation to heal tiredness.
I'm going to be really excited when I'm going home.
- Which is, when we're far away, must we split up?
I think it's going to work if you're a couple who don't have a lot of time, even if you don't have to.
I'll get engaged a year later, or two years later, I'll be back.
It's going to be a little bit difficult if you don't see the future landing points.

It has been released from LD, CD, DVD, Blu-ray packages, and other video and music software packages.
The item with LD packages has jackets and even adornment!
For the items that put the video cassettes on the motif, the posts are attached and the contents are filled.
I haven't mentioned this yet, but there are many small items, such as passcases, record bags, and smacks.
Currently, a popular store collecting these products is also being held for a period of time.
In addition to buying products, the second round of products, LD and videos are exhibited.
I'm going to buy more than $3,000 to give you a sticker for EMOTION, so people around here need to carry their legs!
"David Nunez," "Budd's nude photo"
Representative Devin Nunes seems unbearable with the idea that President Donald Trumpet is being investigated.
On Thursday, in a comment defending the president, he blamed the Democrats for trying to get his photo.
Senator Nunes of the Republican Representative's Special Information Commission has made a conduit statement on the subject of the court's accusations against the Republican president, Joe Viden, and his son.
The Ukrainian suspected that the leftist and media asset had created a "grotesque show" and blamed the Democrats for looking at all the naked pictures of the President.
"The Democratic party of this special committee negotiated with someone who might be Ukrainian in order to get a picture of the nautical light."
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democrats are so eager to defeat the President that within a year they have the opportunity to do so.
After Nunez's scrutiny, a senior member of Huffposter, Jennifer Bendeley, decided to find out if the Republican is trying to find the truth.
The only answer I have ever answered is to ask the councillor Jim Heims of the Democratic Democratic Republic of Connecticut, if the answer is red and blue for many others.
Medit dotcomme wonders that the nudester's comment is not about more details of the controversial Still's document.

Origami, Wallet and Real Card.
- Impressed investment.
Origami Wallet is an application that allows you to transfer (to your bank account) in addition to payments by Origami Pay.
Shade features are also added.
I'm going to start financial services, such as loans, investments, insurance, and so forth.
That means you can use the financial function of paying, moving, selling, borrowing, calculating, and preparing.
The president of Origami Financial Services, the chairman of Origami Financial Services, said that he would create a new financial service that would solve the problems of a young generation that have to live in a lot of problems, such as pensions and low-interests.
Origami Wallet's advantage is that if you have Origami ID, you can complete the deal to Shimlace, and get timely information.
I also explained that not only is Origami app available but it is possible to expand it on a partner's app without an Origami app.
In terms of loans, I'm going to introduce you to the role that you can keep up with when you're making your decision.

In terms of insurance, I'm going to talk to you about the loss and the first life as a partner.
I talked to these two companies and their two partners to create data and intelligence that they're going to develop insurance products on their life event.
In addition to providing financial services, they have been able to enroll in the necessary state institutions and start and expand.
▪ New Business for Effective Usage of Data "Origami Technologies"
On the same day, Origami announced that the company, along with the digitalization of customer contacts through their refining functions, will create a "Origami Technologies" that support the effective use of data, including the data that the company owns.
Origami Network, collaboration with Origami and the refining functionality partners, is the subject of the effective use of the data, such as the creation of data and the unstructured society, and the expansion, processing and analysis of the data, and so forth.
In this case, the Origami Technologies supports unstructured data and analysis, along with the structured data that the company owns.
It contributes to the development and transformation of new business models using digital technology and data.
The president of Origami's representative, Hijikata-san, explained that "many companies are now collecting data and creating customer contacts" and "the next phase is the key to how to develop a business model using the data."
He said, "I want to put together data built on the Origami Network and create the next phases innovation.
For more information on specific services, we're going to do the following:

The biofuel research that can be regenerated could be depleted.
Although the trucks of electric cars and Tesra and the seminars have monopolized the news in recent years, it is the only flight that can reach recyclable energy.
But a professor at Alberta University has developed a technique that can be used as jet fuel for renewable biofuels.
Dr. David Bresler, professor of the Alberta Agriculture Institute of Environment, started the project in 2003.
The professor's lab is developing hydrocarbon fuel from oil oils, fertilizers, fertilizers, such as fertilizers from restaurants, cattle bricks, cannon oil, and so forth.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can be used to produce low quality oil and carbon emissions, which are less than 85% less than fuel based fuels, and can be used for other industries to waste waste waste.
This technology also works on reproducing carbon dioxide that is found in oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said that in his first generation, the technology had been achieved, and it was the carbon dioxide of the molecules in Dieselgasoline itself."
A new alternative to biofuel use, but traditional biofuels technology tends to destabilize, causing serious problems in high altitude flights.
"The problem of jet fuel is like a dilemma," said Dr. Bresler.
It's not as valuable as diesel, but there's a higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's lab now focuses on two alternatives as a jet biofuel.
First, it's a risky approach, and it's required to process different hydrocarbon fuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue to study chemical reactions that have developed a partial and low temperature and maintain the stability of fuel.
Dr. Bresler said that he could try with the reactor to change the chemical reactions a little."
This option is risky.
Aviation companies, Canada and the U.S. army are increasing their investment in renewable options, while the children of the Alberta University are working on production.
"They are predicting that someday someone will pay for the carbon tax," he said.
I'd like to make a substitute for the worst.
Today, Forge has worked in an experimental factory near Edmonton's waste management center, and has recently invested $4 million from Rockid Martin to help build a 22 million US dollar production plant in Sombr, Ontario.
The factory will produce about 9 million biofuels a year.
Dr. Bresler claims that carbon return is about 85%, but that the cost of fuel transport and production on the other side has not increased.
As a technical engineer, Mr. Bressler says:
My job is to make options so that there are multiple choices along with the decisions I have explained.

Fukushima tells her children that they especially want to have fun, and hopes that local people may be able to find attractiveness in a new community.
The goal of the crowd funding is 300,000 yen and if you didn't reach the end of the year, you're going to pay back everything.
I'm going to look for the details with a "slow".

If Boris Johnson's company is covered, Britain faces a riot like Los Angeles, the Prime Minister calls calm.
Last night a senior minister said that if the second vote subverted the outcome, there would be a danger of "a violent riot of the public" in the country.
Premier officials warned that Britain will face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequalities and the riots of citizens in the Los Angeles riot of '99.
Johnson said that he needed to calm down his anger against the political discourses he had discussed, but he insisted that he would stop using the word "destruction".
Even though the Prime Minister pleaded to restore the tranquillity, one cabinet said to the Times: "The country has never seen anything like Jirejonne or Los Angeles riot in 992".
The people do not believe that there will never be violence in this country, just because it has never happened before.
There's already a yellow best movement, so they're encrypting mobile phones to organize demonstrations, and then there are several popular leaders who use dirty hands to stir people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred after the jury sentenced to a prison sentence against four white cops who beat the king in '99, a black taxi driver, Rodney.
This year, Jonne, a French protestant in opposition to the yellow-eyed French protester, has been causing confusion and destruction in Paris for over six weeks.
He pointed out that if Britain failed to break free from EU, our credit for our political system would be ruined."
"If 30 million people voted for a national vote, 66% vote to stay in the EU," says the cabinet, "and millions of people are displeased."
Even if 99 percent of the voters refused to leave, they would be very angry to write a letter to the senator.
We don't have much time until tens of thousands of people get out of the way.
One senior minister added that if the second vote was to overthrow the outcome, there would be a danger of "a violent riot" in the country.
Johnson asks his general elections to be passed on to the rights of the Brigidt's decision.
Johnson has been reported to be facing a monstrous uprising of the House of Representatives who lower the demands for evacuation and instead seek to compromise with the EU.
Nishi Albib Bryg before the opening.
The new lagoon Alviex BB, a professional basketball ball, prayed for 27 days after the Breeg opening.
The new Albuquerque BB player and staff were eager to pray for victory in the old town of Shinto in the city of Shinto in the city of Shinobi.
Last season, the lagoon won its first district victory in the history of clubs.
But after the end of the season, the scorer, Davante Gardner, moved to another team in Brieg.
This year, we welcome new foreign athletes, Nick Perkins, to gain more grades than the district champions of last season.
Captain Kaji said it's important that head coaches raise the intensity of the speed required and the intensity of the desk in the last season so that they can gain the prize of the district champion during the last season.
The opening of the new quarry was on January 5th, at Alvark Tokyo on Away.
Life sentences for the murder of a famous brother on Pakistan's social media.
The procedure often takes longer than the execution of prison, and when the accused killer is released, the experts say the women's rights are affected by the loss of memory of the incident.
"The time is running out," said the women's rights activist, the first professor of Jendahn University in Pakistan, Faalzana Bali, adding that it took more than three years to solve the problem.
Human rights groups say it is hard to prove high reliability of data, but they found at least 300 "honorful murders" in 2008.
Many human rights advocates say that there are far more than that, but it is estimated that about a fifth of Pakistan's 5,000 honored murders occur around the world every year.
"Big Cholera Treatment". "In addition to September Correctional".
The province was reported to the parliamentary committee on September 26 to add 3600 million yen to the cost of pig cholera, and 2 million yen ($2 million, $20, U.S.) to the $20,200,000 value of land for the JR tsunami project.
It is suggested by the District Council on 27.
Let's say I have $8.7 million.
A new pig cholera, such as Tsuji, has been developed, and the province has also added three to its counts in the city of Miyagi, Miyaiya, and Shiki Prefecture to the area of the city near Tokai, where cattle trucks are currently set up in the western part of the city.
So let's say I'm going to pay $7.4 million for the relationship cost.
In addition, in order to prevent the spread of the major infectious tract, the wildebeests in the western part of the country and start to see that they are not infected with pigs and cholera.
In the central part of the country, we secure 560 million yen (560 million yen) as a fee to capture and test the 560 head.
In a judgment process based on the high-profile at Numazu Station, we add to the cost of definitive ratings and the amount of operations that are involved with the committees enrolled.
According to the Ministry of Regional Affairs, the province and Numazu were accepted by the state's request for the release of unleaded land on the 8th.
In the future, the petitions are being taken to the Numazu City Ministry's office on October 3-7, and before the end, judgment will be expected to begin immediately.

A flood and chaos caused by the long-term monsoons in many parts of India.
India's Monsoon season has increased almost months, with unprecedented rainfall causing buildings to fall, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Normally, Monsoons in the north of India are weak at the beginning of September, but this month’s average rainfall has increased by 37 percent.
According to experts from the Indian Essential Institute, if the situation continues for a few days, the monsoon will be weakened by the slowest period of decades.
In many parts of India, unprecedented rains have yet to come, and the latest news is that in punnas in western India, buildings have collapsed on Wednesdays and Thursdays, killing several people and killing a lot of people.
Houses are flooded, residents are caught in the water, and people are usually seen in the end of the monsoon.
Other cities, such as Corcata, Laknau, and Hyderabad, have also had heavy rains.
In the northern state of Uttararacand, heavy rains have caused massive damage to homes.
The monsoon arrived too late.
In many areas, water was scarce, and farmers were prepared for drought.
Monsoon is not good for farmers.
This rainfall is not normal at this time.
The small-scale farm farmer Plakhash Mehhara of Bhatat, Uttar, now makes cabbage, beans, end-wine, tomato, but rain makes the vegetables rot.
The slower, less powerful monsoon influences the consumers, the higher the price of talons who can't cook in India.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, on the other hand, the onions of Tampai (23 Peninsula) are usually sold for 80 rupees (about a pound).
The festivals are in danger.
The next big festival is Dashira, on October 8, where Hindus have installed Ravana, the man of evil laughter in the mammick book style, the 'Ra Marana', a huge cookbook doll.
Burning Lavana means that good has destroyed evil.
But the dolls are made of paper, so if the monsoon is long enough, the last thing we call ravana is Lavana.

And we're going to talk about the risk of heart disease, heart disease, and heart disease, which are going to increase the risk of exposure to a large amount of chemicals.
Recent studies show that working around high concentrations of chemicals can increase the risk of heart disease.
This is the result of over 30 surveys of the daily American cloop in Hawaii.
Researchers have found that when compared with a group of men who didn't work around pesticides, the risk of heart disease and heart attack increases 45 percent.
“The research highlights the importance of using personal protective equipment, writing in medical records of work abuses, and suppressing standard risk factors for heart disease,” says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, a colleague of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of senior medicine at Hawaii University in Manoa.
This is the result of a study of data obtained from more than 6,000 men living in Oahu, who participated in the Kakani Honolulu Heart Program.
The study, the researchers say, may not apply to women and other species.
Since pesticides have been a half-life period, the health effects may have been revealed over the years.
In this study, the biggest impact has been in the last 0 years.
"In 34 years of pursuit, the exposure of chemicals at work and heart disease and heart disease are no longer important," said Dr. Rodriguez in an press release.
This is because the importance of other factors associated with high age has increased to the point that it conceals the potential relationship between pesticides and heart disease in the night.
Researchers have found that exposure to low and medium-level pesticides and heart disease, heart disease, and heart attack are not important to heart disease.
Polochenko's office at the Zerenskito lamp conference.
It was a very mutant week for Washington's political issue.
I wanted to avoid being swallowed up by political scandals for the first political mastermind Vorojimir Zerensky.
But what has been discovered about the Zerenskito phone problem, and how extensive it has been on the Serenskie?
At the beginning of the call meeting, Talmud told Zerensky that the United States has had a lot to do with Ukraine before other European countries.
Although the White House's phone records are not synonymous, it is detailed that the cards focus more on the subject than on the physical proposals of the Prime Minister Angela Merkel himself and other European leaders.
Zerensky's response to a 100-% opposition to cards is considered a topic of controversy.
Zerenski added that the President of MacChange and Melkel have not been able to provide enough support in Ukraine.
The conversation was inspired, politicians, particularly the Ukrainian factions argued on social media.
Ukrainian President Petro Polochenko posted on Twitter that there was no previous support received from the EU.
In addition, Polochenko tweeted that she was grateful for the support of the EU's Russian regime and financial aid in the Russian invasion of Russia.
Other politicians have expressed concern about Ukrainian politicians, Victoria Votitisan, who said, "Can you negotiate with Germany and France again?"
Tricket asks for two investigations, not for military aid, but for Zerensky, one of which suggests that the Ukrainian government was involved in violation of civil e-mails during the campaign in 2016, and is investigating the servers of the National Council of Democrats who were hacked.
This could hinder European relations, or is it inaccessible to take back water against France and Germany's heads.
I don't want to talk shit about anybody.
“Thanks to those who are helping to help us with the announcement of the call report,” Zerenski told the UN meeting in New York.
Zerensky will meet with the head of Russia, Germany, and France at Normandy 4 Summit, which is scheduled for October.
Ghana, the International Commerce Agency wins two prizes.
Ghana won the honor two awards at the 40th International Air Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
This safety award has been awarded to Ghana’s temporary performance of 89.89% and administrative aviation directors in Africa.
Prior to this, the ICAO was following the World Security Council report on the United Nations Airlines and was finishing the curriculum for the ICVM (I.V.M.) on April 3, 1919.
Security awards have been found to follow the criteria and agreements that IICAO recommends on the airport and the safety of the country's country.
These awards were created in support of the behind-the-going national Zero Campaign campaign in ICAO.
In addition, security ratings for "6 certificates and security ratings" have given seven certificates to the ICAO country where security standards have been improved.
The award was won by Minister Joseph Kofi Adagarna, director of the General Air Force General General Simon Alote Ghana, Minister Nii Ikoi Ottawa, and Ambassador of Canadian Garna, Yaw Kuwakawakwarport Company.
In his speech, President Ormíwa Belinard Aliu of the International Journal of National Aeronautics stressed the need for security in the country:
The president said that it's always important to realize that air safety, security, and sustainability are still the most basic issue in this period of innovation."
And Ada said that the award was a complement of Sector’s steadfast efforts and patience, and that Ghana's effort was a gift.
He also pointed out that the airline's potential for dramatic changes in our lives is a large number of future opportunities for developing domestic economy.
In them is the profit of the community, and all of them are safety and security which We have achieved.

Mr. Thompson, Peter Gayno, president of FEMA.
On April 3, 1919, deputy Secretary Peter Gayno of the United States U.S. Federal Emergency Administration (FEMA) smiled at the FEMA bill of 20 years in the National Security Council's hearing hearings in Capitol Hill, Washington, U.S.A.
The White House has announced that the President of the United States, Donald Talk, appointed Mr. Peter Gayno to the Führer of Emergency on Thursday.
Gaynor, the vice president of FEMA, was in his position as deputy director of government disaster measures, such as hurricanes and mountain fires.
It's been in the state of the Senate since the discharge of former Director Brock Long.
The Department of Home Security, the FEMA's top organization, declared that Long was misinterpreted in government travel between Washington and North Carolina.
The other recommended, Jeffrey Baad, was suspected of being drunk and involved in a struggle with alcohol, and was removed from the idea at the end of the month.
Mr. Gayno was expected.
From now on, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Before he was appointed vice president of FEMA in 2018, the White House said Gayno was in charge of the Emergency Management Department in Rhode Island and there was a Marine.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down the illegal marijuana buffeting of San Gabriel Valeri.
Elmonte - Police shut down the illegal marijuana Baypin movement in San Gabriel Balley on Thursday.
After the police issued a search warrant for the illegal marijuana-nap market, the police began at 4:37 p.m., and a large container of vtanani oil was found in the office building, 9600 blocks on Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Kano of Elmonte Police said he also found the equipment for the investigators to load the Bay Cartr.
"It's very dangerous," said Lieutenant Cano.
Lieutenant Cano once engaged in a drug investigation and said it might be a fire in the process of extracting oil from beep products.
"There's a chance that just the quiet electricity from your clothes could be fired out, and because of the concentration, it will cause fires and explosions."
And if there are multiple containers like that, one after the other, the whole building could be blown off.
The danger squad was called in to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The price of the items that were seized and the prices of the equipment were not released immediately.
The investigator said that he received an anonymous tip that led to a warrant for the crime scene where he found a illegal activity.
Our agents are still trying to figure out who's behind the illegal Baep operation.
The police said that the office was an empty house, so they think that the man had set up a store in their office.
While the investigation continues, the police received recent news, particularly about the dangers of Bayping, asking to avoid coming back with illegal Baypining products.
"I don't know what I'm talking about," he said.
It may be mixed with other toxic substances.
That may cause much harm to our community and our children, and so the police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
There was a massive earthquake of 6 degrees Celsius during the concert!
Evacuation training in the Hall of Miyaga.
In the event of an earthquake during the concert, a practical form of evacuation was conducted at the Hall of Miyaga City.
This training held every year.
Onstage, it is assumed that there was actually a performance by the Miyagi Daiga Guard, with six strong earthquakes on the way to the song.
On 27 days of training, about 300 people participate in kindergarten, community, and hall staff.

One of these shrouds placed there a hundred years ago on the wall of a small rural church, Mr. Lynn saw it as part of his dress that had been lost from the clothes of the world's clothing.
Three years after Mr. Lynn happened to find this magnificent cloth of the church that was used as the altar of Baxton in Helefordshire, the dress of Elizabeth was lost next month in the Hampton Court court, where the Tuider's queen might have been used more than 450 years ago, she would be exhibited near the room.
"The only one left in the sixth-century dress was the most important discovery in the entire Royal Dollar collection."
Although there's no complete evidence that Elizabeth was wearing the dress, the experts have been convinced that the dress is not part of the royal property for three years.
"The most expensive fabric of silver thread," by law, was provided only by the superior members of the royal room." "The best plant and flowers stooges were later added to the deer, the dog, the butterfly, the fisherman, the bear's designs suggest that the former owner was a noble man.
At the time the dress was produced, it seemed to be worth the equivalent of one of the Tüder residences.
In addition, in the late 1590s, the queen may have been threatened by other women in the palaces and may not have been patient with such magnificently dressed rivals.
Since Mr. Lynn is important to publicize, he also has come to see a colleague's expert.
I've always been so happy to say, "Wow, I'm sure you're looking at one of the Royal dresses."
It seems unlikely that one of the long garrisons used as the altars of the Unvisited St. Faith Church in Bakuton seems to have been cut short.
In the village of Blanche Parry, who served as a female officer for the long years of Queen Elizabeth, the local legend reports that the cloth has long been linked to Parry.
Although the dress was later than Paul’s death in 1590, experts think it must have been a family memorial or church before Elizabeth died in 1603.
Among the 400 hours of fixation, the festival beds, which were specially used for silver and a very delicate hand-skin needles, are scheduled to be displayed next to a picture of the modern paintings that have been borrowed from the Hatfield House during the exhibition, with similar dressings.
The only space that can be used to cover part of a very expensive tapper is the renovated room in the Hamptoncoat area, where saving work is done, and Libby Thompson, who guided the work, said that when he handles a historical fabric, he feels real respect for the art of the workers who make it.
Look at the tattoos on the front and back, the people who built them have a tremendous respect for them.
I've never seen one of these more sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition has been held on October 12th in the Hampton court palace.
"From Missing Women's Search for Subtitles", the self-defense was relocated in a week, and the volunteer man was also missing.
A week after the disappearance of a young girl in the camp in Yamada.
Still no clue, the vigilante has completed 28 days of search and has been resuscited.
The following week, the search for Kunihito Prefecture began with a system of about 240 police and guards at 6:00 a.m.
However, the village asked the vigilante to evacuate the area they asked to search for, and the search was terminated in noon.
The Vigilante sent 6650 into the center of dangerous places, such as mountainsides and glaciers, from 25 to 4 days.
The 20-year-old man who joined the search for a volunteer for 27 days had no idea what he was doing, and we haven't been able to find him.
The police and the security policy continue the search at 6:30 a.m.
I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do.
The first trial that the votes were required to cancel elections was held in Tokyo's Tokyo Mishnah, Japan, and the next day, as a violation of the court's decision.
According to the court's decision, this year, the Senate has voted an election against only 0.71 vote in Miyazaki, and only 0.48 votes in Kagoshima province, compared with the lowest number of votes per member in the country.
The first proposition on the 27th day of the 27th day of the Fukushima Nagasaki section claimed that the value of one vote was incompatible and unconstitutional.
In response, the district election board requested that the defendant's decision be dismissed as a constitutional decision, even though it was not in the case of a clear and unequal situation that could lead to the issue of the constitution.
The sentence will be handed down on October 30.
A conference by the Representatives.
From the left.
On 27 days, a press conference was conducted by the Japanese National Association of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo’s 1000th Regional district of Tokyo by the Korean School of Independence.
We've met three members of the conference's delegation, Yuji's lawyer, and Yokohama's kindergarten school.
Representatives called it "unscientific discrimination" because of the anti-abortion system that took place on October 1 and the removal of 88 schools, including the Korean schools.
East Certificate, at the end of the morning, $20,000, U.S. stock security.
Tokyo’s stock market average (225) has been greatly reduced by 27 days.
The previous day, the US stock security went up, and the lower rate exceeded $300 per hour, and the price was about two weeks old.
It's also a lower factor in the order to sell to the semiconductors.
The end of the morning is $268.25 for the last day.
The TOPIX (TOPIX) is "597-52" at 25-75.
The previous day, the New York market was aggravated by the US government's chaos over the President of the Troops, and the Dau’s 30-money stock market has closed down and has finished the deal.
On 27 days, Tokyo’s markets have also taken over the tide.
The "Max" is the "No" world.
Even abroad, there are some popular pictorials and Guzzz.
I'm going to ask you a question.
Since it's been open to Yokohama and on the kitchen, "I've been collecting stories" are going abroad.
It's a time period between October 2020 and January 2020 that has been open to China Shanghai.
SHANGHAI's plaque is one of the largest places in the past (703m2) than on Yokohama kitchens.
Content, like the country's nuisancem, is made up of four areas of the "Understanding Area of the World's Flying Clouds":
Some people have been aware of this good thing before, and they say, "What do you mean, it's cute?

SAN FRANCISCO, CA (French only), Long Beach Convention Center, 3th St.
Tokyo Motor Show 2019, Yahoo!
At Tokyo's Auto Big Show 2019, which will be held from October 24 to November 4, Tokyo's Main Street, the biggest truck truck "Gig" has first been published world wide.
Squirt's fragrant model, Giga's new system of energy-sufficiency equipment, along with the latest forward safety equipment.
The pedestrians and bikes are also detectable by precrush brakes, the right turn-offs, the Brain spotter monitors that support the refrigeration of the wheels, and the modifiable LD headlights that support the changes.
Also, the driver's fatigue decreases due to the Cruz and the new hieroglyphic cavity that will be followed by all trains on the road at full speed.
Also, MIMAMORI's MIMAMORI system of transportation travel and mobility management also expands the vehicles conducives.
The security system's new monitoring and responsibly collapsing.
The World Premier has also described the future's current network as a show model.
FL-IR looks at the similarity between ultrasound conversations and behavioral behaviors, such as fish, and connectives and gang-run lines.
The Extreme takes in bio designs that gave Mociif an efficient robot image, and puttings it in front of a organic shape that cuts the wind, and assigns the contrast to the hardest aero device around it to be a characteristic of style.
Interior changes manually auto-driving mode to allow the dashboard to replace the layer design.
The sheets are located at the center, with a comfortable operation and a resilience.
Similarly, the world's first public will be "ElFEVWWALLs Luvan".
Of course, the zero missions and low noises are based on the structure of the Waxlulu structure that has been achieved by the EV and are also concerned about the efficiency of driver labor and distribution work.
The driver's car supports the movement by carrying a rotating sheet.
We also have a 3D round marker that can be monitored around a wide range of electronic mirror systems and vehicles.
Another example is that the first hibid syndicate bus ever developed by the Sunbae, the first hieroglyphic bus in the country's combined country, and the small truck that has made extensive improvements, Elf, from the Diesel4JZ1 engine, which has managed to deal with the latest emissions control and to double the cost.
Also, we're going to show video and paneling how we're working on the PREISM (playsim) and how we're going to deal with natural gas cars.
In the family space, you can arrange for touch panels and photo booths that can be viewed on video and that can be track drivers.
I arrived at the space base, and I got caught in the robot arm, as well as at Attez.
We've arrived at the International Space Station with an unmanned supply machine like this.
The robot arm at the station from the bottom left is growing (NASA provided)
The International Space Station has succeeded in catching the 8th Company and congratulated JAXA officials = 28 days (JAXA).
This is the "non-communication machine that carries supplies to the international space station at an altitude of about 400 miles [400 km].
Reserves were launched from the seed island space center in Kagoshima, on the 25th day, and gradually advanced by control of the JAXA wave space center.
We're going to be able to fly at the same speed as the station, and we're going to lose speed, and we're going to get about 0 meters.
It's a seven-millimeter robot. It's a wave of reinforcements.
Reserves carry about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After we've got it to the station, the astronauts will take out the package.
I was involved in a third of the U.S. drugs.
CBS news just after the Chicago Wesside Day arrived, it took a rush hour of drug trafficking.
I made it clear what the DDEA's doing all day long.
Last year nearly 800 people in Chicago died of overdose.
Maxine said that 9% of the drugs were taken in Chicago were taken from Mexico.
DEA is looking at the Mexican drug king named Nemescio Selfbantes, who is known as El Mencho.
"Agent agent Matthew DonhaudezDEA in Mexico said Mencho is the first person to ask for D.A.A.'
I'm going to pay you 10 million dollars for El Mencho.
With Danahe's help, dozens of El Mencho's pharmaceutical compounds in the jungle have been exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartels, NJNG, are involved in at least three of the drugs brought to the United States by land and sea.
According to the Attorney General, the cartel has smuggled a lot of "cocaine, methane fetamine, fentanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's head costs 10 million dollars.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but he was arrested and taken back to Mexico on a drug charge.
So I started a violent drug cartel.
Lots of weapons, carrying rockets, 50 pellets.
Dona Huh said he actually owns his own special planes.
El Mencho is not punished for defending his empire until he is involved in public execution this summer from the Mexican army strike of six dead.
In recent years, thousands of homicides have been responsible for the drug cartel struggle.
According to the Mexican government's statistics, there are about 94 homicides per day.
In Chicago, Mexican drugs are so toxic that they should be treated with protective clothing.
In the manufacturer's bag of cocaine, there are marks of a smuggler.
The more than three minutes are considered El Mencho's drug cartels.
'Mencho is involved in the introduction of toxic substances that are practically stealing the lives of innocent women and children'
I mean, when someone's child died, it could be a drug from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67 million Americans died of overdose.
"Atttez, the Osaka Temple Zoo, we've been recycled to the United Kingdom for a few years."
A man rented to the British zoo for breeding is "Arca" = 28 days, a dynasty zoo in Osaka, Osaka.
Children who have written at Koala "Arku's Transportation Day = 28 days, the dynasty zoo in Osaka, Osaka.
On the 28th day of the Osaka Temple Zoo, Osaka Shibuya held a reunion of the only male koala arc in Osaka.
In mid-January, "to the British zoo in mid-Japan, it must be borrowed for '0 years, and it may not come back.
Thank you. Good luck.
About 600 visitors gathered in front of the koala, where Yuka is alive, leaving behind.
Ark is two years old.
Koala's life span is 5 to 20 years, and it's expected that he will complete his life in England with his son-in-law.
I'm a nurse, Mr. Kawaguchi, and I'm crying, "I don't want to put a curtain on the koala farm, thanks to you."
Sonny, play station 4 surprise news.
Sonny has disclosed the content of the PS4's scheduled PS4's Rast-Obs-Apartment Ass.
As part of a recent state-of-the-art presentation, Sonny announced the release date of February 2020 in the sequel of the Rast of Ass.
Some videotapes of the newly created action game have also been presented to fans.
A few days later, the news of the great news of Rast-Ob-Ass 2 has been published.
Sonny and Notty Dogs have been back in many ways.
Rast of Ass Part 2 has not seen much since the days of the PS1.
In an amazing series of telegraph reports, the North Dog Nile Drackman even announced that the series has evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"In a different way, stories are magnificent and complicated," said Dracman.
He wanted to make it bigger if there were so many characters to tell his story.
I didn't plan to play the biggest game in history, but I was finally going to get there.
"I've been wondering how much this story is happening, and the user has felt that this is the end, but it really is the beginning, and all the sections are starting."
The game was so majestic and one blueray not entered, and it became two disks.
Another Rast of Ass Part 2 says that if you open up at work, there are two of the less than one East Eggs (Gamespot via).
I don't want to ruin this surprise, but Ester Egg at the game has a long-term sleigh connection.
If the Rast of Ass Part 2 was released in the P.4 limit, you'll know a lot more.
If you have PS4, you should pick up the Lass of Ass Masterd with the aid of a series of releases.
Sonny recently published a free PS4 game, including the work mentioned earlier, in October 1919.
MLBza Shot19 will be sold to the PPS plus members in October.
If Las Ove Ass Masterd likes and wants to get ahead of him, Sonny has already published multiple versions of the game, including the special version of Ellie's backpack and the bracelet, and 12-inch Jujua.
The Council will save you from moving to Mount Fuji, and the people will continue to want the news.
The development has begun to take place on the Bicycle Island, where trades have decreased, on the 26th day of the life of the population, and on the 23th anniversary of the development of the Climate and Consultation Council.
"In a test since February, a wagon loaded with sun, flavor, and food went around the city's assembly and Hana-san City for the first time.
Some of the products that were sold more than anticipated were quickly replenished, and the residents said they'd continue asking that they'd be able to choose items that would be fun.
The van was loaded with zero points, such as the whole city's bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat an old man, all kinds of pottery in a pack, and all kinds of vegetables, like '00 yen and '00', so that they can't be eaten alone.
At the town council, there were rows of people, salt and sugar completely sold.
"I didn't think this was going to be sold".
Takashi Takashi-san, who is usually buying his husband's driving car, was excited that his price was cheap and convenient, and he didn't know how long he could drive and continue.
They also asked me to fill a can, not a cup of coffee, but a cup of coffee that I would drill for myself."
The Council will consider what is wanted.
In Sri Lanka, only a place where you can buy daily goods is a combini store, where the council tried to move to save the “needs”.
"Before February, 20 towns across the island will be able to continue as business after the next year."
The Prime Minister Scott Morrison has declared that he has decided to assist some 10 billion more people who have lost their lives.
The drought-shaped farmers ’ cash policy has been extended, and existing farmers have been greatly revised for their simplicity.
In addition, about $34 million is estimated to be in the dry land of the Indigenous Services, where farmers receive an extra $3,000 emergency assistance.
As a program of drought-sharing districts, upheld ten million dollars of dry relief for infrastructure maintenance and drought control.
In addition to the added support, the government has already budgeted over seven billion dollars as a dry aid.
Ronald Lee Haskell: In Texas, he tried to murder his ex-wife's family.
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted of murdering Steven, Katie Stey, and four of his five children in Spring, Texas.
On July 9, 2014, the authorities said that Haskell entered Mr. Suit's house and questioned his wife Melanie Haskell's location.
Miss Melanie was away, but she and her sister Katie Stey had a family.
Hasskell fired and announced that his 13-year-old, 13-year-old son, nine-year-old, and seven-year-old daughter, died, according to the Hallis County Police Department.
Only one member of the family survived his life when he was 15 years old.
At the time, the authorities reported that Qasy was badly injured, but then they recovered completely.
On Thursday, all the jurors unanimously resigned their charges against Ronald Lee Haskell.
The jury was dismissed until Monday's qualification.
If you choose to disappoint us, you will never forgive us.
Did the woman's complaints against her indignation sound to the leaders of all the nations who live there?
Earth's warming will increase the seriousness of the planet.
At the Summit of the United Nations Climate Activity in New York, he spoke to a six-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunbelli from Sweden in order to strengthen his measures.
I've been a ignitor to spread the school strike around the world, such as bobbing classes and sitting in front of the council.
Youths who have recruited concerns and turbulence have protested in different parts of the world, including Japan.
It is estimated that some 4 million people have joined in over 50 countries.
We even marched on the message board in Kyoto.
The threat of climate change is near.
The International Union of Paris, which began in 2020, is the goal of putting global greenhouse gas emissions in real meaning in the later part of the century and less than two degrees of temperature before the industrial revolution.
In developed countries, we will take steps that will allow all of our participation to take place together, regardless of where we live.
However, unusual elephants throughout the country are linked to temperatures, such as high temperatures and heavy rains.
It's going to require a lot of effort to keep warmer and faster.
In the summit, which was achieved by the U.N. Secretary - General Gutrez, who's in a crisis - expressed the long-term goal of 77 countries to make real zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries thought they were going to get their targets up.
Meanwhile, besides the United States who is withdrawing from the Paris agreement, China and India have failed to show up on new goals and have become the focal point of the movement of the exodus.
Japan’s criticism of coal-powered electricity is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy offers as soon as possible a half-century emissions zero, but the gap between countries aiming for 50 years and zero is larger.
I didn't have the opportunity to speak to Japan in the summit.
Kaji-san, who has presented Japanese efforts at the environmental conference, said he should be happy, cool, and sexier in an interview with climate change.
The apeil powers do not deny, but they are too poor to sue for girls.
I'm not in opposition to Mr. Greta, who was now a symbol of environmental movement.
The uncontroversy of the middle hurt will be nothing more than a "returning the argument" that people object to.
There is no longer any time for global warming, and international communities must respond to the crisis common to humans.
There's no hope of any real effectiveness in each country's efforts.
There are many young people behind you, children.
You should act so that you don't take that future away from them.
I'm going to go back to the quantum Internet.
As a result of the American Army's research, I got closer and closer to the beginning of the quantum Internet.
The Internet could have provided military security, measurement and timing functionality that were never possible for the conventional networks.
According to the Innsbruck University researchers have reached a record of physical and light quantum contouring transports, 50 kilometers [50 km] from light-filling cables.
Integration is the correlation that is generated between the quantum bits and the body.
If two quantum bits are in the entangular state, and one is measured on one side, then the measurements on the other can affect even if the quantum bit is physically distant.
"This distance [50 km] is more than a two-digit distance, and it's a real distance to start a city-quantum network than it was ever possible," says Dr. Ben Laño, a laboratory researcher at the University of Innsbruck, who has been successful with the information.
The urban quantum network, which is made up of physical bits in the state of entangul, is a network of physical quantum bits.
Researchers say that the distribution of entangularism is absolutely essential for the formation of the quantum Internet.
"This is a huge step in bringing about a mass distribution model" by Dr. Sarah Gambler, vice president of a military program that supports the research.
Entanglements on the exit through the fiber also maintain sufficient quality to meet the needs of some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with carcinosium atoms caught in the Iontrap.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum conditions on the ion and encourage them to release the quantum information at the same time.
The result is the calculative state of the atom and the light particles in the entangular state.
The task is to send the light to the light cable.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from Carciium Ion is 854 nanometers, and soon it will be absorbed into light fiber cables.
So, in his team, we sent that photo particle through a non-linear crystal, which was fired by a strong laser.
The wavelength of photons has been converted into the optimum of long-distance transfers - to 1550 nanometers, with the standard wavelength of current remote communication.
Then we sent him over the light favela cable, 50 kilometers (50 kilometers) long.
As a result of measurements, atoms and light particles were still in the entangular state, even though they moved long distances with the shape of the wavelength.
"Calciium is used to capture a high-quantum quantum bit, so the result of this experiment leads to the fulfillment of the entancing network of long-range atomic clocks.
The massive entangular clock network is a very important area for the army from the face of its exact position, navigation, and time application.
