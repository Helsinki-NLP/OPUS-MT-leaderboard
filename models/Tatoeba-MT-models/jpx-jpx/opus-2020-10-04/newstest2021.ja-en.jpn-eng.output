Of course, Robinson, the Rigg Stumpter, is an important part of the stepup of the hero, the Draft’s 13th name, and of course.
The hero misses 15 games between February and March, and the last season of the 12th Hurnetz War after his return.
The hero was able to take back 100% of the time that he had, but he was more persuasive than he was in the newspaper, although he said, "I feel the best feeling I've ever felt."

Six musicians from Fukushima met together to create a message song.
On the way to recovery from East Japan's earthquake and Tokyo's Fukushima Powers Triumphing with the new corona virus, I'm writing adjectives of Fukushima Prefectures.
Influences the people of the province, finishing the full version by the summer of the disaster, by the end of the next year.
On the 20th, they published the song on the video page "Youtube".
The song's name is Fukushima.
It brings a bright, healthy melodie with a desire to communicate with people's front posts from Fukushima.
The new corona’s influence has driven the concert house to rest and many musicians have lost a place to sing and play.
That's why the DAZU-O(37) was created by Mehkali Boys, who tried to believe in the power of music, but who lived in Nanaka, Nappo, and Dhazo, who is living in the city's music group.
Nappo handles the rap.
As the project began on March of the Colona disaster, Singer Songgwriter Manummi from Fukushima (28) and Nagai (38) were in agreement with each other in an instant.
Ms. Nappo has become an extravagant face that we cannot think of at normal times.
We did not have the opportunity to gather sixty-six people as a means of infection, and each was recorded in live homes and homes.
In an attempt to force the project backward, the artist of the city put down an image character.
Through the Fukushima region, they represent a natural climate: blue and green.
The song was completed in YouTube, and the CD was aimed at.

Two new infections in the city of Corona.
It turns out that a new male in São Paulo had been infected with a new corona virus in his 50s and 60s.
The infection has been confirmed by men in the 50s and 60-year-olds living in Sendai.
According to Senzhou, the 60-year-old man was working with the same company, a 20-year-old female employee who was identified with the infection on 23 this month.
This month, 25 days of infections have been confirmed against such symptoms as headaches and diarrhea.
Another 50-year-old man has been diagnosed with a headache such as "9/9" and has been diagnosed as 25 days of infection.
I'm not sure the infection route was where the men came in this middle of the month.
So we've got 42 infected people in the province.

"I want to know quickly where the disaster and the accident occurred!"
This is not only for news organizations, such as television and newspaper, but also for many companies, such as social infrastructure and the government.
The service that responds to it is the "Spectee" created by AI working on information analysis.
A team of experts from Specti will be able to prove the true truth of social media information.
Now, the first way people can get to know the disaster and the disaster is started to communicate online from television.
Twitter and other social media have become important media to send information right after the disaster or accident has taken place.
It is hard for men to keep an eye on the information that is open and to extract useful information from it.
Speciality has been able to detect natural disasters and accidents from social media reports such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and have a role to monitor them and then distribute them to the companies as they prove the information's true truth.
Standing at the "Social Actual Directors of Treasury" (O.K.A.) is a risk management service that highlights the various dangers that exist in the country.
The NHK of the bear earthquake in April 2016 was the first major use of spakty, and the initiative soon spread between companies.
More than 350 internal agencies are now using specialty, including television and newspapers, as well as social infrastructure, such as electricity, gas, and transport, and all over the country.
▪ Analyze posts to determine the type of crisis and where it occurs.
Spousy delivers information with four steps: "parses and content categories," titled, "False Test".
Using companies predefined critical categories, such as the region where information is collected.
Specti collects a post that corresponds to the specification using API provided by social media.
Next, text, images, videos, and classifications that are collected in the posts.
If, for example, there's a detonation vehicle, there's black smoke coming out of the building, and there's orange flames coming out of the room, then it's classified into the fire.
Other pictures of the car receded, traffic accidents, and pictures of the watered road are classified like a road cap water.
Specti also estimates where disaster and accidents occur.
"I often don't know where to find it, so I'm estimating all kinds of information together," says village CEO.
For example, if images and videos show signs of street signing and signs of signing, you can extract the names from them and identify them with the local database.

A thousand people from Tokyo, near the city of Higashida.
I've been living in the province for 30 years since I was born.
The word "sleep" means "talk" when I used to talk to my college friend, I was immediately made a kiyoton.
You know what it means with the flow and the language, but you said, "You don't use it from the people of Tokyo.
Are you sure you're going to roll in with the Zulu?
It's going to be a little bit more complicated than it is going to be.
Then there's another one.
I didn't realize that the word "my home" was not used at all in reading books, but I was kind of told when I was grown up that I didn't want to listen to my friends.
- What, "mothers"... did you?
I used my locals, but I didn't realize when I was growing up, I wasn't using them as natural.
The Chinese don't wear the "frequent" Chinese?
"Breaky, sour food" is a popular game.
China's cold Chinese Chinese are called "Day Cold Fungus."
As noted at the outset, Chinese Chinese Chinese are based on the Chinese cooling surface ("Jananbanmien/cold mixing").
Therefore, they do not exist in China, but the diversity of food has made them appear in Japanese restaurants in the summers.
Also recently, a range has appeared in the daily system of combining: ‘Dirty Corners,’ and, "White Chicken Cruciality and Chiguchi Cold Climate".
On the other hand, they were pushed by drifting punches, such as Shikoku and Singing Lake, and the popular Chinese festivities in China are not quite as high as the Chinese festivities in China.
Of course, the Chinese are often very familiar with their daily tastes.
It does not taste bad, but it is likely that low introverts will cause them to be persecuted.
China is not the exception. It is still a minor.
As a result, China's Chinese name is "Day Cold Fungus".
The Chinese are recognized as one of Japanese cooking.
In the summers, we're set for the skin.
I don't know if it's cool.
In Japan, many people are not familiar with the shrubs, which are made of rice flour, rice, and detonation.
It is said to have been a history for 2,000 years.
The price is between 10 and 200 US dollars a year.
There's a letter called "soft," but it's not ice cream like the Japanese Chinese Chinese.
It's not just constant temperature.
Sprinkling the various ingredients, such as cucumbers, carrots, palms, and so forth, over the cane.
Finally, specially seasoned, mixed with oil, ra oil, vinegar, vinegar and peanut paste.
Your throat is well-filled, your palate, and rich fatty tweaks often entangle you, and even when you're not eating the summer bee-sweet, you're squeaking in.
Also, because of the spread of China, there is a variety of twigs and flavors, and the abundance of variations is one of the delights.
I'm an expert.
"Freshwater shower" comes from the body and the heart.
I can control the hemorrhage of muscle pain.
A study of the effectiveness of hydraulic therapy published in The North American Journal of Medicine found that the effects of physical and mental healing can be expected.
By taking cold water after exercise, it seems that it is possible to control muscle pain and other pneumonia.
Professor Douglas Kassa, who is the head of the Institute for Sports Medicine, who teaches at Connecticut University, says that it is important to exercise, to take a cold shower for as long as possible.
Reduce fatigue.
A high temperature movement usually requires more blood flow in the heart, muscle, and skin.
"When you exercise, there's more blood flow to your heart, and more muscle flow is needed to contract muscles.
"The cold shower will reduce the flow of blood from the skin to the lower temperature of the skin, and instead, it will send blood to the internal organs, such as your stomach intestines, so it will make it easier for you to eat water and nutrients after exercise.
Expected Hormisises Effects
Drossifsky can also tell us about the effects of the "hormism effect" by bathing cold water.
The effect is that the body should have a little more harmful substances and stress than nothing else.
The cooling shower stimulates hormones and neurotransmitters and increases physical and physical strength and recovery.
Sportportporter, Osaka Shimbun, and two teams of bikes, Attez.
I'm going to take a sports sergeant's lease.
On 24 days, Shioka has commissioned two bicycle racing teams in the eastern part of the region to "Sportporters" in a 'could cooperate in sports campaigns in the province.
Team Bryanson Sicing on Triy Island and Revantefji Shimbun.
A team of Brisbane Sicing, a team member of the Daiichi Daiichi Daiichi Prefecture on Yakuma Highway in Taipei, Japan, took a team to create a bicycle competition with the state's people.
Revantefji Kazakhstan received a passlet from the director and district strategie director.
2nd row, Osaka Hirohito.
I'm looking at Yahoo!
(Se Rigg, 2-5) Mt. Osaka, 7 fights, 4 defeat, 24 days, 4th Nagoya D.)
The high ball hits the left wing stairway.
The Great Mountains release two battles of arches and round the diamonds.
Returning to the bench, I put a white tooth on it.
"I've been able to strangle my aims, and I've been able to play with my mind."
So let's see if we can do that.
So let's say I'm going to move on to the second flip, and I'm going to move forward from the first, and I'm going to move forward, and I'm going to go through the second, after the Fowur.
I didn't miss the 34-kgliding slider.
A core-bucked ball is a perfect one, sure enough to stand in the middle at the moment.
The last two fightings followed the 23th Fukushima War (Koran Island) last day were the curse of counterattackment.
It was one of the most valuable things I've ever had.
When I was fighting in Koko-san on 7 days, I captured nine security points and four capturing points.
But only the Nagoya dome has allowed the past 7 wins in the last 2 games, and has suffered the loss of the seven in the last 23th of August.
From such a difficult enemy, Nagoya dome, 23 inning (in the process, counting) was taken in an atmosphere and didn't pass the game.
I'm looking forward to further detonation, but I'm not sure I'm able to get a firm hold on a soft ball, because it's a high level, and I think I still have time to hit it.
One hit to the right is a six-millimeter match and a three-millimeter match.
"The opening has begun, the opening has begun, the seven, and the six." "The six have already worked well as team top and fourth.
For the sake of victory, we will continue to carry on.

Join us to the 'Logby HC' medal.
"I want to meet the press on the Internet for 25 days, and "I want to get the medal for the goal" by conjuring "Faith of Tokyo, which has been postponed next year."
Retired by five-year Rio de Janeiro, 20 years old, and by the same five-year-old leader, Fuji Suki Kusuki, who has been taking the team off.
"The conductor, of course, has a great effect, but he's going ahead as a player who can fight with him."
The team started a championing camp from Tokyo to Tokyo from this day.
Investments accompanied by the camp have been held for 28 days since March, but the practice of contacting the new corona virus is not performed as a deterrent to prevent the infection.
The representative has been restored to the top of the entire World War series of 7 people since this season, but since the WS itself is inaccurate, Ishi HC has been strangled and negotiating against countries who will admit their country.
The Medical Corporation was infected in Nagasaki, where the first 40-year-old females in the Red Cross hospital were taken into the PPCR test.
It turned out that 40-year-old women in Nagoya have been infected with the new corona virus.
It's the first day in the province where medical personnel are working at the Red Cross Hospital.
The infection was confirmed by a woman who was a 40-year-old medical officer in Kauma.
We're the first to have infected 87 people in the province, and we're the first to do medical care.
According to the province, women have received three health institutions since the 13th day of coughing and grouse, and 17 days later.
We've been in the hospital for 23 days, 24 days, and we know that positive is positive.
It's a mild disorder, and there's no symptoms for four family members.
Women have been working until 16 days, and the two weeks before the outbreak have not been confirmed.
We're investigating the infection.
A woman's visit to the Red Cross hospital announced that she had been infected 24 days a night.
There's no place in the hospital where there's no dense contact, but there's a PCR test for every contact, and there's a woman closed down, and she's completely disinfected.
The Mayaucasino Corporal's authorities saw the situation in the casino facility... have been required to present a new type of corona virus malignant certificate for entry.
Some 40 casino establishments in Macao have been working 15 days after new coronary infection (COID-19) since February 5-19, and have resumed work on strict defense measures.
In the DICJ authorities (DICJ), the macaskacasino control system calls for the maximum protection of the employees and guests in the company, and has the distance between the table table and the table games.
It's also enhancing the disinfection of chips for gaming products.
Also, guests are required to offer masks, monitoring, and good health codes on their way to a place where they can enter and create symptoms such as no contact with new corona patients, no fever or cough.
After midnight, the offer of a new coronary nuclear test certificate (only within the valid time of the Mayo or Guangzhou facility) was issued.
The newly required probation of negative certificates will be a relief to the water treatment between Macao and the Ministry of Guangzhou from 6:15 a.m. to 6 a.m. (a condition of decontamination of 14 days of quarantine quarantine) and prevention.
On July 18, DICJ received a change in entry conditions from the 15th of July, where the director of the station, Adrino Ho, saw the situation of prevention in the casino facility.
DICJ has continued its strict patrol against the Kasino facility and has a periodic meeting with the management and accounting company, and has shown the right policy of preventive measures in the casino along the guidelines of the government's sanitation system.
The view of the casino facility has been accompanied by the director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and there was instruction on how to disinfect gauging chips and how to take safe distances between electronic casino devices.
Still, due to the upsurge of Inbaundo tourists, including invading restrictions, the cumulative casino sales of June 1-4% of the year have stayed in the 337.4 percent of the country's 337.4 percent since the same time.
Ale from hot springs next month, next month, the swirling festival, and so forth for medical workers.
The new corona virus triggers a hot spring where the regular water flooding has stopped each year, and it begins to twirl along with a message of support for health workers from August.
Putting a piece of paper written by fans and local residents across the country, they pack the water town with the light of Yale and deliver it to the visitors.
The festivities are held by the Flower Flowers Association at the event where the "Air Flower Flower" has been shown.
Every year, large numbers of animated fans from all over the country come to the start of the 20th anniversary.
For example, from the lanterns of July to the Fukushima Finance Day of July to the "East of October", they set the lights on the stairwell that follows the entire water-flowing skyrocket.
This year, they were forced to stop the festival for a new corona, but the association called out "I miss the summer of the water" from local and international fans.
I just wanted to help with the healing and recovery of the Colonial War, and I called it "Richard Campaign."
In the past, local waterlines, about 50 children in the lawn, have received a pictorial message, and have been asked by over 00 people throughout the country.
Message papers can be bought from the Society's home page, sent to the Society's Reliable Envelope, and sent to the Society, where they can take photos of the lights that are covered with dust.
"According to 350 boulders with a set of $6,000.
The blizzard's light will be scheduled to the end of the month.
Yamamoto Koshiro, the chairman of the festival since the first time, is encouraged by reading the message.
As a campaign, the flowering characters and the paintings of Asano River bridge were also provided.
"From the day on, I'll give you a pictorial clarity file to a special guest planner in the hot spring.
Coco-4 in Western armament is the source of the soul.
Western warrior's proud source of woodland has shown his soul's union and has won the second round of Sayonala this week.
The 24-day Rotte Rotley has shown that the 2-2-9-dollar battle has been a far-fetched turbulence of four people.
Headslining from the safety bank to the first base.
So here's the 6th match, the rate of hits by 2%, and the 3nd forest in the bottom sends a vanto to the death 2nd.
From this day on, Ozaki, who has returned to the forest and into exchange for five turns, broke the field's right ball, and became three-two victories.
Yashikisaki, who is a hero, told me that I had no choice but to take care of myself in Benji, and that my friends also believed in me back in Bunt.
Four of the three-year Drafts, 2nd Forest, 2nd Orchids, 2nd Orchids, 3th, 4th Nagasaki, 6rd years old.
Each has an experience with the amateurs and a sense of responsibility.
Nagasaki, who inherits the captain from the Yamashi River at 4 years of age, is the captain who pulls the team out of his mouth with words.
The director of Togashida's safety isn't a sign, but I thought he'd be able to say, "You can go on," and my friend was a wonderful vantage.
Now they're suffering from a rate of 25 to 5 minutes, but they're holding the team together with wisdom to win, even if they don't.
In response to the U.S. government's opposition group threat to Communists:
The D.C.A. has announced that on 24 days, the Chinese Community Security has launched a group of middle-centric work groups that are threatening the US from the Chinese Communist Party.
They integrate and priorityize Chinese responses from different departments in the Ministry.
We are working hard to protect the United States from organized activities that undermine its financial prosperity, security, and basic freedoms.
Uruf's Homeland Security Representatives spoke a statement highlighting that the toxic activities of China's Communist Party trade, cyber security, migrants, and intellectual property are at a critical level.”

SG's 25th Orchamp Cup, which has been fought in the turbulence of the SG, was played on the fifth day of the 25th and the third round of the Olympic Games.
The 9R is the best shot for Akane.
We're the first to get out of here.
The two major battles, the Yashikita-Taka-Taka-(35=33), and the three people of Nishi-Kaka-Kaka-Han-Han-Kan-Kan-Kan-3, have come out of the two-milliests since the great competition.
We've got two suits to win, and we've decided to win.
The following "R" has been the shape of Osaka Yashima-kun, who has been driven out of the country after taking the main course of the interior.
I've been in the SGF for about six and a half years since the 28th GP series of February.
Also, Tatsuya Fuji, who was the first to be in SG, has been a successful soldier.
I ran up to the best six of my life.
And 2R will run away and prevail!
This is the 99th round and the 2000th anniversary and the Auschamp cup champion.
Taka-saka-kun, who runs from two courses, is holding hands and holding hands to the second one.
The third SG challenge has been the first time.
As a result, on the final day of 26th, the members of the 2R championship will be at war with the 6th of the 6th of the 6th of the 6th of the 6th of the 6th of the 6th Fujiji Shima Tsuji Tsuji Tsuji Tsuji Tsuji Tsuji Tsuji-san.
To close the U.S.'s consulate in China, the U.S. Secretary's Communist Party Clergy Clergy Not Clinic: How do you do it?
China Media reported that the gates of the United States consulate in Shikoku were sealed for 25 days by the Chinese government.
Reports also show a man who is considered an official carrying supplies and leaving the building.
We're supposed to be shut down by the 27th.
The U.S. government has confirmed the Chinese consulate of Houston, South Texas, and the conflict in the United States has increased dramatically.
China's High School of Independence in 25 days passed a post on the news article of the National Communication, with the speech of the Director of the United States of Communist Party to criticize the ruling regime of the Communist Party, and incinerated as a new war between China and the United States.
This is the media web right now.
The statue of Nagai Nagai, one of the ten-year-old's ten-year-olds, appeared on the 23th day of his 23th year at Yamura Takashi, on the site of his birth.
There was a ban on the front yard of the Executive Community Center, where local and state officials celebrated the completion.
The benefit is that he's a new soldier in the fibres and he's a Westerner, a doctor.
After I was on the lecture at the Industrial Research and Education Organization at the Industrial Court, I opened the Moslem Hall in Edo and taught my studies, military and medical science.
After returning to Nagoya, I conducted a military course at Munich.
The copper statue focused on the benefit of the educational chief.
I stood by the earth's table and had a book in my hand, and I fashioned it as a lesson for graduate.
The image of the table is about three meters high and the student's eyeline for the benefit student.
The design was the wife of the benefit student, the descendant of Harako, and the local designer, Saeko-san (27).
After 50 years of business action committees have been funded by the Nagasaki Daiichi Daimon, who is the mother of the Chemical Council.
The country's '04s to about 2.8 million yen of pure goods'.
The company's cost is about 2 million yen (U.S.).
A lot of donation is used for maintaining statues.
The mayor of Oakawa said he kept his mind high, and he made a big contribution as an educational student, he said he would be proud of the old country's future children.
Embape, wounded by a vicious tack, left the hall behind with crutches.
Paris Sungelman, who dropped St. de France's 1-0 at the Coop de France on the current 24th of the year, won the 13th prize after two years.
The PSG has achieved two caps in the country.
The last half of Nathaniel's goal to descend in the finals of Nathaniel's finals was to finish, and after Rigg Ann's success, PSG has been faced with a situation in which he has to be concerned about the Olympics in August.
Kyrian Embape, who was the first to set up the same war, was in a position to replace the wounded with a vicious sliding tool from CB Royk Perlan.
A young French star knocked his face down in pain in a way that got his right ankle wrapped in the right ankles for half an hour.
During the play, the players of both teams have been susceptible to a turbulent and uptight.
Embape may have had his right leg cramps so that he could not continue playing.
I've been offered a red card for Pelan.
After the game, Embape, with his right foot fixed, left the stadium with crutches.
The PSG fights the chance of Lions with Christ de la Rigue at 4:10 p.m., Japan, but it is no doubt impossible to use embape in this game.
While we need to wait for the media report published from clubs, there may be a lack of the championships in Portugal.
The Colona disaster is near the city of Arts, and it's up to Hasard.
There is a museum where everyone likes to touch art for free.
Among the things we can do is from famous artists such as Claude Mone and Gustave Krimto, to many unnamed artists in the country.
The online museum HASARD (Azar) has been more focused on its availability and freshness since April 1919 and has been more focused on its new way of life by the Colona disaster.
I wanted to create a service that would help everyone enjoy art.
It's amazing to be surprised when you visit an ass is the beauty of the exhibition and the beauty of the image.
On 24 days today, we have 14 exhibitions of constant and projective exhibitions, not only with color, but also with super-developments that convey the sense of writing.
They don’t need membership registers or entry fees, not just the viewers, but the artists who want to make a personal display are marked by the cost.
It's an online show that attracts attention.
It's one of those things that moves the picture.
The "constitutionality of Claude Monet" has begun to move again, which makes digital additions so that clouds, flowers, and grasses work.
"I want people who are less interested in art to come in with a feeling that I'm in a painting."
I'm a little girl.
When I visited my family in the newly completed Yoshimi Mountain Museum, I was shocked by the power of the three huge paintings of Marc Shagarl.
From the next day, art classes have changed to a good time, and even after college has gone into flight, they have carried their feet to gallerys.
At the same time, many people felt that the museums were not close, that a large project was only held in the capital area, that they would have less opportunities to interact with art than to grow out of the country.
So we spent about two months working at an IT company, and we created a website that could appreciate art on the Internet.
The number of users reached 10,000 per month in the first ten months, and after the spread of new corona, it increased by about 30,000.
If anyone wants to see it in a free way, I'll be able to appreciate it.
Assar's aim was accepted by more people, even though he did not reveal the Calamity of Colona.
He emphasizes that he can enrich your imagination about the meaning of art awards.
"When your imagination abounds, you will be able to reach out to those who are in need."
I want you to be a better society.
China’s age of quality is over and the age of Japanese quality is a simple reason for its coming (modern business) - Yahoo!
It's a Pandemic, and it's a change of values.
There are many predictions and debates about the After Pandemic world.
In a business post on July 8, Japan, the work of “administration” has begun to disappear... its bitter reality, the world after the Colona 4th, could be a major revival of ‘Japan’ in Japan!
I don't know only the Japanese who are strong in Japan... but the incredible reality I saw in Asia.
Also, in the spirit of the article on June 26, "The Complete Burning Mind," which is published to those who have come to realize the end of life in Colona, the violence of June 10, is now becoming the main source of the "prayer".
And it seems to us that the two substances, the economic business, and the spirit, will become more visible as a combination of together, are a major flow of China from quality to quality in Japan.
For example, if a T-shirt or a giant shark is not good enough for bad reasons, the life of someone who buys it is annoying.
On the other hand, the recently discussed Chinese masks and artificial respiratory quality... is deadly for such and secure products.
I can't buy any of these products, even if it's cheap.
They're going to pay a lot of money, but they're going to be looking for a "Japanese quality" product.
Of course, this is not happening in Japan alone.
Western countries, with lack of masks and medical equipment and in difficult situations, have been able to re-importantly returned to China's high quality.
Safer than cheap.
Also, items such as automobiles and other items can be fatal (detected death).
The fact is, even if the countries that start in the cheap sale of "Woe to me," they will not finally be able to beat Japan, alone, and the world’s auto manufacturers will fall down on Toyota?
This Pandemic reminded me of the need for security and security in many other products.
Also, security is important not only for manufactured Japanese quality but also for services like 'Japanese quality'.
Sometimes the intermediate flow is just as good as toilet paper riots.
It also reminded me of the importance of self-employment in Japan.
It is very important that every country has its own priorities so that they can obtain necessary items, such as masks (medical equipment) and food, in their own country.
The Korean new corona infected for 115 days, with over 100 people in overseas, with 86 most of them.
South Korea's Central Reserve Control Center for 25 days has announced that the number of people infected with the current type of corona virus has increased by 131 per cent since 1:00 a.m.
More than 100 new infected people per day have been around 115 days since April 1.1.
In addition to the infection of 32 sailors in a Russian ship’s port in Busan Bay, 32 of the workers who returned from Iraq were expected to be tested positive on 24 days.
The number of new Koreans was between 30 and 60 except for 20 days (26).
Of the new ones announced on 25 days, 86 foreign aliens have been in the most infected country since January 20st.
The most populous country in Iraq were 36, 34 from Russia, five from Philippi, and three from the United States.
On the other hand, 27 people were infected in the city, 11 each in the city and in the city of Seoul, and five in Busan City.
Five of the people in Busan were workers of repairs aboard the Russian ship ship.
The dead have not changed since the previous day, and they have taken a count of 2.98.
The Nagoya Miyagi player is corona positive, soccer J, after reopening the leak, first Japanese newspaper Attez.
The new corona virus confirmed the 25-day DF's Mamiya Olympics positive against the new corona virus.
This is the first time the player's positive reaction has been reopened.
The club has been infected in June by FWNungos (3), a third of the team of both from Australia’s GKmistre Langueak (3).
They've already been treated, and they're back in the game.
The Miyagi champions of this season took on 22 days, in a big battle in Japan's Fukushima Dome.
The Nagoya press conference on 25 days online and revealed that 60 athletes and staff had taken the same day on PCR.
Reflexes by 98%.
Turns out he can increase his temperature by heat.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's a rainy season that last year has seen a lot of rainfall.
It's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's cool, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot... it's hot... it's hot... it's hot... it's hot... it's hot... it's hot... it's hot.
It's a global global warming issue, and how can we get through the hot summers a little more comfortable?
One way is to wear thin, white clothes.
You know, don't you ever have to wear a black suit that absorbs heat in the summer?
And they say that the same principle is used in the building of their houses.
Could the white be white, the lighter, and not be the painter of the quality that doesn't absorb heat? It was in the latest research field.
The Henry Samueli School and Applied Science at the University of California (UCLA) together with researchers at Columbia University's Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics departments, reported that they found the most efficient use of solar heat and found ways to combine white paint to increase the cooling effect inside the building.
So we're going to do a little experimental.
The highest reflexes of sunlight have been used with oxidizing oxides that increase to 85 percent.
The white paint that's already used for oxide has been placed on roofs in a hot-home building, and it can help to block solar heat and increase gas efficiency.
However, what was found new is the white paint from the polytetra fluoroethylene (PTFE) resin.
This tephron effect is made of white paint, which can be used to reflect sunlight to nearly 98% of the, making it possible to cut a large amount of heat.
In the heat of the summer, white paints with unexpected Tefron have made it easier for the house to stay away from the heat.
It's a time when we're going to be in the middle of the day, right?
The roof of a Japanese house seems like a lot of dark colors, but are we going to have whites in the mainstream?
The Amazon-Yast Seal, when will you be held this year?
The USAmon Dot Com has revealed the delay of the annual "Prime Day" serum, reported by the USCNBC on July 21.
Every year in July, it was reported that the year has been forced to postpone the development of the new corona virus.
▪ The spokesperson, the Amazon official, says in a statement:
"The Prime Day has been a special event for us to look forward to in the last five years to.
But it didn't reveal the specific day of the event.
But we decided to hold in India.
Presarily posted on the country's website.
He explained that on August 6 a.m. to run between 0 and 48 hours a.m.
The Prime Day has been conducted at the same time in the world, but this year may be a different step.
▪ The Amazon, a major event that sells 76 billion dollars in two days, began its large-scale service for its members in 2015 as a way to help sell the summer scene in which the sale was reduced.
The initial 24-hour event was expanded over the years, and last year, in 18 countries, such as the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, France, India, Japan, China, Australia, it took 48 hours between midnight and 15 hours.
According to the company, last year's sale of two days went up until the sale of the Black Fly Day (the first day of the Occupy Trade War) and cyberman Day (the following month).
The event has also contributed to the arrival of new members of the Finance Prime, and last year the first day was the highest number of applications in the history of the past and the next day was the next day.
And last year, they sold 175 million products in the world.
About this, Internet Ritler reported that the total amount of sale in the world for two days was 71.6 million (about $26 billion) per year, compared to 70 percent of the previous year.
Mobile number transfers, excessive withdrawal.
What about the fees and the points?
(New switching)
The Ministry of the Film Office has made a real effort to revisit the same numbering system (MNP) that uses the traditional numbering numbers to change the mobile phone company.
At a 21-day intellectual conference, he showed the policy of renovating the MNP's guidelines in 2004.
The specific question is: how many MNP fees are there, and how many different are withdrawing from those who wish to return.
In the midst of the expected reaction from news companies, there is a growing interest in promoting a healthy market competition.
The first time MNP was introduced in 06, with the darkness of every country's bicyclist transfer far away, the fee was $2,000 (U.S.), but now it is $3,000.
The three-millimeter security company's MNP fees are estimated to reach $19 billion a year.
On 21 days, the Ministry of Communications markets has listed the current situation surrounding MNP in a warring group (WG) for testing the competition rules that discusses the competition environment.
The time required for consumers to transfer to other telecommunications companies was also given by the board.
The major communications companies have received on the web, but since the access to the base system can be used, the time zone is mostly 9/20.
The WG document has been written as the direction of the next discussion, the norm for the last day.
