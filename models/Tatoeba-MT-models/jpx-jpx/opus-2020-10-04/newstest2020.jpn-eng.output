Abema video in Abema TV after midnight after a broadcast of the ground.
On this broadcast, Suzuki will show up and teach as a teacher who's been so hateful from the public while he's not aware of it.
In 2007, at 18 years of age, Suzuki made his model debut in Garre magazine.
Ever since I first appeared on television in 2011, I've been putting the roses up and flourishing with high-century talks and overreacts.
Such a bell tree won its first place in a weekly magazine called "Brazilty and Other Parts".
He also said that the whole world of entertainment has been elected second.
As a result, the bell tree makes it clear that its mother was shocked, and that her husband and her husband were in trouble at work.
How did you get to get the top of "I don't like women walking in class" and look back on the steps of the turret as a turret?
It's a story from one high-school performer’s background to overdoing the Suzuki, talking and resilience.
In addition to responsibly responsibly, the chasm tree is gradually escalating its extremes.
In the past, you'll be acting as a bodytatch when the Suzuki was in the great auditorium, but you'll be in an act of incompatibility with the studios.
And right after the ground-wave broadcast, we're going to deliver a complete copy of the complete class and the laughing study department.

It's dangerous to drive in the high heels!
A lot of mishap on young Pedals.
A violation of the road traffic law.
More and more of the mischievous reports of accidents, such as the pedal, are being taken by older drivers.
The number of chronological pedestrian accidents (2015), the highest number of accidents in the police department, has increased by 1080 in the last 1080 years of the age of 24 and 1032 over 75.
The mistake of stepping is never that many older people, but it is important for the younger generation to call attention as well.
Would you like to take the Oshare from your feet?
You want me to take security?
The data does not contain male ratios or causes, but unlike older people who are often considered to be debilitating, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is also a mistake due to the lack of concern about music and conversation in youth, such as errors and clothing.
Among other things, there are women who choose various shoes by the clothing of the hikers, paps, saddles, and so forth.
While some say it's hard to wear when they know it's not good to drive, many have never thought about it before, and are driving unhealthyly.
But driving in Heil and Sadal is repugnant to the traffic laws.
One is that you must control the steering wheel, the brakes and other operations, and you must not drive to harm people.
The other is that in the 71th Reserve Act, which the National Security Commission has decided to follow, drivers must follow what they have decided to do, the 71th Reserve of Security Act, for example, in the 12th law of the Penal Code of Independence, Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka, Hail, and other things to prevent the driving operations.
The same is true of the city's provinces as violations of driving for "carriages that could block driving" until it is not clearly identified by the Hehel.
So why is driving in the heels dangerous?
It's clear when you think about the basics of safe pedaling.
For safe pedals, first place your foot on the floor, then place your foot on the brake pedal, and when you step on the axelperal, you move right to the right.
It's important to keep it firmly fixed, regardless of how the car behaves.
However, it is difficult to hold the pedals on the pedal because the size of the heels is smaller and smaller in the heels and smaller and harder to adjust.
It's possible that this could lead to danger.
Also, most of the cars have flora carpets, but the material is easily tucked, and when the heels are pulled and the brakes are short, the heels are untucked, and the heels are taken off the beats that hit the heels, and the heels are not stuck in the back of the pedal.
For example, when he returns from the pedal, the heel is dragged behind the pedal and the Axelped is gone.

"Beautiful and ugly" is a single piece of paper?
The image of a snake hits the beautiful girls of your art (Magimex) Yahhoo!
Do you have a common sense of the mystery beauty and the shadow of the shadows?
Since the 1950s, we have sent out many works to the world, and we have drawn focus on the beautiful girls that our teacher has drawn, known as "Faganga".
If you look at it in your hand and you look at it, you can see the correlation between the beauty of your work and the love of fear.
Because there's shadows, is it charming?
(5) It's a beautiful little girl with a picture of her painting.
Even in the introduction to The Collection of Girls, there may be a "feeling out" that even though the word "fears, scandals, shock scenes and spreads of stories are extremely beautiful, beautiful faces have distorted and perverted the expressions of grudges.
There are many of them, many of them, many of which are called snakes, but the snakes are looked upon as creepy creatures, and there are different ways to take advantage of people who feel beautiful.
Some people like reptiles. Others don't like them.
So, the sentimentality of the viewer might be that beauty and the ugly thing are the snakes.
This creature is also known as a more powerful creature than ancient times, and the home where the white snake settles is thought to be better.
There are a series of "Big Girls" and "A Young Girl" in a pictorial painting designed for "The Serpent".
It's a woman with shadows.
I'm going to say, "I'm going to be cool, I'm going to say it's a cool-buy type."
In fact, it's the "substantial" feature of the weekly boy Sunday in 1969, which is the delegation of the painting, the beauty character of the painting, but the deep sleep of every hundred years to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, makes me think of a snake.

In recent years, the Iranian drone "Aborbe" used for the bombing has made a dramatic improvement in the analysis of the crashed American drones.
It's cheaper than it is, and it's about a thousand kilometers long.
It's hard to get caught by radar to fly low skyscrapers.
The largest oil plant in Saudi Arabia was bombed by ten military drones on September 14.
Right after that, the government's anti-government organization, Husi, published a statement about the incident.
"I'm sure it's behind the Fouishan political group that Iran will not allow Saudi Arabia to make its own own oil imports.
After the bombing, half of the country's oil production was stopped, and the price of oil went up 15 percent.
Some have said the oil shock will come back.
"Before the end of the next year's election, we want to avoid the military invasion of Iran will continue to carry on the drone bombing of Husi in the hiding world.

The reason why the superheroYouTuber has become a regular worker.
Ask the president of the company.
9/ 27 (Final) 8:47 deferred
Youtubeer, who is now the center of young people.
While it is not uncommon for companies to use ads for their products, one company has started a rare process called “youTuber.”
A stock-market mix (DmMiX) is the main business of the company's CRM.
What do you mean "to hire YouTube"?
I'm the director of the DMMIX, and I've listened to Kobayashi Kobayashi, who is actually representing the company staff first, which has been adopted by YouTube.
I'd like to support a young man who'd like to take YouTube.
- What's this about "Youtuller" anyway?
Tuber's job is now a longing for many young people.
There's also a growing number of young people going to work on the job run, and there's going to be more and more young people coming in.
I've always been taking advantage of young people who are chasing dreams of Bandman and laughterers and others.
In the same way, I'm going to hire a young person who's chasing a dream of becoming a YouTube player and I'm going to support him."
— why do you think YouTubers are the person who posts a video post on their own?
In fact, while many young people are eager to work on YouTube, most YouTube cannot make the money.
Not many Creators who are working on their own video production and posting videos or their families are unable to recognize the existence of YouTube.
In this process, we offer people environments for salaries and content production.
I think it's going to be a bit unstable at first, and I'm going to support the work with the support of the company.

On the 27th, they joined the protest in Montreal, eastern Canada.
Greta Tunbeli (6), a girl from Sweden who advocates global warming, stressed that she will continue to fight for a secure future in the protest in Montreal, eastern Canada.
The youth's protests on this day continued to Asian countries, including Europe and the United States, all over the world.
The massive protest that followed Gregory's call on him was a series of weeks on 20 days.

"We want South Korea to return to GSOMIA."
South Korea's deputy Secretary Napper of Japan said on 27 days that he wanted South Korea to rethink his decision to reconsider his decision on the day of his disappearance on the day of his birth in the U.S. Ambassador.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to rethink the GSOMIA rescheduling.
The GSOMIA is based on daylight, day-to-day rice, rice palms, and sharing missile launch information.
South Korea says that if the Japanese agreement is broken in August, it will break down the walls to protect military information in the sun.
Napper claims that without GSOMIA, the crisis cannot be handled effectively."
"There's time for the expiration of South Korea."
He also said that it was the first time in history in the history of the United States to see the collaboration of U.S. Americans who share the values of democracy and human rights.
The deterioration of the relationship this day will hurt the national interests of the United States.
I told him I'd take a positive role to fill the gap with the sun.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

In the old Fukushima region of Fuji City, with the help of an artist, Owada Shimura Shimura started a crowd funding online to publish a copy of the book inspired by legends in the province.
In April this year, Koda started working as a collaborator from Hokkaido with a group of fellow believers, calling him "I want to convey the compassion of those in Fukushima who have a deep faith" through the book.
This is to tell Fukushima's mind.
While Tatsuya works as an artist in modern arts for mathematics, he also works as a collaborator after his return calendar and as a collaborator.
We arrived in the city earlier this year, April, after we had joined in the migration of Nagoya and the bear tree.
Kamura-kun, the city with whom he has sent forth his honeymoon, aims for the creation of a book.
Kosaka-san, who lives in the city, says, "I'm surprised at the depth of compassion around me for the first time."
I've noticed that the legend of the city is in the face of the devil.
The story continues to repeat a prayerful woman to help her husband to help her, not to be surprised by the fact that the demon has lost her face and that she is not afraid of being surprised by the face of her mother.
I felt at the root of the piety and kindness of the Fukushima people.
To get a hint, Kosaka made an early interview with Yoshimori, the city of Yoshimori, and completed the story of a gentle man and a boy.
From June to June, the material of the book has been filled with a warm picture of water paintings.
The cover of the book will be produced with a piece of paper.
It's like reading to parents who have the opportunity to enjoy the touch of the paper.
The goal of the donation is $85,000 for 600 copyright publishing.
The deadline is on January 25th.
Katsuya-san, who grew up under his history of Buddhist culture, proud of all the country.
“I want to tell you something about the real kindness, the compassion, which has a lot to pass on to children through the book.”
One of the projects that Fukushima has identified and assisted with the 'important localization' projects in the province of Fukushima.
The Fukushima newspaper has been informed, and Fukushima Bank is collaborating with management support.
We can donate it from a crowd funding site called "Redy Forward".

I'm going to take you to the bak camera station in front of the station.
On the 28th day before the tax year of 8% to 0%, families of the family came rushing to Japan, such as household banking shops and superses in Osaka.
Some of the home centers, some of the stores that sell winter clothing for the purpose of buying them, and all the stores are working to sell them.
At the pre-circuit of the Bickham, Okataka Station, the project has developed a line that has extended its limits to 30 days.
The man in the city who came to the refrigeration store said that he could not be seen as much as two percent."
According to the store, the sale was about twice as high as the TV, laundry, fridge, and so forth.
"The demand is more than imagined, and more and more customers are looking for a high price."
The sale of a suit is a trade-off.
The coat has been sold in early September a month since the early part of the year, and the sale of the month has increased at '0% compared to the previous year.
The man who visited the store to buy suits for adult use ("9-9-7") is still the first, but I want to buy before the tax.
The tax is based on a tax system that has taxpayers and other taxpayers and other taxpayers so that the home centers and supermarkets can be strangled with daily goods and drinks.
At the home center's time high-end shop, a specially designed corner filled with large amounts of detergents and tish near the entrance.
The sale of daily wear increases six times the last month's ratio, and it cuts off many times a day.
The city's civil servant (63) who bought a kitchen paper for this occasion, said it would be easy to buy it.
The Tokyo Hapitown Southcoast is also set up in a camp full of detergents, toilet paper, and so on.
The city's men (35) said that they would never be able to afford their daily allowances because they would have little to do with their burdens if they were given the pointback of the Cashless Repair.

His happiness is still on Balsa.
After the "Tell" award, the German commander did not imagine anything so wonderful that I was very happy and proud of having this award.
He said, "What can I say about him?" and says, "What can I say about him?" and that his team's style of playing was extraordinary.
It also mentions the director of Potatino and Totetnam.
"He was incredible last year, and most of the time he didn't get a title, he didn't have to stay in the memory of people."
I'm sure it's like a three-0 bid of a team with Messi and Salias... we could have a little chance to get a chance to believe it, and we could all have been able to keep track of this game.

Is the release date of the MaacOS Catalina on October 4th?
The image above was posted on the site of Apple in Denmark (now fixed).
The image must have written from October 4 (loden 4.OKtober).
It's a very simple way to think about it.
By the way, it's the most important thing I'm going to try for MacOS Catalina personally.
This is a function that treats iPad as a subset of Mac.
So, we're going to have to write a function called Sidecar, and it's going to be a simpler function of Apple.
Some rumors of the next MacBook Pro with 16-inch display, but first we want to experience the next generation's MacOS.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Japan’s Japanese representative, who won six medals in the 25th World Championship (Sis Burzer), has joined the Chinese OP (the state of Super 1000), which opens in early September.
Here, in May and August, the next five-length race of Tokyo begins with a tournament of young boys's singles for the Middle War (December – September).
Since May, the Badminton five races have disappeared from the 4th High Championship (Super500 or more) when the world champions are at the end of the world championship.
The first half of the war will be the two men of Matsuya-san, who played the second champion during the 4th assembly, and the two of the Taiwan's Climate Climate.
Matsuya won the World Championship, Climate is the world championship of Indonesia OP(S1,000) and the highest point for "world ranking points" that will end the race.
Moma has other Japanpo (S750) controlled.
The convention from May has been held in Sudirman Cup (May), IndonesiaOP (July 16), Japanop (July) and World Championship four.
The number of other players is less than the number, but they have been scheduled to hold the burden on the body.
August will not be much tireder than in the wartime, only one tournament of world championships.
The results will be expected in a series of middle-century fights since September.
Ace from Taiwan, strong in war.
Look at Thailand's youth!
In the same way, the Cyclopedia won the championships of Indonesia Occupy and TyOP (S500) have already won 7 conventions.
He also fought the local S300, won the tournament.
At first, he's on the strong, and he's not in trouble in the war.
Even if the assembly continues, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it will make it easier for us to adjust our schedule for future conventions by gaining a high point in the first half of the war.
Until last year, Kyoto had an obsession with explosives, but his stability in the play has increased so much that it has continued.
One of the world's most powerful opponents is peaching.
Except for these two players, the results of Thailand's youth Ace Cantaph and India's cyber ponys B.
Three athletes of Anders Antonsen, who are fighting for the rest of the European Union.
Cantaph is not going to win at the top, but he has the strength to win to the top, to enter the Best 4 in the 2st assembly this year.
There are still rough sides, but 20 years old (18-year-old) who have been able to join top players in the race with Larry seems to have a huge potential to fly in the cross racing.
And Sai Plinys B, who stooped out in India to win a single player.
We need to take care of the Indian population since the middle war only after Samir Balama, Pranoi, H.S., and Sri Lanka Kydambi, who are delaying in injury.

The price prices didn't rise, even though the expected value was high last summer, saying, "There are about 4% drops".
It is a major factor that easy access to the optimum sky has been ahead of us and the development of the three major occupants continues.
It is hoped that the right competition for consumers will become a lucrative product.
I want every cell phone effort.

The optimum delay was due to the lack of access to communication networks as planned.
It's just a dress on your shoulders that was expected to be a detonation of a high-value competition.
I don't know. I don't know.
It's not clear when the service is starting or how it's going to start.
I want you to work with the company that owns the social infrastructure.
The change of the fee triggered the statement by the Director of the Senate.
"I think the competition's going to start with a new three-month fee."
I don't think it's a complete competition.
The company should develop the customer's degree of competition before it comes out of the government.
And we're going to do that in the next video.
Consumer authorities cautioned that there are cases where the burden of consumers is half as much as ads such as "the largest".
The company itself must be reminded of a reasonable explanation to avoid misunderstandings of its users.

It's been public at the meeting that night.
The hospital's total number was 29%, and there were a number of hospitals with relatively low beds.

The hospital that is expected to consider disbandment and transfer some clinics to other hospitals.
The cost of medical care increases sharply in 25 years, over 75 years of age.
For this reason, the Ministry of Investigation has launched a goal to reduce the number of beds in a hospital ('8) to '9,000.
Currently, there are many beds in high-speed nurses and healthcare costs, as well as high-speed beds, but there is a shortage of jobs for older people.
In order to cope with aging, we need to increase the number of beds, as well as the number of beds, to increase rehabilitation.
The re-construction and integratement of hospitals has been determined by the local healthcare plan that each city's province has defined the number of beds needed for 25 years.
While local residents and chiefs agree to separate the country into 39 areas, many of the local populations and chiefs remain modest, and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Investigation is trying to activate the debate by publicing a hospital name with less than a degree of accomplishment.

The Ministry of Agriculture, 9 Regional, recommended to pig cholera vaccine.
The Ministry of Agriculture published a revisit of a vaccination needle capable of vaccination with unfamiliar pigs in order to prevent the spread of cattleborne cholera on 27 days.
The area is determined to select nine provinces, such as pigs and wild saws, where the infections are confirmed.
The vaccination of infected living pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted in areas, but we accept the flow out of the meat and the compound.
Through public comments to the public, we would like to "In the early part of the month" to aim for a complete process.
The use of a vaccine and admitting foreign circulation, such as meat, may affect the export of pigs instead of the International Organization's "purification" and the import of pigs.
Since the birth of September, Japan has been holding a temporary position in a clean country.
The Ambassador of Agriculture has set up a vaccination zone in which experts view areas that are more likely to be infected with pigs from wildebeests.
The city's province has created a vaccination program that combines influenza ranges, times, rank, and progress, and is accepted by the Ministry and allows them to use it in an intelligence decision.
The other seven provinces listed as the recommended zones are boulders, mountains, stone rivers, Fukushima, Nagoya, Trinidad, and Tsuji.
And when the finger is revised, the region shall be revised.
The migration of pigs, sperms, fertilizations, dead bodies, and excrements is limited to areas.
As to meat and fertilizers, they are not subject to the cost of restriction or to the impact of farmers, and in fact, they are allowed to go outside the area.
To prevent the spread of the virus, we will complete the process of eating food.
They appeal to safety of pigs inflamed, and deal with prevention of circumstantial attacks.

During the past month, MF Fuji, who is now an unfriendly ex-Japanese representative of Japan, has left Melbourne Victory at Alig.
Mashita-san, were you actually in the game?
The truth of heaven will be revealed.
On the night of the 27 hours in Japan, he updated his tweet at midnight and took a public approach to a club that said, "I don't need money, but I have to play with a great team and a great teammate."
The person who sent "Reverse Opportunity" is a global gate, Manchester Uninided.
Why did Nata request a grand request to a strong ballistic club with a premiere?
This led to an article published on "FOX Sport" in Australia on 24 days.
In an article titled "FWs With the possibility of Manchester Uninited in the crisis of the injury" five unsuccessful players have been picked up now.
Among the players of Hatem Ben Alpha and Jezpe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, there was the name of Takata.
Today, UNINATide, MF Paul Pogba, DFluke Show, DFFEリック Bailly, FWantny Marchars, FWmarcas Lashford and others have been injured, and have suffered a crisis.
The red devil, led by Aurel Gunner Sulhar, has been forced to defeat 2-22 and have a hard run on the front line of Quarti.
So the Yamada media named it as a new candidate for teko entry.
In the article, we've analyzed that the contract as a creative side player is able to fill the holes of Andreas Pereyla's burying.
The nine most successful fights in Melbourne Victory are “secret records,” but the 33-year-old family needs to take part in his management of Cambodia’s national entertainment and attract complete attention.
So let's say I have a different approach.
It's also interesting that UNINADI will move for the Veterans that next year Tokyo’s Circumstance is the goal.
We've set up 500 portable translators, free-payment platforms, shops, etc.
A mobile translation machine that pays 500 squares, such as a shop in Yokohama.

Introductions to food, 236 restaurants, small shops, 3 in the camp, 7 in the other 34.
The whole city's territory is going to be 60%.
Map apps began to show where the loans to Google Maps were taken, so that smartphones could find the location of a foreign-lingual store.
On the other hand, we have access to Yokohama's tourist website.

You don't need a first shot to get up in the Pool House right now?
Mr. Cadi, the best shot on today's day.
The one-W shot is not always a cheering shot.
There's also a technique called "Ready Dra", which means you want to make a distance with the Per5 rounds.
The 1W recently has a higher head weight, with the risk of being scattered by balls, but there are also frequently players who practice it on the Tig rounds.
This is the first time the tour has won, the reunion of the island village.
Professional's 24th year is about 166 centimeters long and small but is currently 7th in the Duraviangdus region (an average of 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the precision of Fairwaywood.
I couldn't get a shot of 3W before spring, so I thought I'd do a relapse."
Sometimes, from the practice round, the ball is dropped on the top of the thy zone law, and it's quite easy to turn one-WW away.
In the case where Big Carey is required, it uses tight up, but both sides are used to utilize a straight Drake, such as a small hall.
You can use a hall where the eye lines fall.
According to the ballisticser, Carrie records 270yd to 280yd.
I don't have 3W, so I think I'm more comfortable with Kady than 3W.
Wood only has 1W in the bag from "Japanese Tourist" in June.
The second long club is UT of 17 degrees of rock.
The war strategy astonished by our tourers is also welcome to hear the leak from the gallery we saw.
You're saying it's going to roll the club horizontally.
I'm going to go to the right, and then I'm going to go to the right, and I'm going to go down by a down-blow and I'm not going to go straight.
The ball's not caught, and it's risky, but the left side can be erased (to the left).
I'm going to tell Kantan that it's a fantastic professional.
First ice floes in the circumference.
This is the first time I've ever been observed in a casino pond in Taipei, Japan, 27 days ago.

From July to October, Challenge 6 was held in 6 northeastern provinces.
The paralympic competition is still less known than the five-ring competition, but through Challenge 6 and through the same experience as the parasist, it is hoped that many of us will be able to understand.
The hall was filled with yellow costumes, and the laughter of the familiar Tarent Dandish Mountains came and experienced the competition with them.
On the 29th, Mr. Talent Magi will be arriving.
Until the 29th.

"Why do the big people laugh and threaten their children?"
Greta Thunbelli, a Swedish environmental activist who spoke on September 23, at the United Nations Climate for Climate, New York.
While the speech has been watching, there has been a insult to Mr. Greta.
Greta Tunvelli, why are the big people laughing and threatening children?"
Political critics apologized at U.S. television channels saying that they were mentally ill, that they were used for their parents and an international left wing.
In Japan, there are many online reports about what Greta said about Greta, such as "We should go to school" and not what Greta said.
During that time, Greta posted to his Twitter on September 26, "Why do the big crowd laugh at their teens and children and use time to threaten them?"
"I'll come up with as many lies and conspiracy as I can imagine."
As you know, people who hate me are very active.
They pointed out that because they don’t want to face the climate and environmental crisis, they seem to have a point on the subject.
Why do the great majority laugh at their teens and children and spend time threatening them, honest places, and I don't understand them?
I'm going to be able to do another thing at that time.
I think they feel that we're threatened.
But now you don't spend your time interested in them anymore.

In the opening of the 432-D television news conference, the editor and professional director of the food company on August 6th! We've discussed the "Calley of the Fascinating Independences"!
The show showed each of its own initiatives, the curry shops, the place to enjoy professional taste at home, and the story of the anti-retroviral rhetoric.
The committee also said that there was a simple, conceit and theme that was clearly seen at the end of the day, and so on, the Tempo was able to see it in a different light, like the glamour site.
On the other hand, I'm not sure if you'll be able to do that, but I'm sure you'll be able to do it.

It's been a long time since I've been working on it since I've been able to get a firm key at Fairway's small course.
I had a course where I had not had much experience, because I had a different front and backwards.

What's a way to prevent cognitive cancer and keep it to a minimum?
Reports/ Cross-Days
Large pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have been working on the research project and have broken down on cognitive diseases.
But it has been found that the relationship between cognitive diseases and living habits may be very mild and may be as low as forgetful.
I've heard of Professor Kawaguchi at the Kaji University Hospital.
I don't have cognitive symptoms.
- A prevention of cognitive disease or a cure is expected, but what is the situation?
It's the difference between major and minor, from major cases to severe, and that when you're older, you're likely to get cognitive.
But it is believed that it will take more than 20 years to develop new cognitive drugs.
The drugs that are commonly used in Japan are already out of insurance policy in some foreign countries and cannot be expected to be fully cured.
On the other hand, people have lived long while infections and accidents have decreased their deaths, and cancer and even death have been reduced by aggravated by promiscuous advances in the treatment of antibiotics.
And that's why there are more cognitive patients.
We need to build an environment that is safe and secure in the community as a whole, not as a person or as a family.
It's a way to keep things to the extent that things are forgotten.
I don't know if you're going to get cognitive.
It's possible that even if you're not able to get so much of a cognitive disorder, you're going to be able to keep as much as you possibly can and keep as much as you can.
Cognitive disorders are considered a form of life-time illness, and people tend to be more prone to it.
So we're going to start with a schizophrenia.
Cognition is one of life's ills.
It's a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol.
And that's what we're going to do.
In the United States, for example, there are areas where they distribute food tickets to poor communities.
It's very easy for people to use gas, to use electricity, to use it for people who live in a environment where they can't cook.
It's going to be less vegetables, less proteins, less fats and sugars.
And in time, poverty will become fertile, and what they do will be watching TV, and their bodies will be crippled.
