The great return of the Czech loser is approaching.
Pavel French was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old Pilsen native will be on the switch and could soon get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He switched to Vegas in the middle of the game and hasn't played in the NHL since.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"The Frenchman will be out for about three to four weeks with an injury to his lower body," the Denver-based team said in a statement.
His return to the NHL was eventually extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning U.S. time he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
He scored 94.5% in the AHL.
The breeder of Pilsen hockey wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last year he had problems with his hips and in the shortened pandemic year he did not catch a single match.
In the NHL "Francík" caught 36 matches, his success rate is 92.3%.
Charles puts on Camille's Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, using a photograph of his wife Camille wearing a cape.
This was reported on the BBC's website.
They send greetings to friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color, and Princess Charlotte is wearing a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, wears shorts and a shirt with a collar, just like Prince George and Louis.
William and Kate did not mention who took the photo, and it is not clear when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a Christmas card photo on a bundle of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country house in Norfolk County.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught them in June at the Ascot races.
Charles, wearing a cylinder on his head and a cape on his face, helps Camille put on her cape matched in color with a light dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case reportedly worked with the fact that the accused former deputy chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have been promised a million crowns from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
Efotbal.cz reported that it had access to some of the police files.
The chairman of the Vr<0xC5><0xA1>ovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the red and white people did not commit any corruption.
The server has published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia mainly features its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who was retired from the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential Red and White official was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second-league Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The criminals reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbra promised a financial reward for getting the title.
2019 SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) from the officials of SK Slavia Praha was promised a million-dollar bribe for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the investigators, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the Chairman of the Board of Directors Slavia Tvrdík.
From the file, according to the server, it is no longer clear whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdok refused any corruption negotiations.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, sought to influence arbitrators in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided anyone with any financial compensation in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Reporty.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some of Slavia’s former dark-skinned players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
In mid-October last year, a police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, unleashed a case of alleged influence of matches through referees.
The highest standing in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold war.
The cannons will be new, but in principle of a worse type (gunners must be out of the armored cabin and carry cartridges manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, they have already managed to get rid of the Prague V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
Air defense: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I've got a chase next to town.
Nutrients climbed from the river and caused damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to mess around, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped he'd leave before something came out, but of course the fox was gone.
I let her come at 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost took a shit, waved his headlights all the way, so I called him, "It was a fox."
By the time I got off the property, he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be a prusser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a combination of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in the thermovision that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, put expensive things to your feet in your sleeping bag, and you should be fine.
The Hamas versus the Hamas.
Home Respirators Are Significantly Cheaper Than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for buying and distributing masks, masks and respirators for the profession closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRadio server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in one day the amounts per respirator differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which governments have behaved economically?
Why did others buy the car?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with Dominika Kubi<0xC5><0xA1>tová, editor of iRadio.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of <0xC4><0x8C>SLA that older generations have lost), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory war.
We do not even have large stocks of equipment that the trained can take, we do not actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is becoming more and more complex, so the abilities of the midfielders will rapidly lose in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
Finally, hostages/territorial defense is of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is going to lead a mass guerrilla and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will be fought only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not even have the appropriate geography.
We don’t have individual skills.
That's not the worst part.
Worst of all, half of them play as if they have one.
Then there is such a situation that you watch as a dude, who 2 minutes ago did not hit an empty gate, runs into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself "tvle and what do you think will happen now?".
Of course, you will be treated like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this "defensive" skill is so terrible that I am caught that I am honestly surprised to see that our striker managed to outplay one player of the opponent.
The First Swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting any major turnaround for the coming weeks.
The stress in hospitals according to statistical models will continue for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the variant omicron, which is very likely spreading faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infection immunity obtained from a previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the Covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it will be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the results so far reports a success rate of as much as 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming medicines.
As has been said, the first to reach domestic patients is the Merck molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the tape first because the drug was developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for equine viral disease on the South American continent.
In this research, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not share their views openly.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to saying "how our beak has grown".
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will say no.
In the West, they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, to say this in public means job loss and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they'll find out what people really think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmour have more than 20 percent.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical because of the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to re-learn where everything is, so all objects are almost the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brda and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either because of the safety or the speed of deploying warheads due to the more western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the entire rockets as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up the warhead and mounted it on some carrier device.
Besides the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate Gypsy, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty cool, he was making good jokes, he was often overreacting, but he was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was missing a little, he went regularly, he played sports with us, he did not steal snacks or phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He also went to school in the countryside, did various monkeys, but he was cool, probably never in trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same class, another class.
Shortly thereafter, the teacher was beaten, the police often dealt with things there, they threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an ad (old things, something I do not need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they did not try to pull me on the price, communicate calmly.
I even sold the car like that, the guy called a month later, he'd already written it off.
I say myself that I am not a racist, I do not care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as he behaves as he should in a decent society (works, works, does not beat women, just ordinary behavior).
But when someone comes in, stretches out his hand, moves in apartments and houses, has nothing but mess around, makes trouble... so no matter what color it is, but I'll mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), they respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be there for them.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prahaticka
“The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot,” said Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian paramedics.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who drove the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of <0xC5><0xBD>íchovec to the village of Bavorov and, for reasons that have not yet been determined, he turned in the opposite direction.
After the collision with the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Octavia, a Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian police, <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Schwarzová, described the accident.
The young driver of Peugeot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he remained in the car.
After he was rescued, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and was transported to a <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice hospital in stable condition, said rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from outside the EU, customers often do not provide data about them
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects cards.
"Usually, it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars above, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive, he must now add VAT and submit data to the post office for customs clearance.
He receives an e-mail informing him that customs officials are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the consignment, and if the VAT has not been included by the trader already during the sale, it will be determined by the customs office from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier’s remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it’s usually a five-minute question, Neuheisl says.
However, not all shipments are delivered seamlessly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of shipments received from abroad at the international post office in Prague has fallen from 60,000 to 15,000.
Moreover, according to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to calls for data, which are necessary to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments in the international mail that we have to process.
If people filled in all the data they need and filled them in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Matyá<0xC5><0xA1> Vitík, spokesman of the Czech Post.
Solutions to inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation and it is expected to grow further.
What do you think the government should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
For example, we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
I was added 2% in gross this year, which is ridiculous, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run while working.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why convicted rapists are only sent to jail for six months?
This just doesn't bother me how the court can only put such an animal behind bars for six months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect their sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention the fact that the rape victim may never recover from it.
Wouldn't that deter potential future reports of rape victims?
The man from the tomb "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Grave inadvertently helped the officers to secure his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who had received an arrest warrant.
He called them to her himself.
But he did take a turn.
He first approached the passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
The officers arrived at the scene after being called to the emergency line and were not surprised when the alleged “robber” told them that he had invented everything to get the officers to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a report to the Czech Police.
When verifying the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a national search, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
Therefore, the case is handled by PCR.
Honest question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I am of the opinion that we are not ethnically or culturally Slavs for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, of course, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, the question is quite whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
Personally, I would not consider such a case a true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there is an estimate in the world, if I am not mistaken, of about ten thousand different religions.
What kind of god or gods should a man choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in any of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
The Ten Commandments say that there is no god but the Lord.
Would it not be more rational, then, to abstain from believing in any god than to risk picking the wrong one out of a thousand gods and the one true god I just missed sending me to hell or some other place for that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months on one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All the ACR files could use something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: the cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being frustrated, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of merger, when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only in adolescence, but this process is constantly happening, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar merger should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian raider will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is something carved into stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a problem.
Please the Lord.
Just one election in the US that cuts their budget and the whole NATO goes to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown once that it is enough to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence for a long time is an armed army and a population that can control the military equipment of its time.
And nowadays, every teenager can fly remotely, so what can't be done.
We don't need border fortifications, that sucks today, but a grumpy teenage boy behind a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unwrap gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home filled with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops that your used boxes will welcome has been created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as one-time waste.
Anyone can, by agreement, bring into the store involved (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150 of them) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently scarce on the market, as well as the money saved, as the packaging carton has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of eco-conscious customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One such store is also TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and fillers are transported to Pop<0xC5><0xAF>vka near Brno by individuals to whom they accumulate at home, but we are also contacted by companies with whom we have regular pick-ups of discarded cardboard.
We will use everything when packing packages from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we together create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauties of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopu<0xC5><0xA1>níková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted waste from the household, where to return expired medicines, tires, retired electricity, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All garbage can end up in the right place, and reusable items can find a second home.
In total, the map of the project contains more than 100,000 such places.
“Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, containers for textiles, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places are being added to it, which help to find use for things that would otherwise unnecessarily become waste,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Let’s Clean Up the Czech Republic.
Rather, I feel bad that today the technique is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo apps, or in fact mobile phones in general simply hide that underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but most importantly let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Before the weekend, Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for protecting Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they can’t make it in six months.
But French politicians like it and voters like it too.
Macron’s supporters of the right-left divide agree on little, but on Europe they do.
In France, there will be a new presidential election in April.
The election calendar has also influenced the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticize Macron for pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, it is trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French President, Éric Zemmour, is now touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let’s try to take Macron’s idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what’s happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they do not have an enlightened cantor, they will no longer know what the broader context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech “Mice” did not win.
The story, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also received awards for directing and for best actress Jasna Duri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>ová.
At this year’s Karlovy Vary festival, he held the first place in the audience rankings.
Best Actor in a Leading Role was Anthony Hopkins for The Father.
I'm not young, I'm not healthy and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" for a couple of days I had diarrhea and I didn't want to smoke...
It was worse than the normal flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone has it)

Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to spend it on living together.
The trains are starting to run according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
From Sunday, trains will start to run on the railways according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example, between <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Cologne, where RegioJet starts to run instead of the Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time, or slightly their route, will be adjusted.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The sale of tickets began in the autumn.
The Czech Railways plan to run an average of 6,783 passenger services per day in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
The trains will cover approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic routes, the new timetable will also include routes to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new timetable, will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be sent by the carrier to North Moravia or West Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
Tracks take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the timetable of RegioJet is the entry to the line R23 <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem – M<0xC4><0x9B>lník – Nymburk – Cologne.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 routes per day, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Brod, <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ár nad Sázavou and Cologne from Sunday.
Leo Express has retained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, as well as weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedla<0xC5><0x99>ík, the carrier tried to preserve the most similar driving times of its long-distance trains, despite the planned shuttle work.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be switched on some regional routes.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the <0xC4><0x8C>eskolipská region, where on the line from Mladá Boleslav via <0xC4><0x8C>eská Lípa to Rumburk will run instead of Czech Railways trains Trilex German company Die Landesbahn.
Passengers will also be able to use a single rail fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, they died.
I have never in my life heard a lesson from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one is defending this, only condemning it.
No one will even tell you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slave-owners.
No one in school will teach you that the colonists often bought land from the Indians, they will just tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I have not encountered anyone deliberately concealing the facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and in my opinion it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example, in Japan the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today’s perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in someone’s feelings, it is simply what it is, and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the things of that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do this again.
By the way, speaking of the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave-owners there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some good achievements, and I found it absurd to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better than many people idealize it nowadays.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was slave-owners, and a lot of things bothered them too.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, they lie and manipulate, besides, our view does not exist with them (there was also a video on YT TV where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in the US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that their country has never experienced.
All in all, it seemed to me that in some universities it was awful, those students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them in this.
And when I imagine that these people are going to be much older one day, it makes me a little bit sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that perhaps feminism has long ago achieved what it had and it is no longer about the same thing, it has radicalized itself.
Nowadays, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, which often leads to resistance even to quite reasonable things.
The more radical a person is, the more they are heard.
In any case, in the end, I have not encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I’ve had a lot of problems with geography, but it’s mutual. :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole unnecessary from the point of view of a personal identity.
If I have anything to do with people, I have interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but as far as I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak parish priest is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some bullshit about the coronavirus, that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact they were born out of Catholic modernity and are de facto Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to worship to the Hussites because it is theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
St. Michael's Church on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. they hold mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
B<0xC5><0x99>eclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-B<0xC5><0x99>eclav border crossing.
They took it to the border last year.
The light of Bethlehem is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we participate in every year with the section, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, scout Amalie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-B<0xC5><0x99>eclav crossing in the parking lot.
But Scouts usually take the train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes on the delivery of the flame in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scouts traditionally set out by train first to Brno, where they handed it over to the diocesan bishop Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18th, Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent light delivery, who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame in the Czech Republic and wherever the tracks do not lead.
This year, scouts must comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's going the same way as last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear masks, try to observe the intervals, there were as few as possible, not to sing to colleagues, just to behave in a way that was as safe as possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, a spokeswoman for the event of the Bethlehem Light.
The tradition of the light of Bethlehem, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread with the flame the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
For the faithful, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I do not have an economic education, so I do not know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education use the money properly, but I do not understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned, an unnecessary product is produced and it breaks down the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are a million xy-funded/co-financed xy-project signs in the hallways, and such a company is simply kept alive artificially.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs to people, this is the inhibition of development when this company somehow holds on and takes contracts / employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Totally agree, it's awful.
Sometimes a person who was born in the Internet age also falls into some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet advertising does not move with me, but then I still find that it has influenced me too - it is just so tricky that one can not always avoid it.
For this reason, too, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to completely ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all bullshit, in the words of the classics - I would ban those Internets.
I have a feeling that this source has roots in (but mainly in point 1):
"I will not believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I would rather believe something that is less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion about which I will argue that it is critical thinking"
“I don’t believe everything the media says.”
“I don’t trust politicians.”
TV has fallen in the trend of Christmas movies, this year the premiere of two hundred of them
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Movies, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen in the trend of Christmas movies, with more than two hundred premiering this year.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
In recent years, the genre of Christmas family and romantic films has scored and significantly increased audiences, which is why more and more of these films are made.
Four times more Christmas movies were made this year than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas in their title, so in reality there will be many more holiday films.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are especially associated with this period, for example, the films Alone at Home, Love of Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
But the real boom of Christmas pictures did not start until 2009, when a special film series came to the American cable television station Hallmark, the BBC server recalled.
Her advent project, Countdown to Christmas, featured four films at the time and was a huge success.
This year, the station began to tune its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas photos.
This year, Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its program, and popular streaming platforms like Netflix are contributing to the total.
“In this magical time, the story doesn’t matter so much, the important thing is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it’s snowing,” said Brandon Gray, author of I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
“For the audience, it’s a form of escape and a way to feel a little bit of peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the festive madness and madness of the world we’ve been living in for the last couple of years,” Gray said.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform, but successful.
You have two people falling in love, but then about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which, of course, will be resolved successfully, and the two will kiss.
It’s like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people are watching one after another.
Mazepin had positive text for COVID-19, he will not interfere in the final race of F1.
Only nineteen drivers will enter the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on COVID-19 and will not intervene in the last race of the season.
Haas will only send one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack the better position from the 20th place, which he finished in qualifying.
Russian Nikita Mazepin from Haas will not win the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for Covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, with Mazepin’s teammate Mick Schumacher taking the finish line, the first Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is relatively fine and shows no symptoms, according to Haas.
Nikita is physically fine because she was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all stakeholders,” the statement said.
He will not send a replacement driver to the Haas race, nor can he.
A possible substitute would have to qualify or ride in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not the first racer.
At the start of the season just ended had Covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year were tested positive by Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton.
You could go to jail for this, too.
And everybody's gonna give a shit about what the boss said.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in our home we never wore sweaters very much,” admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours over his work in six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24k gold thread in France and 2,000 decorative crystals supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness," praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there's one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I need to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," Lebanon admits.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago cost “only” 720,000 crowns.

You can argue that the money from these subsidies could be used better, but that’s a completely different discussion.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Gentlemen, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has formally requested assistance from NATO countries in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which is inviting citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise of easy crossing the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating in Poland.
Is the Omicron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Sanitation is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
“Currently, we have reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Primary School has not been proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the area this week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for influenza and non-flu viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,” the director said.
She added that they are two nurses from one workplace of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils of Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adamov.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four asymptomatic course.
No one with suspicions of Omicron traveled abroad
Neither of them travelled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor did they have any contact with anyone who was staying abroad.
There is no link to the water polo championship, Ciupek said.

California will restrict arms sales.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortions.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous state in the United States, using a legal mechanism that Texas has used in its controversial abortion law carried out after the heartbeat of an embryo was detected.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms in California.
Newsom’s announcement responded to Friday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which kept the Texas abortion ban in place, though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent ruling that established the right to abortion across the U.S. by around the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court now decided not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Enforcement of the prohibition in the present case has been brought to the attention of the public, making it impossible for the Texan Republicans to challenge it by the usual judicial procedure.
“I am outraged by yesterday’s (Friday) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed Texas to maintain a ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas’ maneuver to protect its law,” the governor said in a statement.
“If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use that power to protect human lives,” Newsom said.
He instructed his subordinates to work with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how they are called home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can serve to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand damages of at least $10,000 and court fees from anyone in California who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, Ghost Weapons components or kits for their manufacture.
“If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons out of our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that’s exactly what we should do,” he said.
California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the ban in June as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually renew the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who warned in a dissenting opinion on Friday’s majority verdict against extending the legal mechanism to other U.S. states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas’s abortion ban full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against selected officials in the southern state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where it is gradually coming up with what the vaccination scheme will look like, and also there is an improvement of the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
For example, from Israel, there is already a large-scale study on the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients have up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will eventually have its own vaccination scheme, but it is too early for that.
Another fact is that in a short time a new vaccine, based on the inactivated virus, will be released, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises up to 10 times more effectiveness.

I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don’t want to change the TV and Internet providers.
Poland threatens to cut payments to EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting against the law if it used the new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's plan to draw <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36 billion from an EU fund to rebuild economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use the mechanism to remove EU subsidies to countries that violate the rule of law.
“Poland should respond to this EU blackmail with a veto on all issues that require unanimity,” said Ziobro, the head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would have lost a narrow majority in the Sejm.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU’s energy and climate policy, which will lead to a drastic rise in energy prices,” Ziobro said.
If the dispute continues, I will ask Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified given that the EU is unlawfully withholding funds from the common budget, to which we are also contributing, the Polish minister added.
His party is more radical in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary undertook under Ziobro’s leadership threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is imposing “impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland”.
Warsaw faces “a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on a government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never make concessions to Brussels that would limit Poland’s sovereignty.
"We will never agree that Poland should have the status of a colony," he said.
But to know... there's one kind of cheese in four different places in Lidl.
I did not look at other things, I met one yogurt several times too, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk racks I resigned and asked.
They had it, it is true, in that narrow sector were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there is an avoidance, I don’t even smell at any market anymore, the action is no action, the gold store in the square, they may not have such a choice, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I’m done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years, I've been watching data being treated like manure, and most of those who oppose vaccinations are just a little more out of the box than most of those who support vaccinations.
Rational discussions are taking place at an expert level, but only extreme opinions are being brought into the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary reasoning: Vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.
Forbid everything, allow everything.
Color cakes instead of robust analyses.
Compare apples with pears.
This is what this state does, and this is how we do it.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in these two states no one solves.
Ugh, so I'm relieved.
I'm sorry for the outburst, and I wish you all a good day.
When I was a kid, I was punished with a spoon.
It was never because of the grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mom always threatened that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after the next "grabbing" she just brought the bucket and laid it down so that I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I received a few blows to the ass (through the clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable manner and to a degree) is beneficial, because the child responds to them much more than to words.
I think the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a choice in its own way whether to disobey and get, or improve and there is no punishment.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Defense of the system
When Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl, a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, answered a journalistic question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him – whether it was a sacred document that he swore to and learned about at school, or, on the contrary, an agreement that could be changed if necessary, he was definitely inclined to the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we as a state and its citizens are, and it is better to save them with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their own rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl then voted the question.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes is increasingly emerging among lawyers.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
On one point, however, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to coping with most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of government consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians to bans.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder for children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been struggling with especially recently.
“We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, we talk about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said Petr Dominik, the head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University.
The course is much easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
However, there are children who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the recent period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at the Children's Infectious Diseases Clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with post-covid syndromes were in the doctor's department continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute COVID pneumonia, that is, pneumonia that requires staying in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies alongside adults.
In hospitals, there are also children in serious condition due to the coronavirus.
“Currently, we have a child of several months and an adolescent age,” the chief said.
However, he is pleased that no deaths of children have been recorded at the FN Brno Children's Hospital due to the coronavirus.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in a children’s hospital – not only in the coronavirus ward – he is an integral part of the psychologist’s cooperation.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
“Therefore, we also recommend the use of the vaccine in children,” the doctor added.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk on marked roads.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the rest zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the enclosure).
Skiing/biking in the forest outside the marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not monitored so much outside the national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
The music is in my head, Josef Kurfi<0xC5><0x99>t laughs.
He was bred by the Liberian opera and originally played the horn.
As a singer, he can sing practically all the repertoire and as a conductor works not only at the F. <0xC5><0xA0>alda Theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, at the Josef Kajetan Tyl Theatre.
He cooperates with the Hradec Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra or the Podkrkono<0xC5><0xA1>e Symphony Orchestra.
China builds the impression of managed contagion and that the authoritarian regime faces the crisis better
Sinologist Jirou<0xC5><0xA1>: China is building the impression of managed contagion and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis.
China has embarked on a military and military offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing echoed criticism for failing to stop a disease that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero-increase infection.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus, for example, in Italy, which has been hit hardest.
How to perceive the willingness of Beijing?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says, "Hey, don't you want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's great.
The wife is happy because she saves the grass, she washes the car with a trunk, the children play with it.
Well, that's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Let's slap it, it'll be great...
After a while they meet and the one who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell it for an elephant????
The lawn is shattered, the car is all over the place, the kids are scared of it, and my wife wants to get a divorce.
The guy who sold it says, "You don't talk nicely about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that."
World affairs are dominated by superpowers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the superpowers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
It operates at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
I personally think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will succeed.
I thought of that too, and it’s quite possible.
I'm not an expert in English, so maybe I'm a vocabulary speaker.
I'm just starting from the fact that the ellipse usually involves 2 different units on the same level.
I will take an example from another commentary on 'Spanish oranges and mandarins', where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas in the case of 'Spanish fruit and mandarins' it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad term, and there is no need to specify it further for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just talking :D
Either way, it's a nonsensical request
A five-degree earthquake has been recorded in Tokyo.
Japan's capital Tokyo and surrounding areas were hit by a 5.0-magnitude earthquake on Sunday.
Witnesses said buildings trembled in the capital, but no damage has been reported so far.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured monkey hairy Milly
The terrifying footage shows the moment when the frightened monkey crouched in the toilet bowl before its ruthless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
Holland's monkey also fed sausages, kebabs, and burgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent City Court has now banned her from raising animals for life, The Sun reported.
Rehabilitation experts who have taken care of Milly after her abuse have said they have never seen such a frightened ape before.
Milly has spent nearly two years rehabilitating with Monkey World staff in Dorset and is now playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The four-time mother has pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks imprisonment with a suspended sentence of one year at the Gwent Magistrates Court.
Hollande was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was given a lifetime ban on animal husbandry and has to pay CZK 12,000 in court costs.
Team leader of the Small Monkeys, who rehabilitated the animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from anyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, adds Sawyer.
Milly’s mistreatment came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage of her wife’s phone after a raid on her apartment on drug charges.
You can hear Milly cursing vulgarly in the footage.
In the next video, Holland is heard offering cocaine to a monkey and saying, “Do you want cocaine?”
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell it.
In her house, cocaine worth <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 (less than CZK 50,000) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you're gonna take the same stuff in freshman year as you were in sixth grade?
And it's killing the idea of biffing, where no one, the honor of exceptions, cares if you can do it or understand it.
Just write a test on 1 and then no one cares.
Go out on the street and randomly ask people if you manage to determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equations and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the vast majority won't even squeeze in and tell you they're totally fucked.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I am a big fan of general overview and the reality is that people don’t want and don’t need it.
And at that point, it's useless, and you're never gonna get it in them anyway.
This is partly learning for the many people who will need this thing.
But, like, the remark that you don't really need all this to stand by the machine, I mean it completely seriously... because you just don't.
In addition, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a mark of punk.
(Which probably involves our communist past and the harassment of the educated and the elites) But the cost of barbarians costing us with these machines is simply high.
If journalists were able to count, Covid probably would never have reached this size.
Wedding at first sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can’t leave Switzerland right now,” Andrea said on Instagram in Stories, responding to curious fans’ questions, which disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
It had been between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move with her, at least until she returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack on your part! Kadri was furious in response to Andrea's accusations of lying, gambling, and debt.
Kadri's alleged sincerity no longer appealed to his ex-wife, not even his younger sister Linda.
He decided to publicly support his brother.
I don't normally comment on such things at all, and even in the family we never said too much of these things.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I love so much, it just won’t let me!
I’m sorry to have to do this in this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, even at a young age.
I am all the more sorry to have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would like to wish everyone to know Kadri as well as me, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrea’s words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know how it really was, she added indefinitely.
A drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao began his robbery in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he thought of nothing better than climbing up to the fifth floor and entering the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas.
He is then caught walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She then arrested Chao.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on the day of the crime.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob in a drunken state.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
A drunk man climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is time-limited and effective on a pandemic alert.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of business.
Isn't that reason enough for you?
The right to collect will be limited, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters came to the municipal elections on Saturday
On Saturday, people voted for the new councils in the municipalities of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a in the Uhersk<0xC3><0xBD> Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> region, Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice in the Mostek region, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in the Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imov region.
The number of deputies in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected deputies have disintegrated.
On Saturday, 99 candidates applied for a total of 28 seats.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday’s elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
In total, there were four new or repeated elections to municipal deputies and, above all, the highly monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said the Vice-President of the Czech Social Democratic Union, Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the choices were more demanding on equipment and personnel security.
In Komna, Hungary, the elections were won by the Association of Independent Candidates, which received 27.76 percent of the votes and two seats in the seven-member assembly.
Stan received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means winning two seats.
Two seats in the House of Representatives were also won by Citizens for the House of Commons, with 18.52% of voters casting their vote.
The former mayor of the municipality, Jana K<0xC5><0x99>i<0xC5><0xBE>ková, who is a member of the Private Families, was again elected for them.
One mandate in the council was achieved by the Komnians – independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the urns.
In the village of Rovná in Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imov region, the association Pro Rovná won.
It received 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 joined the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Lusatian and Svin<0xC4><0x8D>ice Association, led by Mayor Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich John, again won the repeated elections in Lusatia.

The municipality for the people, which gave 43.27% of the vote, will have three representatives in the council.
76.7% of the voters came to the urns.
The elections in Nová Ves in Liberec were won by independent candidates of Hope for Nová Ves before the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates, winning four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
The ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and against the regular elections in 2018, it was strengthened, gained more by a mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The results of the elections will be discussed by the National Election Commission on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to argue with.
If not, it is sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal after all to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars that it has caused, for example, the thirty-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell head down from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An unbelievable fall was survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, in which the rescuers of the Regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
Employees of the regional operations center received an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Immediately two ZZS crews – medical and medical – went to the place.
Arriving at the scene, the paramedics found that the 27-year-old man was about to fall from a window from a height of about 12 meters and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal caught in the Vitkovices.
But not as it should be, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation, and after other measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, an ambulance transported him to the further care of the traumatology center in Ostrava, said Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Humpl, spokesperson of ZZS MS krajina.
I am more concerned than the coronavirus about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are at the forefront of the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking military doctor David the Slicer.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala evening full of interesting results.
The UFC 269 was a tournament.
Outsider Julianna Pe<0xC5><0x88>ová was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who for seven years has not found a slayer.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight, he showed a great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Kai Kara-France also won, swiftly sweeping Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary “dwarf”, because Nunes did not lose for seven years and brushed her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her path to victory very actively and even gave the opponent a push kick, which she sent to the ground.
However, Penová did not allow herself to be forced to make any more mistakes, and she tried unsuccessfully to attack with a lever on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents enjoyed a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Pena put Nunes on the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up and stop the attack.
The American woman thus prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first Poirier was doing better, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on the hand.
That didn't work, but then he put a lot of pressure on himself, got his opponent on his back and covered him with a series of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier defied for a while, but then had to knock off the strangulation.
The Brazilian defended the title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley won the title with a hard right back for Raulian Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he was beaten by a series of precise shots and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to cope with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it is nothing complicated.
Most nouns in the Czech language express only one grammatical gender, so it is not difficult to determine whether they are male, female or medium.
Then there is also a relatively large group of nouns for which the genus is not stable.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genera.
When tilting, they then acquire double endings and in some cases remain in a non-tilting form.
For example, the words "tight" or "hip" are both male and female, in the former they bow down according to the pattern of "machine", in the latter they bow down according to the pattern of "song".
In the next group of nouns, different shapes are already in the first case of the singular, for example: "row/row", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "potato/potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example, "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is illiterate, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "trichter" and "prikopa", "dowry" and "dowry", etc.
Some of the words that penetrated into the Czech language from other languages were initially unwilling, but gradually adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is male and female, or the word "buffet", which remained uninclined in the middle gender, but in the male it has endings according to the pattern of "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation at the Greek border?
Tensions are mounting at the Turkish-Greek border due to the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to travel to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara ceased to hinder them.
European politicians are promising support for Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What is it that motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
What does the situation look like on the spot?
“We haven’t seen the blue sky in three months and we’re suffocating,” Sydney reporter says.
The devastating fires that Australia has been battling for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of acres of land.
How do the local authorities and the people themselves cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison’s government have done more to prevent drastic impacts, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are rare.
That’s why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to book it.
I don't know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how often these people are treated by their surroundings or even by the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Too many people keep it to themselves.
There will also be people who falsely accuse you.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a lot of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
The Czech Republic floods dismantled houses, families do not have money to complete
Construction materials prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people have been put in a difficult situation because of this.
It does not have the funds to complete the dismantled family homes and the banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of materials, the price of construction works also increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete the already built family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to dismantled and unschooled homes.
In the worst case, the built-up houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them, because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and even pay rent," says BHS economist <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
We build two or three family homes in a year, and 50% of them happen to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to comply with some things contractually, even if the material has increased.
So we work without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Slivo<0xC5><0x88>.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they figured that building a house would cost five million, now it's going to cost seven.
I think some will wait," Sliven added.
Copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive materials.
But construction companies are also struggling with a labor shortage.
There is a shortage of construction graduates in the Czech Republic, and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by pandemics.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favorable.
“Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
We're doing well and we'll be doing even better.
Real visions are missing, says commentator <0xC4><0x8C>RO – myRadio
In addition to traditional celebrations, the start of the new year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and Chairman of ANO Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and the Christmas message of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also spoke to the nation.
What have we learned of the essentials?
I have my own theme, I follow the bachelor's thesis, I always work on it all year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
The women of the state are completely at ease with us, if a man is not a total macaque and something remains in his head, then the commission will not stifle him needlessly on the theory.
For example, I studied for a week at the state office, and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to get me to some logical conclusion, which I immediately realized, and I had it right.
Otherwise, for those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we did it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they are taken care of.
I think it's great when there's an exam at the end of the course that reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't overwhelm e-mails and phone calls and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be a dick like them.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a statue of Putin next to Pooh Bear.
You might as well put it in a way that gets him to kick Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws sticks at artists.
Once you don’t give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to the absolute minimum.
In addition, it still changes which function is more important, whether to like, comment or save.
I've been really pissed off lately, so I may have to cut myself down to tiktok, where a lot of artists in my industry have been successful and they can't afford it.
In the end, I might even like to see something more user-friendly that doesn’t suck all the creativity and energy from artists.
Declaration of the Party of Workers in Donbas
The Union – yes, the breakup – no, the opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind occurred.
In the Bia<0xC5><0x82>owie<0xC5><0xBC>a Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevi<0xC4><0x8D>, without any legal powers and violating the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open leniency of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as an international entity".
With one stroke of the pen, they “abolished” a huge country of nearly three hundred million people.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Bia<0xC5><0x82>owie<0xC5><0xBC>a Forest destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately de-industrialised, inhibited agriculture, and detached from the world’s greatest power fourteen republics, which had previously been economically merged into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
There is such a thing in political science as a “force vacuum.”
All that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
To this day, the whole world is shaken by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a high turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it into Thursday's dinner.
In an alternative reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe the mechanism by which this meat will become a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or will I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK expensive and left it in my refrigerator for 3 days?
I’ll answer for myself – nothing.
These crap about when something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, rotten or poor quality are terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and the ladies were handing out a brochure in the underpass, I always take such things to help the brigadiers, they can not throw it out...
Well, the pamphlet was full of peasant reason and conservative views on how the world works, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I knew it was going to be some kind of agitation.
After reading it, I found out who published it and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless assumptions, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a cunt.
Too bad for the paper, because of this, the rainforests would not have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to please that person because you love him without realizing how much the situation is in the way.
Several times she threatened to hurt me for going out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she cried and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another half a year went by and she started beating her to death.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lying to her, but that we could talk about it next week to calm her down and keep her from getting soaked again.
Such a person will suck out feelings, emotions and overall joy from you.
Better to keep a distance
When insurance companies are furiously robbing here by buying a cloud of tests and chasing positives, who would not have known about this terrible disease had it not been for the test.
The only thing we are achieving is a complication for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator fell five days of house arrest.
In the West, they had already stopped the craziness and recognized that there was no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, War is new and he has to steal something else and fuel his ego by inventing buzzwords.
Looks like the good old bastard's back.
After several years of depression and suppression of this dishonest business, MLM recruiting is once again returning to the sun.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), the initial promises of training products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to care, especially get people".
I was sincerely interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare a person and chat.
When the first money came in, one quickly realized that if one wanted to make money, one had to swing a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only earnings, that is, one felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned not to jump on every speck and thoroughly check the information.
I wouldn’t put them all in the same bag.
People are successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they certainly will not boast of expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't seen much of that in the corporation I'm in.
HR is calm, managers are looking at their management and they don’t stick their noses in anything.
Regular evaluation is somehow happening, in the form in which it takes place in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what came out and what not) - it is more self-assessment than that someone would evaluate you according to some numbers, and the like.
Company events are also optional.
But we are also a little unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes one feels that we are such a near-startup that squats in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as the results are there.
A Czech woman missing in Britain has died.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police have been searching for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that a woman from Hungary had been found dead.
Unfortunately, British police confirmed this afternoon to our representative office in London that they have found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not provide further information on the case.
My sincere condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on a bus on her way from work on November 28th, when she had to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues five days later.
London police began searching for her and Interpol listed her as a missing person around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech Missing Persons database.
Police arrested a man a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspected, but she did not disclose it.
At the end of the year, four new municipalities were appointed.
On Saturday, 11 December, new representations were elected in Kom<0xC5><0x88>a, Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice, Nová Ves, and Rovná, Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imov.
The number of deputies in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected deputies have disintegrated.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates ran for 28 seats.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men received the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections in the four municipalities.
Thirty-six women and 63 men applied for 28 seats.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday’s elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils and, above all, very closely monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
At the same time, we had to mostly work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the voting will be discussed by the State Election Commission and after approval, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
It took me a while to deal with the fact that we have a rather dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without much trouble.
To deal with how idiotic a large part of the population is about it in all its layers, I have a problem with that so far.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not bullshit.
He would be deprived of the presidency and of the capacity to regain it.
The chances of this actually happening are, however, as others here mention very small.
Besides, I'm not sure that the fact that the file was scrapped could even be considered treason.
Treason is the act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the Pandemic Affected Intimate Life: Growing Number of People Under 35 Who Have No Sex All Year
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
These are mostly religious people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who give up their sex lives rose from eight percent to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they had not had sex in the last year are more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a study by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games could also contribute, making sex a lesser and lesser priority for young people.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported not having sex in the previous year has grown rapidly,” said Lyman Stone, a researcher at IFS.
Married people are more likely to engage in sexual activity, with only 5% of them saying they have had no sex in the past year.
Among single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contribute to the loss of sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under the age of 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, about 30% think it is a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
“It’s true that they’re a minority among singles in this age group, but their behavior is pushing this trend,” Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is a religious foundation.
Since 2008, for single people under the age of 35, who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has risen from 20 percent to almost 60 percent.
Among the “less religious” the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent, Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during pandemics.
The study also found that people without work or with lower incomes were less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seem to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replacing” this need.
This trend has mainly caught up with the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole of ordering COVID vaccines is about whether society should force a part of the population into behaviors that they don’t want, but that can save their lives.
This is a rather difficult question on which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether if we do not order them to do so and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn’t really know much, we didn’t explain it well, heard some misinformation, and as a result, he couldn’t get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are responsible for the death of a stubborn anti-vaccinationist who, alongside the SPD and the KS<0xC4><0x8C>, yells something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter signify the fight against drought?
This year’s winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snow pieces in recent times.
Operators of ski areas can not do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera Fifty.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will a little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I'd have a story, but it's not about a gentleman.
Once in high school, a teacher took us across the city to the shipyard so that we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there, we walked through a rather wide street, and we probably do not see one in the middle - the followers of the Hare K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a sect.
Of course, they came down on us.
Luckily, I escaped, but one of my friends and I got into a conversation.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul,” she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the chancellor, the crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the Normandy Group, which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked a migration crisis and used people as living targets and weapons, as we record a hundred attempts to (illegal) cross the border every night.
He negotiated further sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin can finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU’s eastern border.
Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukashenko regime.
Drunk Polish nun blames accident, tries to cover it up
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was already driven by another nun, who was trying to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driving license for not giving preference to driving and escaping from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle and asked for her help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
She was subjected to a breathing test and, after discovering that she had more than two ppm in her blood, she was immediately stripped of her driver’s license.
At the same time, she was told that she would confess to her actions in court.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Sajmovic did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen themselves in American stories about dog pets.
But they forgot the essential thing: the rules of the film trade.
After the kitsch film F. Brabce Gump - the dog who taught people to live, the audience emotions in the cinemas are now being watched by another film.
Co-writer and director Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> Jr. freely follows his previous film Here I Watch from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a penzion in <0xC5><0xA0>umava, which is dying, begin to invite the doggies, Julie's father and partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>ová (who is also the producer of the film) struggled with the narrative procedures already in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's summarize.
Julie, although a scientist, is subjected to the desire for the child in the procession, and if the right "constellation" comes, he copulates with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever he determines the coordinates - on the hood of the car or on the church tower (of course, during the ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired colonel Mojmír is able to copulate with him.
Nothing against the purifying treatment of nature and the power of pet animals.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at the contents of the pelmel full of unbelievable situations and figures needed for this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a dog-dog contest, a <0xC5><0xA0>umava charlatan, cops who come looking for "drugs" and discuss herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal - and who, of course, get drunk by a roasted family in a boarding house.
When the heroine wakes up from a severe coma and sits ondulated with a cigar at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and slacks as a cured vegetarian, she can't help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that “sometimes this happens after a coma”.
Sajmovich’s team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build supporting situations, a sense of character and point, and directing.
Acting performances are unbalanced, the cut is helpless and the overall impression is tangled.
No matter how Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Vaculík, Jitka Je<0xC5><0xBE>ková or Nela Boudová try to stand up to their party, they don’t have much to play.
The only positive of the film remains the poetic footage of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava nature by cameraman Vladimir Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch out a few characters, a messy plot and dog phrases, let alone the more vulgar expressions that the characters commit.
The argument is not old membership in the Club of dachshund breeders - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of man with the dog must also be the knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a credible story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family picture there is a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateur piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults exactly from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, and you can see how shitty you understand it, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn’t want to, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to that kind of shit all the time, maybe you'd change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a payroll brigade.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Meteorological Service said in a statement.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only 6% of the long-term rainfall average for November.
Two days of rain this week was an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas scenery, rejoiced the inhabitants of Nazareth Wasim Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is shocking and irregular.
Forests are dependent on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel’s largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring with its last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
Water managers have warned of droughts for a long time.
“We can expect that, depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall may decrease here,” Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for Israel’s Water Authority, said in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, tankers are increasing.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
“This year my orders increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years,” Imad Suleiman, a truck driver, said in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes have erupted between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The riverbed of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel Prepares Military Intervention Against Iran
Israel’s defense minister said the talks in Vienna had not brought “no progress” and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Secretary of State Benny Gantz said on Saturday he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for a possible military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reported.
Gantz, who resides in the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to increase their pressure on Iran, but he has also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna had brought “no progress” and the world powers “understand that the Iranians are playing with them.”
About 3 years ago this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a little bit and grilled during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
Eventually, I found that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, so I pushed the lady with doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked her and left.
You can tell me I'm a scoundrel, but the pyramid is the pyramid and the financial advisors are the financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains over the weekend, there was plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced this weekend the first major attack of skiers interested in skiing.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no snow emergency and some ski resorts have thus started operation.
The skier was also not discouraged by the obligation to prove himself at the lifts with a COVID certificate.
While lifters do not complain about customer disinterest, some ski equipment rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people took to the cross-country skiing tracks and ski slopes at the weekend in the Liberec Region.
The skiers wished the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out since Friday night skiing, when we had our first skiers on the hill," praised the director of the Je<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d Sports Complex, Jakub Hanu<0xC5><0xA1>.
Hundreds of people set off for the first weekend skiing in the new season also in Jeseníky.
For example, the Karlov Ski Arena or the centre in Branná in the <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk region were open.
Weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today there were an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare praise representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell the ski pass to people who are vaccinated or are within the time limit after suffering from COVID-19.
With exceptions, people are prepared for this and show the necessary documents, said René Hrones from the ski center Spindleruv Mlyn.
"We have only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some rental companies and shops of ski equipment.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Boki<0xC5><0xA1>ová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
Greater pressure is expected in the period of ski courses.
David <0xC5><0xA0>inták, CEO of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, also feels that due to the COVID-19, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowed.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, <0xC4><0x8C>TK <0xC5><0xA0>inták said.
People have become lazy with the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by the rental company in the Novako area in Bo<0xC5><0xBE>í Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must now order them in advance.
“We are starting to borrow runs this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect great interest, as last year,” said the operator of the complex, Pavlina Nováková.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic, according to her, is also about the ski school.
If we want the successful and wealthy not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life here as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and smart people go abroad who have no property here.
A business owner doesn’t go abroad.
With the rest, I totally agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one beautiful day, ruling for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is na<0xC3><0xAF>ve to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is elections.
If it's a bad life here, a traditional V4 madman can win it, too.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and the people whose property cannot be put on the plane will remain.
Terrifying photo!
Langmeier in blood for beer betting?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film The Island, led by Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Langmajer (55), enjoyed the tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a make-up for a shoot?
London police are still searching for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
“Petra’s disappearance is not at all like her behavior, and we are starting to be very worried about her,” Lucy O’Connor of the police department in Lambeth, where she worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and wants to know where she is," she continued.
She said the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, Ms. Deer worked as an "assistant nurse" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital Association.
“We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” a group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
“We would encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harmanová also called for public cooperation, who pointed out the case of Srnecova at a press conference on Saturday.
“She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried to death,” she said, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by London police.
“I feel that we all have a special responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, and working here for our health care,” Harman said.
Police have arrested a man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC news website, police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don’t underestimate Ukraine.
This is not a "huge amount", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of the Invasion and is starting to get tired of our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know how he came to believe that Russia wanted war.
War is a damn expensive joke, and Russia has Italy’s GDP.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is out of place at so many points that I don’t even know where to start.
I can compare this to the first Punic War and the annexation of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia annexed those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" on the border would correspond to.
What, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, they will mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers in Prague’s Integrated Transport (PID) are expecting several changes since Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mladá Boleslav is newly integrated into the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday stop express trains from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in the station Garden City.
In the suburban train service, S7 trains depart, passing from Beroun to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod at the Prague Central Station.
In the recently opened Prague-Zahradní M<0xC4><0x9B>sto station, the R17 express train from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov will now stop.
PID will be expanded to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Sv<0xC4><0x9B>tlá nad Sázavou, Blatná u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be included in the Mladá Boleslav region, including lines to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operational lines will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Zli<0xC4><0x8D>ín in Prague and go all the way to <0xC5><0xBD>atec.
A new direct connection Prague – Kralovice u Rakovníka has also been established, replacing the cancelled S53 train line.
In the morning rush hour and over the weekend, connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened, with the new express line number 404.
Newly included in the PID system are lines 400 and 410 going to the Liberec Region.
They leave from the metro station St<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>kov, not from the station Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Spinal line 400 runs through M<0xC4><0x9B>lník, Duba and <0xC4><0x8C>eská Lípa to Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 passes through M<0xC4><0x9B>lník and Duba to Doks, Mimona and Jablonné in Podje<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>dí.
On the contrary, the operation of a dozen Central Bohemian local lines, including those to Mochov, Dob<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xA1> or Ro<0xC5><0xBE>mitál pod T<0xC5><0x99>em<0xC5><0xA1>ínem, has been cancelled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and around Cologne.
Changes are also awaiting passengers at other locations.
Buses are replacing some of the cancelled railway lines or expanding the section on line 420 from Dob<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xA1> with a connection from Prague, where you can use PID tickets to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of central Bohemia and Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovick in the Pilsen Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option where to get food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, I do not have the strength to exercise after work, so I need to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I will buy pizza buns and yogurt and an apple for my snack.
Q: What is healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
These are not trees that you need to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If it breaks down, the tree may be more prone to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're not allowed off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Confessions Gifts about the relationship with Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d: I was not at all looking forward to this
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been living nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rollins and Pavel Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced for the singer.
Dara now sent fans an extensive message explaining why she had kept her love from them for six months.
“I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have escaped that Dara was caught by a bear, that is, Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d,” jokes Dara Rollins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But he said he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are accustomed to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both weren’t looking forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, continues the singer.
I just don't know who's worse.
Whether it's the ones who don't care at all and it pops up on them and out of the can, or us, whose lives they're chopping to pieces.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are good enough for each other, or if you insisted that everyone really knew in detail the list of your former partners and were familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's a bitch, you want it, it bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rollins traveled to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d has been vice president of Juventus football club for a long time.
They only went out with the truth now, because they were waiting for the end of Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they are not married on paper for only three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us that, thank you.
We are just people, we have families, we have children, we have a past, we have dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new husband, and just as he loves me, so I love him. For better or for worse, Rollins concluded.
Hi, the other commentators have probably already said all the essentials, I just confirm that the dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually met and became friends during the first semester or two and then found sub-leases together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you will live with.
The apartments are usually not advertised too long in advance, so you probably won’t find much right now, but it certainly won’t hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejla, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francuzská, etc., which is quite a bad address), and some parts of <0xC5><0xBD>idenice are a bit of a ghetto.
The Veve<0xC5><0x99>í quarter, on the other hand, is very student-like, the Královo pole (King’s Field) and it’s nice that way, besides it’s close to most BUT faculties (I don’t know exactly where you’re going).
I have never been looking for rent, but I am a native of Brno, so I can possibly advise Brno as such, if you still lack any information :)
This is an example of “normal” thinking.
Because of what a few doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it on their own or they go according to the state and the state pays for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor control a piece of education just because he will spend a few crowns on a full-fledged state contribution and thanks to that he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier expressed himself this way about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against having an abortion is the same vote for you as a vote against having a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced in cataloguing/digitalization that (even long-time professionals) it is either somehow out of sight, or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite legible, so I probably would not recommend it at all.
Personally, I would probably deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a regular and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and search for the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess the author or printer just created his own character that fits what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it more of an Odrysian Empire than an Odrysian Kingdom?
Pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our Presidency will be.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is smiling.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, however, some basic knowledge of English is not enough, that is the matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, while English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, for establishing above-standard relations.
In addition, the English language is quite interesting, after GB’s withdrawal from the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Ceyle.
I've been working there for three years and I'm fine.
How many times do I drive from work even at 10 p.m. and never have a problem.
That this is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly ever stepped foot there in his life.
Yeah, most of Brno's Roma population lives there, but all they do is block on the sidewalk and park where they don't :D It's definitely not that I would be afraid to climb the street in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good accessibility to the center, then I would go for it.
Lots of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slová<0xC4><0x8D>ek (78) without Dáda and Gelemová's mistress as a stake in a fence!
Who will she spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit their first candle at the Advent wreath, but Felix Slová<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw a wreath of dad, and Lucie certainly has one, said the saxophonist to Lightning, who so confirmed Patras's words that he often visited her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
He still doesn’t know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently we met with Annika, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slová<0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slová<0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so it didn't work out for Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts on a regular basis and I will definitely buy something for Dad and Lucia, probably a perfume.
“I’m a gentleman,” added Felix, who himself came to the Richman Club to christen a music video.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slová<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who was happy to meet Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila N<0xC3><0xBD>vltová.
And he made that clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is strategic enough that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
I don't see why that's a bad argument, can you explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in a crisis in hospitals.
There are few policemen and they can not afford it, as well as firefighters, and nowhere else is such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava is on the head of the previous governments, not the army, they have been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record-breaking drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has dwindled in mountainous and sub-mountain areas, and a smaller amount of precipitation is recorded in places where there has been no shortage of moisture.
The cause of drought that prevails in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the impacts are also exacerbated by the way we manage land.
What to prepare for in the context of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah it will be so, I can hardly keep in skates on the ice, I don't know what it is to play hockey and the tactics (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total mess.
And whether you are a hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Lama China", losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is equalized.
But anyway, what I listen to the Czech commentators who fuck, what the referees do not notice whether male or female hockey, it's all weird, but it's probably so with all the sport, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it was the other way around it is as usual, and that the Czech Republic has already lost with Russia more often than won, it would probably be the classic "outside lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people were hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The number of confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic in 1967 is 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
This is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest number of daily deaths since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the British Health Safety Authority, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to increase.
So far, no one has died from the omicron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after the infection and deaths about three weeks after the infection.
Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when lockdowns and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister defended that the quiz took place “virtually” through a computer.
However, it was attended by groups of employees in Downing Street, gathered around computers.
There is increasing pressure in Britain to remove Johnson from office.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial television ITV for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won by an overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the office of prime minister.
It's amazing how quickly things evolved.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in spring that could end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
These will be elections of European significance.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won’t be free either, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to profit from it, and does other smaller or larger tricks.
In practice, everyone can vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to bind voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating, they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Previously, the question was not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and if it would also have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by the united opposition.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they try to keep the power playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording by the Speaker of the Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, leaked to independent media, explaining to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my parents mom doesn’t have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then it explodes extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and angry as a child, to the point that I lay on the ground in a spasm and was all blue, they took me in the shower about 2 times to calm me down.
Sometimes I was applauded for my upbringing, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things with violence now, as a child I struggled quite a bit, now I hit myself to at least something for the discharge, and as a younger child I slapped my parents over my hand for example (so I didn’t get too much over my mouth), so never anything extreme, but I always have this urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent that's my explosiveness, but I'm sure the upbringing has a part in it.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose my patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn’t have done it, especially not at the moment when it was not “educational” anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws up something, it’s probably impossible not to spoil their children a little bit, so I don’t blame them.
I don’t care, I don’t understand why he should be ashamed of himself.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call those who make the laws in such a quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of a loss of income?
Is it really possible to count on people wanting and buying the product and you will have what to pay for the mortgage?
Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of journalist Kuciak’s murderers?
In Slovakia, the main trial in the trial of the four accused of the murders of Ján Kuciak and Martina Ku<0xC5><0xA1>nírová begins.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marián Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ner and his connection to the tops of Slovak politics and justice.
How big a turning point will the process be for Slovakia?
There's a lot of journalists to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition received more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical schools, which came out a day or two later?
No, they were foolish, and the company bounced back.
On Czech television, people were dying of COVID just six months ago.
The next government ends, and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the choice of repository nowhere
Minister Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s proposal needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is over, and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in selecting and authorizing a deep-sea repository of highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government has suspended the discussion of the proposal submitted to the Government after years of delay by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against the deep repository, but also with the Association of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The municipalities expect the law to significantly strengthen its capabilities in deciding on the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
In particular, the proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of the site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Repository Administration to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The submitted draft intention almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes municipal citizens practically mere statisticians in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks system compensation settings for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for the repository, its authorization and operation.
In reality, according to today’s legal norms, municipal representatives do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place for storage.
Only in certain permitting procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but it is the authority or the minister in whose interest the permit is to be issued that decides.
Any action shall not have suspensive effect on the performance of exploration or construction works.
The co-decision of self-governments required by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those where they have already advanced in the authorization of repositories, such as in Sweden or Finland.
Moreover, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by S<0xC3><0x9A>RAO and follows up on the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for these works is supposed to be almost 4 million crowns according to the register of contracts.
Antonín Sekni<0xC4><0x8D>ka, deputy mayor of Cejle from Hrádek and spokesperson of the Platform against deep storage, said: “After the Ministers of Industry, who pushed the position of local governments towards state authorities in the search for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Association of Cities and Municipalities for the support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental construction in the same way as the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Anti-Deep Storage Platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) to push for a change in the state’s approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of the site for possible storage be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman, 69, was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by the doctors.
They told him that if he did not lose weight, he would die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
His new character was featured in the Los Angeles premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body caused the furniture to crack.
“I put it all in my mouth,” the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
“I’m getting to an age where I can’t afford to sit still anymore,” Goodman told ABC.
It also depends on what kind of boss you want to use the word "boss" for.
If there is any text on the platform that awaits readers from the gaming environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it were for example a formal text and for example a university text, I would probably be looking for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are many types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, yes, and so the "boss" is something like a master / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be beaten at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player does not directly compete with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be called?
And then there are the mini-bosses.
It is not possible to translate boss in a flat-rate way, Czech and other languages do not solve it (interesting is only Catalan, which translates boss as the final opponent).
It is, in short, for a story or game generally significant, computer-controlled, an opponent stronger than all previous and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The world is searching for the missing Peter from London.
The Czech police were also involved.
Police have been searching for Petra Srncova since 3 December.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Hungary has been in search of her since 7 December.
Through Interpol, he also assists the British police.
Czech Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol has issued a so-called “Yellow Circular.”
The whole world is searching for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Rendlová said.
"We share information on the case," she added.
The reported search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, she is skinny and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Hungary’s Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> region.
Petra worked as a nurse in a London hospital.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Local MP Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Peter.
She was involved in hanging leaflets with Petra's face.
"We are very concerned about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
It’s unclear who he was and what he had to do with Peter.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month, as the year drew to a close, attacks increased significantly.
We saw a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers’ strategy remains the same.
An infected attachment in an e-mail is meant to draw the user’s attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment in the title had the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the repair receipt for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login information, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
Formbook spyware remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured campaigns with global reach.
Compared to October data, Formbook slightly weakened in November, but still is worth almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks were carried out continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt still appears.
Attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and dampening of activity is recorded by security analysts for the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of the attacks and has not had a major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
That smart-ass demo today who doesn't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The parade in Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the waterfront and in my experience of the demonstrator, I am not afraid of an estimated 10,000 people.
People in parade filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
This means that people really a lot.
To the parade of about four thousand demonstrators spontaneously added an unprecedented number of passers-by.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokr<0xC3><0xBD>.
That the constant dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led them to find a common language.
Only anti-vaxers, anti-scavengers and co-workers could not fill or pay for such a large parade.
The events of the association "Dead Dog" have an increasing popularity, it reminds me of a million moments for democracy in reverse.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and the same technique.
It’s hard to say which movement could be bribed by this dissatisfaction, depending not only on the money supply, but also on whether Pfizer’s three-dose vaccine becomes four or more doses.
It’s certainly not a left-wing or center-right movement, bet it is.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is obvious that we will have to have a revaccination every six months.
I’m glad the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant action of scientists, of which humanity is rightly proud.
The end of the stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing the change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has commissioned the formation of a new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections.
This has already succeeded in forming a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost elections under the strain of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties proclaiming the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The “secret” footage is a global hit.
In Britain, fears have been mounting over the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srnc was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her former employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived is also calling for information about a child hospital worker.
“Petra’s disappearance is not at all like her behavior, and we are starting to be very worried about her,” Lucy O’Connor of the police department in Lambeth, where she worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and wants to know where she is," she continued.
She said the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, Ms. Deer worked as an "assistant nurse" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital Association.
“We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” a group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
“We would encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Dvo<0xC5><0x99>áková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children’s rooms from <0xC5><0xA0>umperk (and also a regional pirate councillor), was told anonymously that her paintings violated copyright.
However, the court acknowledged that the paintings of the Mole in the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk rooms do not violate the law.
In <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem there is a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was a matter of life.
The municipality referred complaints to the <0xC5><0x98>SD, to which the road belongs, and because it allegedly did not respond, the hole went away.
Eventually, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the <0xC5><0x98>SD began “intensively addressing the situation”.
