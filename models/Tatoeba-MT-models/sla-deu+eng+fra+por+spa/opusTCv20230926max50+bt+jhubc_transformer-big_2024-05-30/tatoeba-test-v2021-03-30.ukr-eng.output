I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees it.
I got on the wrong bus.
I declined this offer.
Mary did what she had to do.
I was watching Tom.
Have you booked a table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
How about going on a picnic?
We couldn’t buy tickets to the concert until we got the money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.
He doesn’t play tennis very well.
I am a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
Tom needs you here.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People who live in the village cannot know the pleasure of life in the village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a coke and fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There is a problem with my account.
Tom gladly agreed.
I think Tom is wrong.
You all right?
You may be the only one who can do that.
Who is not right?
Your singing makes professional singers red with shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom's gloomy.
He was great.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
I got bitten by a dog last week.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to swim!
You are lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's dinner time.
It is unlikely that Tom will forget how to do it.
You drink?
Will Tom do it with you?
You're awake?
The meeting began at 5 a.m.
Mary says she likes to do it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I have only been to Tokyo once.
I got an electricity bill.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom would do that.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Don't you feel comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
With whom do you plan to do this?
We are satisfied with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He stood at the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
He'll find out.
A witness who has seen everything with his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard everything.
Guess who I am.
Tom returned to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom is finished.
When I entered the room, she was playing the piano.
You're very kind.
Where are your manners?
They did not lose hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When are you expecting to come?
Tom was ironing his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party was going?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn’t want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll have a bite.
I don't want any more.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
He opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
That's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
It's almost spring.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom is not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to invent a secret language.
Are you planning to stay long?
When are you planning to go to Japan?
My kids are at school.
I packed my suitcase.
I got out of the car.
He has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you would like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking about you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant bucket.
Pour salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn’t know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom is younger than you.
I am a French teacher.
Tom is very open.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
I don't blame anyone.
The plane took off at exactly nine o'clock.
Tom speaks French quite fluently.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it out myself.
Tom wiped dry with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I have a lot of time.
Allow yourself to be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She could not defend herself.
Tom leaves Boston next month.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Millions of people die of hunger each year.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
The letter had the wrong address.
This is the last train.
Who will fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all chocolate.
They moved to another religion.
I should be more careful.
I downloaded them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What is he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I just got my hair cut.
Mary said she had never studied French.
I am going to buy a new car.
It's our own fault.
You're so sweet.
It will cost about fifteen dollars.
I slammed the door.
His theory is worthy of attention.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
This is not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She is a tennis player.
That's how Tom became famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You were singing.
I did everything flawlessly.
I like to write.
Kyoto is a beautiful city.
I will be sixteen next month.
Do you think there's a chance it's gonna happen?
Come to terms with your dreams.
What time will your last lesson end?
I came to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing it.
We need to help Tom.
It rained all day.
I was upset about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You should stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do that?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines by day and the moon by night.
I got up on her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom can help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What is your rating?
I have a problem with my boss.
It's a banana.
Tom will probably be punished for what he did.
Is Mary your girlfriend?
London was in a fog.
I'm so glad you're here, Tom.
Tom is weak.
I told Tom to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you will win.
She went to the airport to see him.
Step aside.
He's in the kitchen.
Please don't be angry.
They won't tell us.
Work Slowly.
The capital of Brazil is Brasilia.

Listen to his honest opinion.
Aren't you on duty tonight?
Tom never had to learn much.
How's your wife, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has a lot of friends.
That would be unfair.
That's where you or Jane have to go.
If I were you, I would ignore it.
Tom's gonna be here right now.
These are the most expensive shoes I have ever seen.
It is a Greek name.
You think I'm kidding?
I was very tired today.
I'm telling the truth.

Tom pointed to the mountain.
The taxi arrived.
I heard him go down the stairs.
That's mine.
How strange!
Do you know how to read Cyrillic?
I know Tom very well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom's clean, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such a fucking asshole.
Tom gave you something for me?
I could never have done it without your help.
I always have coffee and toast for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I haven't had breakfast.
I'm the best.

Did you hear me?
The truth is, I lied.

Don't worry, she doesn't understand German.

We are comfortable in our new home.
There are only two infinite things in the world, the universe and human stupidity. I can't be sure about the first.
She said, "I'm very happy."
It’s interesting to talk to Tom.

I agree with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Do you have a bicycle?
Be brief.
Tom is smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You had a good time, right?
I was born in Osaka in 1997.
You have a beautiful voice.
It is important that you understand.
Tom wouldn't do that.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time on the Internet.

I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Do not throw stones.

You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're insane.
She has wine.
You're gonna stop.
She had been waiting for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.

Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My work is very boring.
He is, so to speak, a human robot.

I can't find the pull-ups.
It's a fake.

He has green eyes.
Yours was better.

Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, it was broadcasting the Grand Prix.

That's what I was trying to do.

Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new sleigh.

Did you finish your homework?
Monday will be a busy day.

Where's Dad?
Lock the door.
I'm not going to talk to Tom in French.

I was in jeans.
See you after the show.

Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm thrifty.
You don't mind?
I haven't seen you in ages.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are these?
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You want to kill me.
You see?
Tom walks the dogs twice a day.
Let me take a look at Tom's book.

Please don't be late.
I know Tom is drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I still teach French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot.
I wear boots.
You can count on me.
His book became an object of criticism.
It will be genius.
I'm very scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm under a fly.
You weren't wasting your time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom testified in Mary’s case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
May I ask what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You should quit smoking.
I think Tom is cheating.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Can you play the violin?
Can you pass me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.

Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't care.
She has good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom's coming to my party.
Tom told me he didn’t like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady’s man.
I'll take care of it.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a wizard?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Fuck off.
You're gonna let Tom move you?
You are a beautiful woman.
There is hope.

What do you want to talk about?

Sometimes I have trouble remembering.
Where's Mom?

It will work, you’ll see.
She dumped him.
Tom is safe.
I finally got my driver’s license.
I'm not a student.

How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom is not rich, but Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone was late except for me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don't plan on shaking the boat.
Money doesn't smell.

Eat something.
I'm with a client.

Were you at work?
What are you learning?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Good-bye.
Please write your name in pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She completely ignores me.

It will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How awful!
