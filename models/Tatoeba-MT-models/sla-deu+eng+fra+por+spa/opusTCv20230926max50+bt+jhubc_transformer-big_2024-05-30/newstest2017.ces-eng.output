Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in shop in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was this week on the steps of a local store.
But the victim’s brother says he has no idea who would want to hurt him, and adds, “He’s finally starting to do well.”
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia, the forensic physician's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation is underway.
Victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was previously a regular chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a close-knit family, and we will miss it so much," he said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and grief belong to Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first slept in hostels, but that recently "he finally started to thrive."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked food for us, he made dinner for us,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any arguments.
He was a brother who took things as they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was the undeveloped diamond that he illuminated every day," he said.

Czech Railways has invested over 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, the state carrier has invested over CZK 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernisation are gradually decreasing in individual years except for 2012.
Over the past six years, Czech Railways has invested over CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was reflected in a reduction in the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units, and by six years for classic wagons.
A larger share of the investment was made by the carrier in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money was directed, and the company invested 40 percent in the renewal of vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average age of locomotives and units currently reaches 19 years.
However, the upgraded older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernization of vehicles were not counted, the average age of <0xC4><0x8C>D’s propulsion vehicles would increase by ten years.
On average, passenger cars are slightly older, with an average age of 23 years when modernizations are taken into account.
If only the age from the date of production were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, in recent years, classic trains consisting of wagons and towed by a locomotive have been gradually disappearing from the Czech and global railways and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of locomotives decreased from 280 to 223 units, as did the number of conventional wagons from 2,716 in 2011 to 2,132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier mainly disposed of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
Among the investments that <0xC4><0x8C>D plans to make in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic high-speed line.
The contract envisages the purchase of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
The authorities have known about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We are helpless, he admits.
For a quarter of a year, the editors of the online newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz have been following the story of a billboard in South Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where not only a touristic walk in the crowns of trees, but also an Olympic park.
The highway stewards know they're out there, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of similar ads across the country.
According to officials, a weak law is to blame, which makes it impossible to immediately remove illegal mobile billboards.
First of all, a complicated bureaucratic wheel is needed.
In the meantime, however, the company will change its name and the office is short for it.
Or you just need to move the ad a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted a quarter of a year ago: on the main road from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice to Lipno, an advertising billboard is black on our land near the state road.
Even three months were not enough for officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
As if no one would mind that he was standing right next to the road, in a 50-metre-high protection zone, where nothing could stand for safety's sake.
Road managers say they simply can’t deal with the billboard because of the leaked law.
Maybe load it up and take it away.
"We can't afford to do that," said Road and Highway Directorate spokeswoman Nina Ledvin, referring to the complicated bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must legally precede.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which the online daily Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz began to follow in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and the authorities cannot solve efficiently and quickly.
In South Bohemia alone, the editorial office counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to or near the road.
There are other countries in the same way.
"We are having trouble forcing the companies to remove the scarves," confirms Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Klása, the head of the transport department of the <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice regional office, whose colleagues solve similar stories.
According to the Class, there is a leaking law that binds officials.
First of all, he has to intricately address the owner of the billboard to put the ad away.
But heads of companies are often unattainable or know the trick that Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz described in the past, when the issue began to interest in more detail: it is enough to move the mobile stand with advertising a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising in the trash.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and suddenly the coordinates do not agree, it is seen as a new device and we have to contact the owner again," explains Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Klása.
The new law will not help.
The change could be brought by a new law that will ban billboards on motorways from September next year and restrict them on I. class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as before.
The authorities will not be relieved.
Companies can continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on illegal leases, and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard luring to Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice City Hall is currently conducting three administrative proceedings with it for black-built billboards.
The company faces a $300,000 fine in each case.
These are several advertisements that were placed without permission in the protection zone of the I. class road.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice municipality.
Advertising, which is interested in Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, although not yet among these cases, but soon they will most likely add to them.
According to <0xC5><0x98>SD spokeswoman Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will get on the table of regional and then most likely magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that cannot be contacted.
It does not take over the post office and the official headquarters in <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC5><0xBE>kov was cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the post office of the company went to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who became famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representative office of the Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard leases space from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has in the past rejected any connection.
At the same time, this spring, when the <0xC5><0x98>SD began to be interested in advertising on Lipno at the initiative of Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, Fischer had state officials send a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his guesthouse, where the company is allegedly new headquarters.
To date, no one has contacted the highway administrators from this address.
A futile struggle.
Such silence or opaque changes of residence are not uncommon.
A few years ago, we gradually fined a company two million crowns.
She changed her name and name, and there was nothing to do.
The bailiff returned the case, the ads stood still, perhaps in other places.
We are quite helpless against such companies and their business practices.
It’s like fighting windmills, one official admits, on condition of anonymity.
No one is considering a new law in this regard.
At the same time, he spoke to a number of members who were interested in the issue.
So far, however, they have not developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for preserving billboards on the main Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for national, regional and municipal politics.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they themselves need them for advertising in the election campaigns.
I don’t have the impression that when things don’t work, laws need to be changed.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy, according to statistics.
According to estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the cereal harvest this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Yet this year’s harvest exceeds the average of the last five and ten years.
In contrast, the harvest of rape (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The cereal harvest this year will be 6.7% lower than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is according to an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of July 15.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and predicted a tenth decline from last year.
Last year’s cereal harvest was above average.
This year’s harvest exceeds the average of the last five and ten years.
This year, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy will be higher.
Rapeseed growers are harvesting 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they received 1.256 million tons under their roof.
This year’s poppy harvest could be 2.5 percent higher than last year.
The expected decrease in cereal production is due to both a decrease in hectare yield by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tons per hectare and a decrease in crop area.
Farmers planted 3% fewer fields this year.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is expected to be harvested by 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers have planted it in several fields.
However, the decline will be signed by a lower hectare yield, which will fall to 6.04 tons.
About a fifth decrease in statistics is assumed for spring barley, which is most often used for the production of beer.
The reduction in crop yields is due to a reduction in crop areas by 15.2 percent, but also to a lower hectare yield.
Winter barley, on the other hand, is born 6.3 percent more.
The rye harvest will also increase.
The rapeseed harvest is estimated at 1.305 million tonnes, up from last year.
Sowing areas increased by 7.3%.
However, the hectare yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s rapeseed harvest will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, while the area sown is a third larger than ten years ago.
Poppy fields have also been growing over the past four years.
This year, farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when the poppy was grown on a record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, the field is half.
Thanks to the extension of sowing areas, this year's poppy harvest will be richer.
It is up 2.5% from last year to 27,423 tonnes.
The hectare yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police charged two men with assault with a knife and machete, the court sent them into custody.
Police have charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in the centre of Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Despite the attacker's attempt to escape, they inflicted cuts and cuts on him, which required hospital treatment and further treatment," police spokeswoman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trbáková said in a statement.
Both suspects were arrested by police immediately after the attack.
The plaintiff filed a motion with the court for their detention and the court granted it on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers inflicted cuts and cuts on him, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people on Tuesday at noon on Freedom Street, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trbáková said.
A mass skirmish between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he was inflicted cuts and incisions, which required hospital treatment and further treatment, a police spokeswoman said.
The skirmish, which aroused a lot of attention in the city center and caused several police patrols and officers to intervene on the spot, was a family dispute.
Criminals accused a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc of attempting to cause serious harm to his health and rioting.
The plaintiff filed a motion with the court for their detention and the court granted it on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
The machete was also used in the center of Olomouc during a mass battle five years ago, when it happened just a few dozen meters away, in front of the disco Varna in Riegrova Street.
At the time, police said a group of about ten foreigners with guns attacked the guests of the business, who were standing at the entrance.
Police said they had knives, clubs and machetes in their hands.
The court then sentenced the two attacking foreigners to a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You might be surprised to see them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senová<0xC5><0xBE>né nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí.
It should have been a hotel by now.
But still nothing.
That it is necessary to build new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about using the existing ones, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several apartment buildings that, despite their location, size and often monumental protection, are empty and empty.
Properties in the center were selected with the help of the project Prazdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually the victims of their owners’ financial problems, opaque relationships between companies, or belong to a state that can’t or won’t get rid of them.
There are more homeless people in the UK than homeless people.

The Clintons earned $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to disclose his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her ex-husband, Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year.
More than $1 million was donated to Clinton’s charity.
Most of the Clintons' income - over $6 million - is behind their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, raising pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year, the Associated Press reported.
Most of the Clintons’ revenue – over $6 million – is for their speeches, mostly from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign ahead of the election.
The tax report showed that the Clintons had paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, followed by a state and local income tax of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
Trump has a similar problem, but has not yet decided to publish a tax return.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump does not pay any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after publishing her confession.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to secrecy over Trump’s earnings, in part to raise doubts about whether her rival is really as wealthy as she claims.
Trump’s fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican candidate’s reputation as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with the former first lady, has released a report on his tax levies over the past decade.
Together with his wife, Anne Holton, they donated 7.5% of their earnings to charity and paid 25.6% of their earnings in taxes last year.
Polio has re-erupted in Nigeria.
Boko Haram Islamists opposed vaccination and killed doctors.
Cases of polio have resurfaced in Nigeria.
In the northeast of the country, the government has declared emergency vaccinations because two children infected with the disease have become paralyzed.
The vaccines brought helicopters there.
Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram were operating in the affected area, defending vaccinations and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus went unnoticed.
In the northeast of Nigeria, emergency polio vaccines will begin because two children infected with the disease have become paralyzed there.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that 1 million children will be vaccinated in the state of Borno, and another 4 million in the surrounding states.
Nigeria's military helicopters on Friday swiftly delivered polio vaccines to the country's northeast, where Islamist militants from Boko Haram are operating.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating unnoticed in the area for many years.
In the past, Boko Haram extremists have defended vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks on Thursday also made it impossible for doctors to reach areas where children with polio were found.
The two toddlers were brought with them from a part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO polio eradication unit, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccinations in Nigeria will begin next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in the state of Borno.
The area was only opened to international organizations and the government at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram was significantly weakened in this part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole has admitted that new polio cases are a big disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio has been eradicated.
The WHO warned that it was possible that the disease, although it had not emerged in two years, was still spreading among children.
Children up to the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases in the world.
While polio was still present in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three areas: Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
Pope Francis meets with ex-prostitutes in Rome
He listened to the troubled stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who escaped from a pimping gang thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to trafficking in human beings and to call for intensifying the fight against it.
In Rome, Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who had been freed by police from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the troubled stories of the fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes he visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them were subjected to brutal physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
The visit was intended to draw attention to human trafficking and call for intensifying the fight against it, a spokesman for the pope said.
Francis often draws attention to the fate of people on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican in April and June this year thanks to his personal invitation.
France will attack jihadist factories.
Without the help of Muslims, this is not possible.
In France, Muslims are supposed to help in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is preparing major changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clergy.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer houses.
And others will follow, the interior minister announced.
There are more than 100 jihadist factories in the country.
“If Muslims do not help the state in its fight against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this freedom,” said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayer halls.
At the same time, it wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20% of the money for the construction of new mosques comes from abroad, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This is also why preachers who can sow radicalism in France get into the mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," he said.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The French Foundation for Islam was founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already then, the foundation was supposed to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon struck by internal contradictions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
After the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, there was already a debate on a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation in France.
All this was accelerated by other terrorist attacks in France carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently announced that a new foundation will be created in October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources, and also to supervise imams.
It is not yet clear where he will take the money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also various educational centers.
Several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal foods.
In practice, halal food vendors would pay for the certification.
Some of that money would go to the foundation.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 people go there for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the Prime Minister, in the future, only preachers who have undergone special educational programs at French universities should work in mosques.
This should ensure that preaching is consistent with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is on the march against the radicals.
And others will follow, the interior minister recently announced.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred in mosques and who do not respect certain principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, about 80 imams have been expelled by the authorities, and several other dozen are being considered.
However, not everyone thinks that the government’s actions can significantly intervene against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are becoming radicalized on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Dráha<0xC5><0x99> Kelemen lost in the 1st round of the sprint with the star Baugé.
The Czech cyclist has to fight for the eighth final in repair rides.
The cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, after progressing from the qualification of the sprint among the best eighteen lost in the first round a duel with the French giant Grégory Bauge, the defender of the silver from the last games in London.
He has to fight for the eighth-finals in repair rides.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track stood 27 riders and the best Czech track rider of the moment attributed the fourteenth best time.
He was able to take off in 9.969 seconds.
In the main elimination stage, he was the fifth Baugé in qualifying, who already has a bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
Kelemen, in the end, was annoying an experienced Frenchman, but he kept an eye on the procedure.
Jason Kenny, the gold defender, had a great performance.
The 28-year-old British driver finished third-fastest in history and won the qualifying round with an Olympic record of 9,551.
As expected, he was also able to deal with the last forward, Maximilian Levy, a German.
The British quartet with Bradley Wiggins also managed to break a new world record of 3:50,570 in the 4 km race and advance to the final.
The British record (3:51,659), which had been four years since the London Olympics, was improved by more than a second.
Young doctors are pushing: They want fresh wind in the field
Representatives of young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The Young Physicians Council (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the entire council to support further industry actions in early September.
JDC says ministers have not been able to resolve the issue of the treaty.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted against the contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the elections.
In a letter to members posted Thursday night on Twitter, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government remained “still silent” on the issues, leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the executive branch of the JDC decided by a vote to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to request new formal negotiations on all issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, today the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA to approve the ongoing program of heated industry events in early September.
The dispute led young doctors to declare six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in NHS history.
The leader of the young doctors in the BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which the BMA recommended.
He told BMA members at pre-voting meetings in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would be a burden for medical professionals in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of the “incompatible”?
It was a gesture that ended in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and formally end an eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the luxurious hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin was not smiling, and there was hardly any warmth in him, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his “dear friend” Mr. Putin – five times, according to one report.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their pre-crisis level, but will be even better.
The next day, a local newspaper reported that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the downing of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction was furious.
Putin struck around him and accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The scandal was all the more so because it came from an alleged friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to rebuild true trust.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
For months, state-controlled media have been conducting a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed like the Turks were responsible for everything.
More serious were the accusations from top state officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message came that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin was given an apology he had asked for from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost deposed in a failed coup last month and therefore needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey visibly shocked him as well.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s sanctions have had a severe impact, notably the cancellation of charter flights that carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies are sure to take a break when flights resume.
They earn on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television has promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the Vedemosti newspaper.
The visit, however, had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the coup attempt.
Moreover, the long-standing hostility of the protracted EU accession talks and Putin’s entry – who is eager to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly gained bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, this is a given.
So the summit in this pompous seaside palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to demonstrate what one analyst described to me as an “alliance of incompatibility”: how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West unite.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight those differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries could find a common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostilities -- and given the risk of total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet -- it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand is to be suppressed as a back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
It eased when it almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from its debt.
At the time, strategist brands used “RBS” to protect other brands of consumer finance.
It cost millions of pounds to sponsor international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new deals.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already used.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that get more in the foreground - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our visits to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan’s questions.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand for which our employees work, because we are now becoming much more a brand bank.”
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has also become a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, has prepared a profile of individual brands of sponsorship of the sport.
“The time has come for us to move to a brand bank, because the fundamental question (which we are asking) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?” the CEO said.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we were going to become a great bank for customers and introduce those brands.
But along with the way we've focused on customer needs rather than our own, I think there's a lot of change going on.
We can remind these brands again, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori at Newmarket Riding Predilection leads 3,000th winner to the finish line
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win at Newmarket brought him 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone with his second victory of the evening on his local track - the Predilection horse, which is coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in straight races.
Its predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion Dettori, who had previously won the Ghayyar, said, "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is here too
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because that is where I anchored myself 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predilection after victory
Two jockeys reached this milestone in the obstacle races - jockey champion Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who led more than 4,300 winners to the finish line during his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he reached a milestone that only a few riders had reached before him.
It’s stylish and powerful, but it’s its tactical stud that sets it apart from other riders in weight.
He is a fantastic ambassador of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if he hadn’t driven only on weekends and big races, he’d already have 6,000 winners!
However, the truth is that Frankie has been riding a winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
It has a lively character, which is good for British racing, but more importantly, it is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous jump
From snap finishes to snap jumps, Frankie Dettori has been the messenger of British flat racing for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
He also survived an airplane crash and was banned from taking off because of drugs, including his famous "magnificent seven" in Ascot.
He stagnated for the first time three years ago when he returned after a six-month ban, but showed incredible inner strength and returned in the best shape despite all the doubters.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing at least until he is 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired the head of the presidential office, Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest associates for many years.
The 63-year-old Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transportation.
A Kremlin statement said Putin had “released Ivanov from his service as head of the Russian presidential office,” but gave no reason.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old was formerly a diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later made the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When Putin was appointed, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of draft laws and to check the extent to which your instructions are being followed.
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be relieved of his post and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Convinced by smiles?
This step completely mystified Moscow.
For a long time, Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin’s closest associates and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on state television, the two men said they were leaving the post of head of the presidential office at their own request.
But only a few people were convinced by the camera smiles - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once considered a possible president suddenly wanted to lead Russia’s environmental policy was met with great mistrust.
The Kremlin website quotes comments addressed to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very demanding post, one could even say problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I was head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took over the post in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and has previously worked for the State Security Committee (KGB), like Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov as one of his five closest associates.
At one time, there was even speculation that Ivanov could become Putin’s successor after his second term in office because a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But another close Putin associate, Dmitry Medvedev, took over the post.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of Criminal Thoughts, released after hitting director
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange on stage in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his dismissal.
There were creative differences on the stage and disagreements.
I am sorry that this has happened," he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS, the details of how Gibson’s character will disappear from the series, which follows the stories of a team of FBI agents, are a little later.
The 54-year-old actor, who became famous for starring in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has appeared in the series since the first series in 2005.
“I love the thoughts of a criminal and have put my heart and soul into them for the past 12 years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but that's not gonna be possible now.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The series returns to series 12 on September 28.
In Banff, fish mysteriously landed in the garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish may be sand eels left there by a waterstorm.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short video of his findings on the Periscope Channel, believing that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
The engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct – the bridge now connects to Fife.
This is the first of four closures among the “platform mowers”, which are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 suspension ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment in Queensferry Crossing’s construction.
On this project, we are all witnessing how, on an impressive scale, civil engineers have used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
With more than 79% of the total bridge area now in place, concrete for the last parts of the platform is now being cast in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be picked up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closure of each bridge is always an important milestone.
In this amazing project, this shutter represents the pinnacle of civil engineering.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approaching viaduct 700 millimeters southwards.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled with an ascent of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team worked with were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Thankfully everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
The three men are "lucky to be alive" after being flushed off their fishing boat at Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station sounded the alarm on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw the incident at Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety as their boat continued unsteady.
"We saw their boat circling near them, and we thought of the worst," Moelfre rescue boat commander Vince Jones said.
"Fortunately, a strong wind drove him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while a third man, aged 60, was found without a life jacket, exhausted as he clings to a buoy.
They were all handed aboard a coastal lifeboat and transported back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely uninjured.
The ship's engine had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when it overturned.
Someone above those boys was holding a protective hand.
The judge refuses to deal with the case because of Smurf's wife.
Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> is one of three MPs who, according to the indictment, were to receive a political ticket from Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and his then head of cabinet Jana Nagyová, i.e. a lucrative post for political concession.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
<0xC5><0xA0>najdr, Fuksa and Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> made it possible with their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state-owned firms.
They also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, it was unjustified, and almost 2 million crowns in total were compensated.
The fat man now acts as a witness in the case, after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in the court building at the Fruit Market and settles civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious and avoid possible objections.
The case will likely be handled by another Prague court district.
The Queen has already acquitted Jana Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asová, formerly Nagy, twice.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to track the first wife of Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as Radka.
There was no figure in this case.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessarily excessive reaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in such a way as to exclude the court if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge then, he remarked to the diary.
"I think it's out of the question," he added.
Roman Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ek, a former clerk, is also charged with political trafficking.
According to his lawyer Peter Toman, however, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
On June 13, the District Court for Prague 1 heard the indictment of former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as Jana Nagyová (now Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asova) and other accused in the case of misuse of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, she and her husband go to court.
She had to deal with the accusations about Peroutko.
For example, the wife of the envoy was supposed to judge the statements of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said he sympathised with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl was apparently killed in an Allied airstrike.
She flew to Syria with two of her old girlfriends last February from London’s Gatwick Airport.
The British Ministry of the Interior did not comment on her death.
The young women who fled their homes were secretly transported to Syria via the Turkish border, police said.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana are reportedly heading for another former classmate from the Bethnal Green Academy in London.
Last year’s case sparked a huge wave of attention, as well as tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security officials estimate that about 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria so far, including about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them have joined radicals from ISIS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a hundred thousand dollars.
A very well-paid job for which you don’t even need a college degree.
That's what an IT guy looks like at first glance.
And often to the other.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary for Czech ratios (in Prague you earn up to 180,000 CZK by working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
This is due to a huge shortage of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
It is estimated that almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
Among the most sought-after are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, it is not the candidates who are competing for the job position, but the job positions for the candidates, comments Jitka Sou<0xC4><0x8D>ková, marketing manager of Grafton Recruitment.
College is not necessary.
Higher education is not a necessity for IT students.
Higher education means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of a candidate’s intelligence and education, but it often does not have much to do with knowledge of development.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which once graduated college will not replace, says Petr Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most money is made in Prague.
The wages of IT workers are high above the national average.
The most money will come in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hit chart.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubacka confirms.
The highest earnings will be achieved by technical directors.
In Prague and Brno, they can come to CZK 120,000 - 180,000.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but even there it does not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also in demand.
They can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK on board.
It's also about graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go directly to the employment office, this is not the case with IT students.
If companies overdraw and overpay an expert from another company, they are happy to reach for a graduate.
They can raise it their own way.
They can't do without their tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is suitable in any profession, but at least decent English is necessary for IT students.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a number of cases where companies are looking for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied with only average knowledge of English.
But if, for example, a support worker speaks more foreign languages, he is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds the director of Kubacka.
In Google, there's paradise.
Only quietly can Czech workers envy Google employees.
Of course, they have flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various part-time jobs, not only for mothers.
“The company gives new dads four extra weeks of leave after the baby is born,” said Google spokeswoman Martina Jonek.
Pampering also includes health care for employees and family, catering, transportation, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Anyone who wants to be educated has the green light, and it doesn’t matter what new things they want to learn.
But the benefits do not end there.
Such a full refrigerator for free is also definitely not to be thrown away.
Healthy lunch (in some areas breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchens in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the spokesperson reveals.
And so that nothing needs to be thrown away, he puts what he does not eat in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these on the Czech ratios of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“For Google, it’s not important that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions.”
The United Nations has sharply criticised Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the UN human rights commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "is seriously concerned that Bulgaria is not complying with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
“It is particularly disturbing to see how important and influential public figures are publicly expressing support for the criminal armed militias who brazenly hunt refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey,” he said.
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested," Zeid said.
Worse still, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned – for a year or longer – if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, compared with 21,000 last year.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer spending their leisure time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people from the sofas and leads them to activity.
Time spent in front of screens was originally shrunk to television, later to video games, and most recently to smartphones.
It’s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I’m talking about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, a character-based application that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the launch of this new game in early July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was then postponed due to the massive interest that led to server congestion.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on their smartphones go out to look for Pokémon that they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can “capture” them (via a screenshot on the phone) or “catch them”.
Mania has swept the generation who played the game at a younger age, lifting them from their seats and driving them out in search of Pokémon.
In the U.S., this game has seen a significant increase in the number of steps that the “average” person takes every day.
Apple’s watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of monitored people practicing for 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokémon Go is playing – it only sees rough data on exercise levels.
Many public campaigns aiming to “find 30,” “get up off the couch,” and “be active every day” have fallen on barren ground because most public health messages are boring and aimed at people who don’t look good.
The importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in controlling weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot list in full here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover the three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine. And fun.
Some people even make new friends while chasing Pokémon.
Of course, there are also some boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can come through the door.
What, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their day, smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity, but they didn’t give us a reason to do anything like this game.
The novelty catches on and interest in it begins to fall at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, other games will appear that will combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity and will help many people in pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No effort on the log.
Everyone was dumb in the plains.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight to the title in a multiplayer match on Thursday, surpassing the others on the full line under the Olympic spotlight.
The total score of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over silver medalist and team member of the "final five" Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a performance on the beam in the final of the individual multiplayer gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win a multiplayer, and the fifth overall, confirming her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the scoreboard and her long journey to this point was over, tears appeared on her face.
This success puts her in the same league of unique athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at world championships - including 10 gold medals. Her breathtaking line-ups are a blend of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton has called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between herself and the burden of too high expectations.
Anything other than returning home to her family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be perceived as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver medals in the women's singles final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was an exclamation point in the celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked forward to the summit during her long journey, but that's not entirely true.
Part of her line-up - the one that features her typical triple flip with double turns - is set in Latin music that would just fit home, in the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and where she gained strength.
She hasn’t lost a multiplayer competition since the summer of 2013 – a succession of victories that can continue for as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the lead for a short time through two turns, it was just an illusion.
Cladina and plain - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back in the lead with 15,433 points behind the log - and finished with 15,933 points in straights.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glittering red, white, and blue shadows, tears came to Biles as the wish she had once written in her diary came true.
Raisman's performance was somewhat revenge for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third place with Mustafina, but then she won the bronze because of the sum of the three best line-ups.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call “Grandma”, was well ahead.
She sent air kisses to the crowd after her ordinary, overcoming a return that at times seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it became a complete hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three Victims in Serial Killer Case Shot While Listening to Car Music
According to a police report released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities say Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis Maleah's daughter were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked on the driveway.
The report states that an armed man stood on the passenger's side and fired eight shots from a handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
Police say the robbery was not responsible for the triple homicide, as the attacker did not take the wallet or the $2,900 that one of the adult victims was carrying.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had anything to do with any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, a total of nine attacks occurred over the course of four months, killing seven people and injuring two others.
“It’s happening in the residential area in front of the houses,” Howard told CBS’ KPHO branch earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to say what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder, and police believe the serial killer was the culprit.
Investigators found shell casings and assembled a bullet from the bullet residue in the seat and under the bonnet.
Mother of six-year-old child with microcephaly: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mom.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is a consequence of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I was the first to think I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
“That’s not true,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent learn that Edmund may never know them, and that he may not survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
“My first reaction was that I didn’t think people would do that anymore,” Picciut said.
Edmund walks with a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still can't talk.
However, some milestones are slowly being filled.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth performs a sign language with which Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not common sign language -- he says Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciutova reminds us of the emotional tax that an uncertain future imposes.
I keep asking, “What’s next?”
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don’t expect anyone to be able to tell me.
Picciut, however, has encouraging news for mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and flooding require rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) reported that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi poured out from their shores and threatened with widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor’s office for national security and emergency preparedness, said they were receiving requests for water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only Tangipahoa District had asked for 10,000 bags of sand.
Flood patrols will remain in most of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The meteorological service said in a statement that another 8 to 13 centimeters could rain over the sea.
In southern Alabama, a flood patrol was on alert on Friday as rains continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River at Baton Rouge and the Amite River at Denham Springs are predicted to culminate over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of homes in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He added that the danger is flooding downstream in the Ascension district, where these flooded streams will flow only slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest recorded level at 9 a.m. local time on Friday.
Rescuers are still picking up people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in the southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step-son were among those rescued at Gloucester earlier on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had it up to my waist.
According to his wife, it is the highest level she has ever seen in 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family members are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they remained hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that with heavy rains continuing, the floods are “spreading rapidly” and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingston reported that 35 centimeters of rainfall fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily saturated since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and toll roads required residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of classes in five school districts.
The WWL branch of CBS reported that 200 homes had been flooded, according to an elder from Tangipahoa.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped in high water.
In Amite and Hammond, shelters were set up for those evacuated.
"They'll be able to come home when the water starts to drain," he said.
More than 20 streets in the Tangipahoa district of Hammond were closed due to flooding, and locals were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
"We had the last major floods here in March," said town manager Lacy Landrum.
The floods are going to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, emergency manager for Harrison County, Mississippi, said heavy rains continued on the Gulf coast.
He said several homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods at Amita, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown, 6 - "Boy Shot as a Shotgun," Survivor of Philadelphia Shooting
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia. This week it is already the second shooting at a 6-year-old child in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him as Mahayana Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot of it, his little body was shot to death," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe this.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should be cured.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three other men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, the other two victims are in stable condition.
According to the station, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia said there may have been a shootout between several armed men.
At the scene were found shell casings of weapons of attack type, belonging to various offensive weapons.
Apparently, it was definitely a continuing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one was arrested and police are investigating the video footage.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray bullet on Tuesday outside a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine the women’s gymnast team for this year’s Olympics, and for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
The number one gymnast for the past four years has been an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were first and second last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win gold in the women's singles multiplayer.
And team member Aly Raisman won the silver.
We are witnessing a sporting peak, but in gymnastics classes in the country it does not look so.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same journey to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the gymnasts' team for the next Olympic Games will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi trains.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport, and gymnasts train mostly in private gymnastics clubs that keep parents paying for training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their proxies and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich suburban areas that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training, and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is an expensive and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both coached athletes when they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls who inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly black and Hispanic) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, achievements at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics. And that is great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for demonstrating “girl power” and winning Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on a journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter further strikes
Ministers had hoped that a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would put an end to disagreements about the changes. But 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the elections rejected the contract.
Hunt unveiled plans to enforce the contract in July, saying the NHS was in “nobody’s land” and further delays would have a detrimental impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend work practices to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairwoman of the BMA’s Young Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly in the sense that there will be an escalation of the current labour crisis and thus fair treatment for all doctors.”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation have met with reluctance to engage the Dr. and often with deafening silence from the government.
And this despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for enforcement, and address the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike in late April, nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called to replace doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after concluding a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be a disagreement regarding the changes.
The BMA wants higher weekend pay for the 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS, urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “Industry action will achieve little or nothing, but it will put pressure on already overloaded teams and services and increase concerns, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Council of Young Physicians and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of oversight and whistleblower.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and gender pay gap - was a testament to how seriously the agreement was reached by the employers at BMA, Ministry of Health and Health Education.
A drug for sixty crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take the drug, which costs about sixty crowns (two pounds). The authorities recommend giving it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The anti-clotting medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of having another seizure in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or other seizure.
The NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be administered to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another stroke or heart attack.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is torn off, a blood clot can form, blocking blood access to the heart, and the development of a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, blocking the blood supply to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely to form.
The NICE proposal, published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Evaluation, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatments, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and will suffer another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the patient’s quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can extend the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Because there is limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially on the risk of bleeding - beyond three years, treatment beyond this period is not recommended in the proposal.
With the computer culture began to flourish fraud in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was sacked last year for corruption, linked to a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the disregard of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, according to a government report today.
Former Secretary of State Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticized police, election inspectors and city halls for ignoring voter abuse over “hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
A former community secretary, now ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said intimidation of voters based on their religion was so bad that police should make cordons in front of polling stations and protect wary voters.
He recommended that voters take their identity papers with them and be able to prove who they are in the elections.
Nowadays, voters need to give their name and address.
The report also suggests putting indelible ink on the fingers of people when casting their votes to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for greater access for the press to the documents of meetings and to decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“It’s not just about protecting against election fraud, it’s also about protecting the local government from the broader corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand,” he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the election scandal at Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the city's acting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his post following allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "cynically interfered" with the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, in his own words, “has conducted his campaign in such a way that it is the religious duty of devout Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes have been contested or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and issues to someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about the scams in the correspondence vote – which senior members of the Muslim community are said to have pressured people during the vote to vote for the candidates they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document.
“Evidence has been presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially in communities originating from Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
"Fears have arisen that ... state institutions have turned a blind eye to such behavior because of a 'politically correct' hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating correspondence votes to prevent “vote mining.”
The report, currently being evaluated by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider asking voters to provide proof of identity before voting.
Use indelible ink on the fingers of people when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Perform systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to a period of three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating submitted correspondence votes and electoral envelopes.
Give the police the authority to create cordons around the polling stations.
Change the laws to make it easier to prosecute those exerting illegal coercion under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibit photography in polling stations.
Require that only Englishmen (except Wales) work in the polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go to the polling stations individually.
Sir Eric criticised the London police, saying it was "surprising" that no criminal charges had been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The Electoral Court has ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of the evidence of the crime.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful “check of checkboxes” in the voter registration departments at the city hall.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court decision in the Tower Hamlets case was the wake-up call.
Our nation has the proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democrats, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threatens this reputation.
Crazy cycling doppelganger of Duchess Kate and other celebrity doppelgangers at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have fallen in love with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is far from the only athlete seeking gold this year to boast her own celebrity double - at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL Women's Column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
A member of the American archer team, Brady Ellison (left), has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, a number of people quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Team archer Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after his photos emerged, in which he resembles a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he had heard about his resemblance to Lee since he was a little boy.
"They don't see much resemblance, except for the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell star Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks Nathan is an “athletic version” of the actor from the movie Inception
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly dense eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov boasts not only the same brown skin and blonde hair as Annalyne McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the US team, fans say that he looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Probable women: football star Hope Solo (left) and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar face and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed similarities
On the Waves of Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of couples
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction that “the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are identical in truth.”
Soccer star Hope Solo and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter really have an incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medalist for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her beautifully wide smile, which as if copied the smile of the stars,Bralegirl Gabriel
CBC Olympic commentator apologises for saying Chinese swimmer "exploded"
Viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast of the Olympics on the CBC station was outraged by the analysis of the performance of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place in the women's 4x200 m freestyle relay race
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "slept like a stink" and "exploded" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald believed that his microphone had been turned off when, at the end of the women's 4<0xC3><0x97>200 m freestyle relay final, he began to spew his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring a “recovery” to the CBC’s commentary team, said, among other things: “That little 14-year-old from China has given up, you fool.”
Too much excitement, stretched like a stench, exploded.
Oh, thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race in 1:57.79 - that is 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadian women to reach China.
Viewers in Canada began to respond quickly online and were horrified by the tone and language the commentator used.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC broadcaster say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer ‘exploded’?????”
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China in the women's 4<0xC3><0x97>200 m freestyle relay final was described as: "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many demanded his impeachment
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn’t hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we'd be a bunch of racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on the swimmer's performance that leaked to the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that it happened.”
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to a comment
Scott Russell has apologised on MacDonald’s behalf.
CBC then copied and embedded their apology in a response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about comments made by commentator MacDonald.
The station also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, she shouldn't have gotten on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers in the broadcast and to those who follow us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by saying he didn’t want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay race," he said on CBC broadcast from the Olympics.
"I meant the swimmer's performance, not the swimmer's person as such."
"No need to say I had no intention of disrespecting you, and I'm very sorry."
Customers at Primark scandalized by woman who shamelessly tried her underwear in the middle of a store
When the woman undressed to try her panties on the sales floor in the middle of Primark, the shoppers were unsure which way to look.
To make matters worse, she tried to fit her size, took off her panties, and put them back in the shelf.
She continued to browse and finally tried four pairs of panties at a store in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flokestone.
Primark store at Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where a woman tried her panties before putting them back in the shelf
Two-child mother Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that the mysterious woman, after trying on her underwear, "put on her clothes again and walked out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties from the shelf, undressed her own panties and panties, and put them on.
"She wasn't even trying to find a discreet place - she was just standing there, impertinent as a monkey."
"Everyone was just staring at the way she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back in the shelf."
She did the same with three others before finally deciding she didn't like anything, getting dressed again, and leaving.
"She didn't seem to care who was looking - or even to think of the person who might be buying the panties she was trying."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else was wearing and nobody cleaned them is disgusting.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "When she left, I picked up the things she was obviously trying to pull out of the sale - which is also the only right thing."
"I'd be terrified to bring new panties home and find out that another woman was wearing them, undressing them, and that they weren't washed."
A Primark spokesperson said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our shop in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sales.
How to defend yourself against a gun attack using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain dominance over a rapist, whether he approaches you from the front or from behind.
If he approaches you from behind, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see your attacker and “have a free shot path.”
You will then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder just before hitting him in the face with a loose elbow.
Then he follows the knee to the groin, and while the attacker is bent in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit the main one in his face and start to retreat, holding the gun pointing at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it is a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab a gun and twist it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, give the weapon strength and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip and begin to retreat, still aiming at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of a robbery - unless you're a Grand Master Krav Maga - is to spend all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
The British traveler decided to put his immune system and breathing reflex to the test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Ian Wright, a 51-year-old Suffolk-born travel writer, licked a euro banknote, a Piccadilly Circus railing, a flush button on a train toilet and a Russian public telephone with his tongue to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was up to.
The experiment, which was based on the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train that thousands of other people have used may seem absolutely repulsive, but there are actually far more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Ian Wright spoke with doctors and health professionals throughout his journey across Europe about strengthening gut flora bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, nothing he licked left in his mouth was worse than a taste.
Ian Wright is famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on trips around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely - from public railings at train stations to the flushing system.
In the film he made about it, he says, “I haven’t taken much care of my health since I was a kid, and I put everything in my mouth, from clay to eating worms and muddy water.”
In the film, he confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But one public toilet in Russia refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60.
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy maker Valio have made a film called The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength, which shows bacteria counts in different places, such as in the bathroom.
In the movie, he said, "This is almost the ugliest thing I've ever felt in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything 'cause this place is disgusting.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen gut bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s senior vice president of snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would keep track of the enthusiasm and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of “let’s call Ian.”
It is said that interest in bowel health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context – good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a worldwide phenomenon, and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there is a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked something I wanted him to do - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I’m glad we licked some of the dirty stuff.”
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 that found that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and intestinal health, and 58 percent of respondents said they at least occasionally used products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of socially in need destroyed a community building in Saltash, Cornwall, before being evicted.
A family of socially needy people left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damage to their community home after being accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction from the house, the officials of the housing cooperative were shocked to learn that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, garbage was everywhere on the floor, and the walls were scratched.
The family has already moved out and is considered to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned about whether the house could be saved.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, as this property is likely to come to mind as a "not-so-nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is infamous, and their names are infamous.
The couple had three sons who occasionally stayed in the house, and police said the family’s reign of terror included street battles using baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screams, quarrels, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
Several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, were found stinking garbage.
In the house from which drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was torn out
Neighbors say they saw them fighting on the street, and people regularly called the police here.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after they were given an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved welcomed the eviction, saying that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, you can't count.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was an incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of neighborhood surveillance at Cornwall Housing, said the family was unable to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house
Waste and old toys were lying in the overgrown part of the municipal house
She adds: “It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept responsibility for her own conduct and that of her family, and eviction is always the last step Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, must have terrified her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and members of the local community who have bravely kept us informed.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbours and at the same time bring with it the message that we will not tolerate unsocial behaviour.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenant, who lived in the house at different times, were about 20 years old.
Polluted mattress, which after eviction remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house
Workers will now have to remove piles of garbage left around the house
In 2014, a shelf raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, scales, equipment and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed the money was intended for the foundation of a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth after being evicted.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate their lease rules
Angela Crow of the Denov and Cornwall police said the eviction was a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
“This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and to those who would like to follow that behavior,” she said.
The Denov and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal frightened after low flight of military jet plane over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun’s rays in Aveiro, Portugal, were frightened to death
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion Flying Incredibly Low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted that there was no security risk.
As the low-flying jet crashed over the crowded beach, the frightened tourists panicked.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane reaching a distance of almost a touch of sun-drenched people on a sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to get up after they were disturbed by the noise of the jet engines without seeing what would come out of the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic overflight on social media, said: "The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to crash."
Nuno Arroja adds, “I was surfing and I really thought the plane was going to fall on my head.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when a low-flying plane emerged from the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to descend low because that was the only way to inspect the ship.
The plane reportedly flew slightly lower than normal due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires, but the aviation insists that the safety of people was not compromised.
Forest fires this summer ravaged part of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said the pilot had to fly low because of thick fog and smoke from fires that prevented his view.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats as part of the training.
Half of the funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>OI) found this out during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services most often do not inform the survivors about their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
<0xC4><0x8C>OI imposed 41 fines for this in the total value of 73,000 crowns.
Her spokesman, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Fröhlich, informed about this today.
Inspectors found errors in 47 of the 95 checks.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at different prices than agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially uncertified gauge.
Therefore, the inspection banned the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This concerned the packaging of urns, candle covers and vases, which were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Given that there are still violations of the law in this specific area of services, the inspection action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, had died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family had learned of her death in Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was presumably killed in a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, a bastion of the group in the country.
The 17-year-old Sultana, according to her family, died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with going to a war zone - is to discourage people from ever making decisions," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then boarded a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultans’ family learned that they had married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and were widowed within a few months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he will leave Garland as a Supreme Court candidate.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he believes Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the person who replaces the deceased Supreme Court Justice will be elected by the future president.
During a conference call on Thursday, Reid said he believed Clinton would choose Garland “with a certain degree of credibility.”
Reid’s spokeswoman later said he did not directly talk to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and that he was merely speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "crush the ship" by choosing someone else.
Garland is chairman of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's appointment were "subordinates" and "subordinates" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for "women and men"
Treats is working closely with photographer David Bellemer to release the 2017 calendar, inspired by the Pirelli calendar of the 1970s.
But instead of revealing celebrities, they are trying to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from the old-school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to go back to depicting timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of a woman’s body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a wonderful piece of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys vinyl records?
Vinyl is loved by single middle-aged men.
Before you decide to overwhelm the comments section with peppery notes under the pseudonym Not All LonelyMenInThe Middle Ages, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of phonograph records is associated not with the millennial boom, who want to enjoy the originality of owning a physical object, but with the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who have recently bought a vinyl album are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It’s not really an accumulation of enthusiastic fans – it all has an emotional dimension: older people who buy records are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and are more likely to be alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were broadcast as a television reportage, the camera would be watching me head out into the busy streets of Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesticulating broadly. Then I would stop, reach out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at this."
Well, let's take a look.
As Soho’s charm and charm slowly fades from the heart – buildings once occupied by independent vendors, now filled with hotels, restaurants and canteens, clothing and office supplies – a few fantastic specialty record stores remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while, and I would stand close to different men in these shops and try to observe their age and emotional mood.
Stuart, 55, a native of Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and is looking at shops to fill in a few hours of time.
I asked him if he was a collector.
"I think so," he said.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
All these recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he sent me a photo by e-mail, I did not follow him home).
He also has this huge number of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy records that he could not afford when they were originally released, and he buys again what he sold in his youth and did not even have a vinyl.
“A lot of what I buy is from the late 60’s and early 70’s. These are things that I would have issued when I was 11 or 12. I was too small at the time and couldn’t get them,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves, and adds: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez, 25, works at Sister Ray and also thinks that many of the customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave, people who had heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old record back.
According to my interviews, people dispossessed their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back,” he says.
This could explain the boom of record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of phonograph records?
It doesn’t take you more than a few seconds in a store like Phonica to find out that in music stores you’ll find a pleasant community of people with similar mindsets.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of record labels may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of record labels, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I’m a collector myself, and I think so with a lot of people.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We’re all like their social workers!” replies a co-worker from a pile of records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who had purchased a vinyl album a month earlier had not listened to it yet.
According to the survey, 41% of those surveyed have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables do not have a turntable.
At this point of the report, he probably looked seriously anxious as he crawled through the heap of bossa nova compilations.
The aspect of the "trophy" and the revival of interest is something that Jonny (42), who works at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men), noticed.
“Someone recently came in and said, ‘I don’t have a turntable yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
The percentage is not very high, but it happens.
It's more about the product side than the music.
People come to us and say, "I don't have a gramophone."
These are the younger people, not the older, grown-up teens who get into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently dedicated to turntables, has much more diverse visitors when I arrive.
There are couples of seventy-somethings, tourists taking photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn’t as relaxed as shops used to – with speakers echoing the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synths and sex instead of pulling jazz, it’s good to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but an intrusive mental trauma is hard to guess when you’re standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanor, 27, walks around Fopp for a few minutes and watches various records at a discount.
She's one of those people who prefers to look at expenses rather than spend it feverishly.
According to her, she does not earn much, so it is not possible to collect records.
It costs a lot of money.
It’s easy to listen to music on the computer or something, but the records have their magic...” he sighs eagerly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is the store that allegedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very biased about the calves of girls in tight jeans, and I watch a group of teenage girls just clustering around Polaroid cameras, and then father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's records: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of records.
No one is looking at them -- maybe because they're just for decoration, and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's a pure vinyl trick.
But because any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's not much to complain about.
It’s no surprise that the demographic area, where there’s more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where the most is spent on the most luxurious goods that vinyl certainly is.
But while, according to my findings, the YouGov results seem to be accurate – that is, at least in record stores, they do not take into account the large number of vinyl collectors and lovers that exist in reality, in record stores and on online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly doesn’t spend his Thursday morning wandering around the record stores on Berwick Street, scrolling through the records, and avoiding the sight of a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female, estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old, measuring five meters.
French court refuses to tear down shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an order by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to shut down a total of 72 makeshift stores where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, sell tea for 50 cents in makeshift restaurants or basic dishes for a few euros.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that the sites need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they imply fire hazards and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations in the court said shops and restaurants were vital and that free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups did not provide food supplements for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Controversial makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 temporary businesses, but said the prefect’s objections were “completely understandable.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role to play than just serving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said the premises provide quiet places for refugees and volunteers to meet.
One of the places threatened with demolition was a cafe in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, run by a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals a day, lessons of English and French, and asylum counselling for hundreds of unaccompanied minors at risk in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the “children’s” cafe.
The Guardian received a letter saying that closing the café “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
The charity Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer has risen to more than 9,000 - the highest ever.
He thought he was dead.
Ul<0xC4><0x8D> resurrects himself and the volleyball <0xC3><0x9A>stí.
"From March I could train normally," he reported at the start of summer preparations in full force.
What's the matter with you?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, then heart problems because of it.
Because when I was at the Universiade in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn't know it.
It hurt, no one found anything for me.
Then the clot got up.
There is a broken vein in the calf, which will hurt all the time, especially when it works hard or the weather changes.
But nothing that would limit me, rather an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
He did.
Last year at the summer tournament in D<0xC5><0x99>ev<0xC4><0x9B>nice I did not know that I had an embolism, and I could not move there at all.
I vomited blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was completely done for five more days.
I really thought I was dead in the woods, my girlfriend and my family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's only going up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to be more vigilant when I'm flying somewhere.
But anything can be done about it.
Just when I wanted to go back to the preparation of P<0xC5><0x99>íbram last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock it, I'm physically better than I was before.
What do you expect from Usti?
I look forward to it, the band looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers coming.
Let's hope we sit down humanely so that we can fit it together.
Do you lift the mouth?
It had a reputation for being an outcast, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now finished second.
There is a new team in <0xC3><0x9A>stí, there are only a few players left.
It was the last in the extraliga, so there is a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first rounds who's gonna be the punk, but we're not.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He is already experienced and has experienced a lot, he will think better than the last place.
But my arrival didn't have anything to do with him. I made an appointment earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I am a great friend and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say the name.
Eventually, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He has a great name, he has been in good clubs, he has been training for many decades, he is a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke and I like to get an opportunity in a not so top team.
I was in P<0xC5><0x99>íbram for two years, but <0xC3><0x9A>stí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a foreigner, an Australian Boehm is already training in <0xC3><0x9A>stí.
What does he look like?
I happen to know him, at the Universiade we played against each other in a group.
And we talked a few times there, sometimes we sat together in the evening after the games, so we already know each other as friends.
We beat them 3:1, I immediately threw it at the start of summer preparation in <0xC3><0x9A>stí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's cute.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze will arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote to an American, he looks like a nice guy, a Brazilian, who knows how he will speak English.
Did you contact the American?
Seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so I'm the one who creates, so I should be communicating with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of players they are, I found them on the Internet, how they play, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a couple of messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'll fit in with us.
How do you look forward to being the record number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm 24 years old and I don't have the temper to switch.
I'd rather be in the middle of something, I'd rather be leading the team than someone else.
I don't think I'd want to play anymore if I had to be like a second recorder and do it full-time.
How many times have you been number one?
Half a year in P<0xC5><0x99>íbram, when Kust could not do it as a captain, he was injured, then there were problems with money and he left.
Since then, we've been climbing up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, where I was raised, I alternated between one and two.
It was an excellent year in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and I chose P<0xC5><0x99>íbram.
Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice wanted me from there, I stayed, but I did not finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short position remains the Phelps domain.
"Being back on the podium and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother were once again cheering in the auditorium; this time Boomer's son was sleeping quietly with headphones in his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started racing and in a few hours it will be over, he said touchedly.
In the final behind Phelps almost two seconds behind the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long position.
The bronze medal was won by Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championships.
After Al Oerter (disc) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to have mastered the same discipline in four consecutive games.
For most of the race, Phelps was led by another American, Ryan Lochte, and home-grown Thiago Perreiro.
While the gold defenders in the final crawler’s fifty put on a crushing finish, they fell out of the medal positions.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the official announcement of the position, he advanced to the final of the 100-meter bow tie race.
The legend could not be overshadowed by the compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won a double - after a hundred won in Rio and doubled the track.
In the final, the Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin left 37-hundredths behind, the Russian Evgeny Rylov finished third.
While Murphy is only fifth out of 200 at last year’s World Cup, he has become a badge king in Rio.
From the imaginary throne deposed Larkin, which the same double succeeded in last year's world championship.
He won a medal at the Olympics just now.
Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel shared the gold at the 100.
For sixteen-year-old Oleksiakova, it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuela the second after silver from the relay.
At the Olympics, she was the first African-American woman to win swimming gold.
I hope I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sport will become love for them and they will get to where I am, said Manuel.
The third was the Swede Sarah Sjöström, who won the world record bow tie race in Rio and still has silver from the 200.
Australian record holder Cate Campbell finished sixth.
Rie Kanet, a Japanese athlete, won the 200th Olympic medal at the age of 27.
It has no precious metal even from the World Championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russian Yulia Yefimova, who, despite her doping past, is struggling with the resentment of spectators and opponents because of the start at the games.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering those questions.
“I’m tired of it,” said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was enforced by a special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the Games.
They handled my appeal, and I won.
Whether they like it or not, or if they have a different opinion, they should go to the arbitral tribunal.
Disappointed, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs had a special day.
Less than an hour before the match, they knew who they were going to play against.
They had to do the tactical preparations lightning-fast.
And then, at an unconventional time, they started the game on small court number one.
The first set did not start well, then they reached the lead of the opponents, but at 19:19 they did not manage to finish.
In the second, they were clearly better and straightened out, but the decisive tie-break did not work for them.
Above all, a number of broken services meant a loss at 10:15 and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermann said.
How would you rate the match?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start, before I played, we got into the game beautifully.
At the end of the last balloon, I lost the income I was used to before.
We lost a hundred, which was crucial.
In the next set we stepped on them with an overview on the field, another defense and we pushed on the service.
The tie-break was a terribly spoiled submission, that's where we went down this side.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat the Russians.
Sluková: It’s a shame to start the first set, that’s where we missed it.
We were able to pull it off, but we were missing the spikes.
The second set was great and in the third set the service decided.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and it was about those five, there we hesitated a lot.
It's a pity, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the small courtyard No. 1?
Sluková: Same as in China in the side yards.
The environment and atmosphere was different.
It was one o'clock at night, complete silence, no music playing, nothing.
It was a difference from the center.
We wouldn't choose those conditions, but we can't choose.
How was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was strange.
We started warming up for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn’t do the tactical preparation as we did for the other teams.
But Simon (Nausch) had prepared a tactic for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactic papers, so we were pretty well prepared on this side.
Do you ever start a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at 11:30, but not at 12.
Block of Russian Birlov in the play-offs at the Olympics in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermannová in a hug in the play-offs at the Olympics in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Sluková: Having played the last two games in a group of ten, we had a regime shifted earlier.
That was two more hours.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine that any other sport has athletes who have to deliver their best performance in twelve hours.
But I think we prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it’s not typical and it’s probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you assess the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the group’s progress was our goal, on one hand it’s okay, good.
We did what we told each other.
But now I'm sad after the game.
Sluková: I will sleep through it and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big Brother is here, the first surveillance SIM is coming.
You can't escape it.
The new rules will apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM card from one of the local operators while staying in Thailand.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas, for example, who work in Thailand or married there.
Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, said there would be no exceptions.
The national telecoms regulator introduced a plan to sell SIM cards exclusively to foreigners in early August.
The new measure, which will allow monitoring of their location, the authorities intend to introduce within six months.
According to Tantasith, this is a means of maintaining national security, which will allow to solve criminal activities committed by foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs are also intended to help detect people who exceed the allowed length of stay.
Within six months, a special SIM for foreigners should appear alongside the SIM intended exclusively for Thais.
The difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently turned on for cards intended for people without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This feature is not for Thais because we can always easily track them," Tantasith added.
It should be added that in Thailand, subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires a proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators gave a free start-up SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are considering introducing the same measure as Thailand.
They also currently have a mandatory SIM registration, but the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not imply an obligation for foreigners to acquire a local operator when entering the SIM country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of a given country only know the relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after the SIM has logged in to their network.
They have a phone number, but no information about the owner.
However, the difference in roaming prices from the rates of local operators is so abysmal that even most tourists during their stay in Thailand begin to look for local SIMs.
The authorities’ attempts to supervise the movement of foreigners have received immediate criticism from foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith reassures the situation and, in connection with the protection of privacy, compares the upcoming system to the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, if necessary, the police will need a court order to track a specific person.
Any misuse of the system will be subject to an unspecified penalty.
“If the service provider monitors the SIM location without a court order, it will be charged with a crime,” Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number will currently only be recycled after the 90-day period after which the SIM did not log in to the network, the number could be recycled after 15 days if you leave Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the care of the property is provided by the administrator.
The condition was sufficient parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which essentially disqualified the older development.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with swinging the floor, high energy intensity and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern flat.
The entire interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Poláková from Artiga studio.
Why did you contact them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone if he is designing an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client's wishes, are able to appropriately harmonize the interior.
We worked with architect Lenka Langerová on our mountain apartment, then based on the personal recommendation of another client, and given that everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us when renovating our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social and living space with adequate facilities for a family of four conceived as a modern, but not cool interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with the terraces and to realize the intelligent control of the household.
And of course, the quality of execution had to be monitored.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you yourself interfere with the final form of the interior?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expected from the design and showed some of the interior elements that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors, including works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysil, Václav <0xC5><0xA0>pála or Otto Gutfreund, helped the architect to orient herself in our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the architect’s idea as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then verified together with visualizations that everything fits together.
Were there any complications during the realization, because of which you had to give up the original ideas or, on the contrary, take on new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction site at the moment when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we planned, in fact, shield the surrounding buildings.
Then we literally changed the layout overnight from the ground up.
Granite was used on the kitchen line and on the cladding of the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, for example, on the upholstery of the dining and bar chairs Norma by Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you making any changes or is there something you would like to have differently today?
I believe that this is a modern airy interior, which primarily fulfills its purpose.
We are not going to make changes, most of the changes after moving in took place in the level of shielding and occupancy of the terraces.
Perhaps the only reproach is to the floor, when the walnut wood turns out to be too delicate for a household with a dog.
Word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout and several other modifications.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of light ducts in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilet.
Thus, we got the daylight into the darker areas of the apartment.
Also, the direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
You are not negative compared to the French, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, near the Spanish border.
I've moved a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which led me to work in a magazine.
Why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was starting to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere between people.
I think every Frenchman is very negative.
People in France are negatively inclined in general, but it has gotten worse lately.
It is interesting that you mention negativity.
This is how some people evaluate the Czech character.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not feel this way when they come to France, because they do not perceive it as such as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
A big issue is money.
People feel that they have little money, and the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which in my opinion is enough.
Now there is a problem with the behavior of people towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look me over the shoulder just because I was Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That’s why I didn’t feel good in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job practically anywhere else and I came across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I have to admit that I did not know Prague at all in the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my dad even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn’t know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a different atmosphere.
Maybe it’s because I don’t speak Czech, so I can’t capture any negative reactions or insults, but I feel that people here are more free.
That I could do anything, dress anything, and no one would judge me.
In France, someone is always looking at you in an unpleasant way, even when you have special clothes and so on.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think the Praguers care about such things.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then one of my friends and I started a website where people offer and search for shared housing.
We are currently operating only in Prague, but we would like to extend this to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends who are half Czechs, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say that another specificity of Czechs is that they initially keep more distance.
They don't let anyone get close to their body.
That's quite a difference from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses their cheeks.
It's different here, but I understand that it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem?
On the contrary, I have it quite simple in Prague, because probably everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evening or in the grocery store.
I would love to learn English, but I don’t have that much time.
And by the fact that everyone can communicate at least a little bit in English, I do not have such a need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Is it because you are a Muslim?
No, not really.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My manager, a Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They are not French, they are Africans.
I'm pretty touched by that.
But that someone would have a problem with me being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
Even though a colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown, that I'd be cursed.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that nowadays anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I could not have imagined that such a thing would happen in France.
And it is not just about Muslims.
Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even if I shouldn't feel that way.
I try not to follow the violence reports too much, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that isn't really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at Ji<0xC5><0x99>ího z Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad Square.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians protested against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they have to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues are, for example, from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have a pretty wild discussion about Islam because we all see it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, maybe they learned Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate status of women.
How do you see it?
I don’t feel inferior in any way.
Rather the other way around.
I am a woman, I have strength.
It also means that you don’t wear a headgear.
The hijab?
This is mainly due to the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a true Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on how everyone interprets it.
When a person reads the Quran, he should make his own opinion about these things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur’an that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself, I am not the Prophet’s wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and when I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where scarves are required, I take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I've never felt so good anywhere else.
I’ve been thinking about Poland for a while, but I’m fine in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is an ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians, protested against violence.
The yachtswoman Kozelska Fenclová was driven by the wind in Rio.
Friday’s rides at sea in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were performed by Czech yachtswoman Veronika Kozelské Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, she advanced to tenth place ahead of the final two races.
This would ensure the Czech Republic’s participation in the final race.
Collect the packages like Pokémon.
They want to compete with carriers.
TV director Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger are behind the idea of using the already planned routes for the transport of consignments.
With the idea, they breathed life to three applications with different geographical reach.
We launched the national application in May.
At the moment, there are thousands of cities uploaded in it, and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first before we focus more on abroad, says the 41-year-old manager in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the app work and who can benefit from it?
You can download it and register for free.
Then you can specify the route and data, how big the package can be transported and how much you want for it.
Somebody might be asking for a ride that day.
When the route and time of delivery are suitable, it is paired and both receive mutual notification.
At that moment, a chat room opens, where the couple arranges a handover.
How many people would you estimate would have to register for each package to always find its courier?
I do not know the ideal condition, I cannot estimate how many registered and how many paths are needed to ensure that the coverage is completely optimal and each offer is paired with demand.
It already works on the main draws and it is logically easier than, for example, on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also building trust and discover that no one escapes with the package.
Did you not have to deal with such a case yet?
How many users have the service after two months of launch?
Currently, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people creating roads.
We see this as a success and we hope that more will be added.
Is there a risk that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to compete for large conglomerates simply because we are able to deliver the item on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
In a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
You may pay a hundred or less here, because this is the path someone is already taking.
Should traditional carriers be worried about a possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, huge multinational carriers feed here, as well as retail chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality does not correspond to what they pay for.
No one wants to find a note in their mailbox telling them to pick up the parcel at the branch office, first on the day after 7:00 p.m.
At that time I needed the package for six hours and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and more functional service that does not annoy anyone and sends a signal to the competition, no matter how hard they try.
Marek Greger (41) and Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka (39).
Neither has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a manager of the music club, Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka as a TV director.
In 2014, they began to prepare the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already scheduled trips between the world’s metropolises, especially by airplane, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to be processed by a company that created applications for example for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or <0xC4><0x8C>SFD.
Programming took three quarters of a year and the application was launched in March 2016.
They started developing the Preveza app in December last year and released it in May this year.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
They have been developing the Monthly and Monthly Profi app since January this year and made it available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to make all these applications, which one day will merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The shared economy has been a topic lately, and this is a service like AirBnB or Uber.
Are you not worried about operating in an area that no one can tell you much about yet, where the boundaries of sharing are and where the grey economy is?
It's the same, just a different product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be another thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even if someone saves and someone earns, it is not the intention to bypass tax authorities and tax controls.
Every user, on one side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make income from it.
What makes you think the service has such great potential?
The sender saves and the carrier earns or reduces the cost of the trip.
This is the strong idea that unites interest on both sides.
In the age of social media that divides people, we would like this one to bring people together.
They can create nice stories, people are happy to help someone and they will tell about it.
For example, someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
I think people have been missing a personal approach for a long time, we say about this application that it is a service of people to people.
So how do you make sure the courier doesn't run away with the package?
Each user of the application together with the registration scans the ID card and indicates the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give credibility to the service and the person.
Couriers also collect stars based on senders’ ratings.
We also offer insurance, we still fine-tune the details.
The courier is liable for uninsured shipment in case of loss or damage, but does not accept responsibility for the contents under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If he is stopped by the police and found in a sealed package in his trunk a submachine gun or ten kilos of hashish, criminal responsibility falls on the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered persons are, if necessary, traceable by the administrative body, which will be the only one who will have the opportunity to look into it, even we ourselves are not able to see them, the data is protected against misuse.
How much money will the courier receive after successful delivery of the parcel?
The courier determines the price and receives the full amount he asks for.
The sender will be charged a few percent extra for the mediation of the contact.
This money is our profit, but it is only a few percent, because we want to push volume.
Also, no one can accuse the courier of not delivering the parcel when it was actually delivered, both the pick-up and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any limitations?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can carry anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plateau of eggs and large as a bass beer.
After that, there are no more restrictions, and if someone has space in the car, they can carry a refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier can see what he wants.
You don’t even have to pack a thing unless you explicitly want to hide the content.
You put a forgotten hoodie in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the service?
A friend had an idea more than two years ago, I didn’t pay much attention to it at the time.
Then he showed me a demo application with a transnational reach that mainly targets air passengers.
At that moment, I told him that I would not look for an investor, but I wanted to become one myself and put savings into it.
It took another year of development before we established Shippansee LTD in London to increase the credibility of the entire product.
But this is not the version you are focusing on right now.
No, we focused marketing on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to catch up on the application, because it all had birth pains and there is still something to solve and improve.
We try to respond to customer feedback and we do not deal with the foreign market as much at the moment.
We know it’s a long run, but we don’t rush, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in some way upgrades.
The takeover was created when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn this in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the Moon is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the carrier, but the difference is that as a courier you see the shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile phone.
The application for couriers who want to make a living from it, we called the Month of Profi.
So someone can make a living picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last application will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make a trip to work.
Now that everyone's messing with the Pokémon, they can collect this the same way.
A person sees where the orders are around the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it must be delivered and transports the shipment.
It is set cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment, we are also creating a web interface that will be central for companies to send shipments, fill in data on the web about them, or create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice them for the use of the service every month.
Are you currently working on the full-time project?
It burdens us, but we have it normally at work, so that we can support and develop the project.
There is no strong multinational investor behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other incentives and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage not the Czech market with us, but who should go with us to the global product and become another huge player in the market such as AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will fix the second part, and the solo game in it will be more colorful than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is to be based on the concept of network struggle in the first part.
Therefore, you can enjoy the freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, includes the possibility of using combat titanium.
In addition to the action passages, the game will contain levels aimed at agile movement.
They will resemble platform games and include puzzles.
Therefore, double jumps, wall running and rope gliding are essential to overcome them.
In addition, sometimes it will be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will also be maps reminiscent of mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and lower platforms and close massive doors.
You will adjust the shape of the battlefield.
As a result, the pace of the game should oscillate between fierce action and quieter moments to explore an unknown planet.
We'll be playing pawn Jack Cooper dreaming of a career as a pilot.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper, along with Captain Lastimosa, crashes on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
Neither will the wilderness there be gracious to him.
In addition, Lastimosa will be fatally wounded in the crash, and Cooper will be tasked with putting the captain's titan into operation.
His dream of becoming a pilot will come true sooner than he expected.
The first step is to steal the battery needed to repair the robot.
Cooper's calls with the titan will also be significant.
Players will use it as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time the robot's depersonalized communication will create humorous moments.
For example, if the titanium will dryly list all the injuries that Cooper faces during the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 came from the Polygon server.
In addition, the result can be judged in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 will be released on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand will come to life, but the original publisher remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changed its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ in 2013, THQ acquired a number of its brands and the right to use its logo and company name.
Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and the Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 more games are being created for the publishing house, and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, when I was retiring, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a twenty-years younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - she had obviously been trying for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she's dated him before me.
She's totally crazy about him.
In those first days, her voice had even changed, she had such a girly, in love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I watched the whole thing.
He was out of work at 3:30, so she always left at 3:00 to go shopping.
Every day she tried to see him.
Later I found out that they were meeting at his house, in the laundry.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got the keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, in the end I always stayed home.
I've never been able to go there, to take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife controlled me mentally.
Soon, I think, she found out that I was controllable, that I would do whatever she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just a slipper.
My neighbors told me they knew that too.
I was such an asshole that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke up, it would be bad.
That it would happen to everyone in the family, only the daughter knew something.
So I've always put it off, on and on.
One day, I went to his apartment to ask for help in the laundry room.
He went with me, and I told him that I had gotten anonymous, that he was seeing my wife, and that it all hinted at that.
I asked him what he would say.
He stood there, shrugging his shoulders, staring down at the ground, not saying a word.
Then, too, I met his wife once on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn’t react to it and didn’t tell me anything either.
Nobody told me anything at the time.
I'm the kind of guy who's never really gone out, who has a hard time meeting someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about getting a divorce.
I was always hoping that one day it would end.
I figured I'd forgive her for all that, and life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've basically never come to terms with it.
I still have it in me to this day.
I used to show it to her quite often, but in the end I let it go for the sake of peace.
He still lives in the next house, and I still live with her.
It's just that it's more like my wife's my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's hardworking.
I always wanted to make sure I had no other reason to complain.
And she's kind, you might say.
But sometimes I want to caress her, hug her, and she won't let me.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks about what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me that she never loved me.
She loved me, but she didn’t love me.
And I see that she loves him to this day, he is her god.
And I'm tired of this kind of life.
Already when it started and I was taking it very badly, I once told her that I didn’t want to live, and I asked her what she would say to it if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
After the terrorist attacks, France intensifies its fight against radical Islamists and calls for help from the government and the local Muslim minority.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritually educated people in France preach in the country.
It also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where jihadist preachers often come with money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already at that time, it was supposed to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But she was soon struck by internal contradictions, and she never functioned properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former Interior and Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of a secular state.
There are about 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in France, about 120 of them serving radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled some 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and several other dozen are considering the move.
German police also intervened against jihadist clerics this week.
The imams were reportedly recruiting fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated the area where the believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, there was a debate in France about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All this was accelerated by other terrorist attacks carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radical Islamists.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources, and also to supervise imams.
However, it is not yet clear where he will get the funding, although several proposals are under consideration.
One of them is a special tax on halal food, that is, primarily on meat derived from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food vendors for the granting of permits.
Some of the money would go to the foundation’s budget.
A contribution of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 could also be paid by French pilgrims traveling to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 people leave France for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, French mosques should be open only to preachers who have completed educational programs at their universities.
As a result, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government is also shutting down radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 since December, and more will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and disrespect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown gunman Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Spain's Zaragoza, the Independent newspaper reported.
The shooting took place after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car outside the mall, from where he started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital uninjured daughter, for the man in critical condition had to come an ambulance.
The crime occurred around 11 a.m. in the central metropolis of the Autonomous Region of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Rolls with asparagus, wakame algae, ginger and chili sauce.
Summer wishes light, well-digested meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our head.
And so from the summer gardens smells grilled necks, bacon, pork lap.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, still so sometimes except for salad or roasted vegetables.
True, barbecue is time-saving and utensils, moreover, it is a social matter and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives, how to make good delicacies, which are special dining, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to boil, bake, fry or stew anything.
They will also contribute to our health.
Whether it is homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-known griffins are enough to make the preparation fun and food itself a real exotic delicacy.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
There is even a time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
The paper can only be softened into the water for a moment, and then it only depends on the imagination of the chef, how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
It's not an algae like an algae.
The advantage of many dishes of Asian cuisine today is that raw materials are usually already available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the real pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several types of vinegar and ginger.
Therefore, it is enough to buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the appendix with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes in various ceremonial occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are very common in many countries in Asia or South America also as a "help" for the preparation of various baked, cooked and fried dishes, which is packed in them similarly to aluminum foil.
A banana leaf will then give the dish a specific flavor.
They can be bought in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
But choose only the leaves of rich green, and therefore healthy - undisturbed and spotless.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad from wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
You can buy it frozen again.
Who often eats or prepares sushi, probably will know especially nori algae.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is made by chopping, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves - i.e. slabs intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame – a dark green algae that grows in the waters around Hokkaido Island – is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the nori algae.
By the way, who would not know miso soup with wakame, reportedly Asian women have used it since ancient times for postpartum recovery.
In fact, this eyelash has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses the blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents graying of hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and crushed wakame also serves as a spice, for example, to flavor rice.
Fresh algae are first leached in water, then rinsed, put in boiling water and boiled for half a minute.
Then they are cooled in ice water, cut out the central ribs and further prepared, for example as a favorite salad.
However, buying it ready-made, frozen is the easiest solution.
So it remains only to wrap a roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a bomb of longevity.
If you resist and do not add extra grilled beef.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a bit of dexterity, and you have an interesting fresh food that combines tastes deliciously.
And it's done once or twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green asparagus, 60 g of lettuce cucumber, 60 g of wakame algae and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of manga and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
First we prepare the rolls.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then remove it and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, cook the asparagus shoots briefly in hot water, after about three minutes, let them cool quickly into ice water so that they do not lose color.
Place the filling of vegetables on the allowed paper and wrap.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and cucumbers, cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chilli sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
Put the asparagus sprouts on the banana leaf, add the rolls and at the end decorate the whole dish with wakame algae, pickled ginger, a slice of mango, sprinkle with black sesame and add a couple of pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven-day rugby, Fiji takes gold
The impressive performance of the UK in seven-point rugby ended in a devastating footprint on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated the British in the final match on Thursday night at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio high 43-7.
The Fijians had taught a masterful lesson in processing, landfill, dodging, supporting play, running on the line, and brute force—and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unbeatable consolation prize in the form of a silver medal – for Britain the third of the day – and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic tournament of seven-man rugby, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A 7–5 win over the South Africans in the semi-finals on the same day may have frozen in the final.
However, Fiji in its form would defeat the 15-member team in full health.
It may not be a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their necks tomorrow: the head coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, the Adelaide Sevens lost every game.
They lost the only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began magnificently, the penetrations of the British reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a row of buses in motion, and the World Cup champions were leading 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The timer showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great Mitchell tried to stop the giant Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring a third time, but only slowed down the Fijians.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another on his return, and the clock still had more than 1 minute left... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouou then penetrated the drowsy British and landed on the line where he scored.
After the conversion to 29:0, there was a break.
It was as if Fiji was born for 7s rugby while the British were still learning to pass.
That's exactly how it is.
The British made massive changes after the half-time and stopped the Fijians' attack... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after a brilliant interplay Fiji Joshua Tuisov penetrated further.
Dan Norton tried to get the opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown in the left corner to raise an 36:7. But the game was won long ago by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands, and their fans sang, waved flags and danced in the parades.
It was hard not to admire the utterly joyful attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame sweetened the Fijians' victory with another attempt.
The whistle rang, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely beaten.
The same day, Fiji beat Japan 20–5 in the semi-finals, and the United Kingdom beat South Africa in the close semi-finals - by a difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown took the South Africans to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
The great late dump of Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from England's 15-man team, secured the victory - and finally the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win rowing race inspired coach's battle with cancer
You won’t find more emotional gold on these Games – and that’s a lot to say.
From the first shot to the last, during the 220 punishing exhalations in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio de Lagoa.
Even though there were two seats, there were three voices in the ship. When the ship was hovering on the surface towards the second Olympic gold in a row in the race of women's pairs, the voice of the still present coach Robin Williams was still with them in the ship. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their supremacy was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unbeaten.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying on the water with the elegance of a swan - does not reflect the nature of victory altogether.
Behind every rowing gold medal is a battalion of helping hands that make a difference piece by piece, and no hands have been helped more than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I had bladder cancer that could be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It will change your view of things a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The good news for the trio was that they were able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, off-season, and thus reduce the downtime to a minimum - if we can call it that in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That was an impulse.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but this was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, speaking less than usual as he tried to manage his own restlessness.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment who has completed a mission in Afghanistan, said: “I’ve been down with emotion this week, maybe it’s a little extreme, but it means so much.”
It underscores once again how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and Robin too.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anyone, so thanks to him, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have asked for a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The couple set a staggering rhythm that their rivals couldn't match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We concentrated as much as possible at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It is really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we did not want to achieve something fabulous.
We weren’t looking forward to today’s fireworks, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year to think before deciding what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, with TV adventurer Steve Backshall as her bride-to-be.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it would be my last race.
That would put too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better about it,” she said.

Prison?
Rather, let them drive people for free, says taxmafia hunter Rube<0xC5><0xA1> to a groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former city hall official in Prague are, according to <0xC4><0x8C>T, defendants.
You have made a series of reports in which you have exposed the fraudulent practices of even those who are supposed to be in the group that will go to trial.
You've faced several unpleasant skirmishes with the actors exposed.
To what extent is the report of the indictment of members of an organized group a breakthrough for you?
I thought there was going to be a trial.
I am particularly curious about the verdict.
I don’t think they should be in prison.
It's useless.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them so that they can drive all the people for free.
This is a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean that you do not see the punishment as sufficiently effective?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so afraid they're not doing the job anymore.
For example, one makes pingles, another delivers pizza, and one completely abandons it.
The defendants could theoretically be sentenced to two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with imprisonment.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in such a case, is nonsense.
Such people should return the companies they took from her.
For a quarter of a century, they have done what they have done, destroying our country’s name and filthyly robbing people.
So let them make a good business card and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine anything else.
It would work as a community service.
As someone goes to collect garbage, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get a parole eventually, and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek Film Academy in Písek and subsequently at Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Bata University in Zlín.
It belongs to the people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the Internet television Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programs, and is currently preparing the Prague Guide program, which is intended primarily for foreign audiences.
Rube<0xC5><0xA1> advises those in the form of short reports, which services in Prague should be avoided and which ones he recommends to use without fear.
Previously, he shot a series called How to Do it, City of Scams?, Life in Luxury, A Enough! and Prague vs. Prachy.
The prosecution refers to them as an organized group.
The police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from The Godfather.
It's more about the mafia - juniors, but they're organized.
Only in the fact that they are guarding each other's staffles (taxi stands).
Prague is completely fragmented.
I traced that, for example, the main railway station does not like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> (disco club)
Everyone just keeps an eye on their place, and each group is organized in some way.
This is a complex network.
The defendants, however, are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former city hall official, who warned the driver about the checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
What percentage of Prague taxi fraudsters do you estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst people on the street are still there.
I’m talking about, for example, Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Ryja<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at Charles Bridge and drives people.
The last time I drove with him, he was asking for $700 for three miles.
The police did not arrest him for some reason.
Only a few people from the whole big group were selected.
The same is true of other locations in Prague.
The indictment of seven people, therefore, is difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague nesvar, which apparently has much larger dimensions.
Of course, it is completely useless.
It will help, but all evil will not be eradicated, that is true.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still perform in the same places that you showed in the reports, i.e. at Charles Bridge or at Parizska Street?
Yes, that's right.
In these locations, they stand every day and break decrees every day.
It is ignored by both the city police and the Prague City Hall.
It's not even a cat anymore, it's total indifference.
The business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
However, some of them, even if only part of the group, will go to trial.
It's a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel like I need to get a little better, I will continue to do so.
You have to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still be doing something to get rid of him.
You can't settle for that.
But that is not the case, of course there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them right in the cabs?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week I caught a taxi driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was the amount of 56 crowns (he used a decimal point trick).
He had a receipt for it, the police came, and this taxi driver was so cutely impertinent that he still went to those policemen and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
A taxi driver glued a decimal point on the taximeter and robbed tourists of CZK 357.
Is it possible to say that the insolence of fraudulent taxi drivers did not subside even after you showed in your footage the faces of those who charged senseless amounts for a short trip?
Their insolence is still unbelievable.
How did it go with the taxi driver claiming 56 crowns?
The police sent him away, saying that they could not discuss it with him on the spot, because he had issued a receipt.
And I think that will be a problem in this court (six taxi drivers and one ex-official).
On one side there will be a taxi driver with his receipts, on the other side there will be the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the municipality is not allowed to use secret recordings from the taxi service as evidence in court.
When I was filming episodes about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves brought this precedent to my attention.
I've always wanted to use the footage for a reportage.
Are you afraid that this fact could protect them from a court of law?
I hope that every judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns per kilometer, because he would not make a living from it.
You were talking about a decimal point trick that underwater taxi drivers push in front of foreign clients.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they concerned about continuing to use this trick after your reports are published?
I think we popularized this trick by broadcasting the show on the contrary.
Recently I drove with a taxi driver, bragging in front of me that he is the honest taxi driver.
Then I noticed a black cardboard glued to the side of the taximeter.
When I asked him what he had in there, he said, "You know what it is."
If the fines didn’t work very well for the fraudulent taxi drivers, can the courts and their colleagues be a warning to them?
Is there anything that can stop them from cheating?
You talked about how you thought they'd always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can deter them.
But someone can squeeze them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague, fortunately, prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack a mind.
They can't walk very well and they can't say exactly what they want.
When they staged the demonstration (due to the proposal for a nationwide restriction coming from Mayor Adriana Krná<0xC4><0x8D>ová’s office), it was not very clear what they wanted.
They once said they weren’t protesting Uber, that they just wanted to be on the same terms as Uber, and then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they only blocked Prague and only the best possible advertisement for Uber was created from it.
How do you assess the approach of the Prague City Hall in solving the problem of fare overcharging?
It is obvious that only the criminal police had to step in to solve something.
The magistrate was too short.
They had a mole out there, which means that the taxi department had been doing its job for years in vain.
I hope they charge that clerk all the checks he's missed until the last check so he can see what he's done.
I think that's the worst part.
I even went with him on one of the check-ups, which I found out later from their schedule.
It has been a few months since the last episodes of the series were published.
What's the response?
I think especially of foreign viewers, which is what the series is most focused on.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play them the videos.
And then when we walk along the Old Town Square, they are surprised that the same people that are seen in the footage are really standing there.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
Seriously.
I'd put a fence around them so people could look at them.
The Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need it?
Sure, yeah.
I drive with services where I don’t have to pay cash, but by card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also a lot of dispatches that are fair.
I've only taken a taxi on the street once since.
When the driver got in the car, he said, "Well, you've got a lot of guts."
I am dressed as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were reported in 2005.
In the same year, the former mayor Pavel Bém went on a control ride disguised as an Italian tourist and at the first attempt, the driver cheated him by two hundred.
But the editor Rubesh had a worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him 820 crowns for the ride from Starom<0xC4><0x9B>stské to Wenceslas Square, which is about 195 crowns per kilometer, as calculated by the reporters.
The Prague City Hall has set the maximum price at CZK 28 per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the filmed report: for example, a two-kilometer journey from Pa<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>ská Street to Truhlá<0xC5><0x99>ská Street cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
For a ride to the Angel, which has 2.5 kilometers, they charge even six hundred crowns.
The marble is washed mainly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
Dirt from it goes well, although sometimes dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be cut out of the folds.
It’s not easy and it’s not fast, the restoration work of Vanesa Trostová from Old<0xC5><0x99>ichov in Háj.
Hat down in front of it: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, on which it is necessary to climb and climb again countless times.
"The restaurateur should be careful, patient and unpretentious to the working environment," she said.
This is not her first restoration work in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back of the Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant Town Hall were restored, as well as the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Záti<0xC5><0xA1>í, St. John of Nepomuk in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant, Piet in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlantská Okru<0xC5><0xBE>ní street, the Marian column in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant with Sn<0xC3><0xBD> and the atlanty.
The restoration of the tombstone of Melchior, Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tof and Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina z Redernu began in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from the deposit of dirt and crust, the loose stone parts are secured against falling and displacement; they will either be anchored to the wall or to each other.
There is also treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gilded again.
"Then it will start with the gilding of the inscriptions on the marble plates with pure slices of gold," said V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Sobotová, a representative of the State Heritage Office in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant.
There are no records from the past that the tombstone has undergone any repairs.
On closer inspection, the holes drilled in the marble columns will catch the eye.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of the decoration of the tombstone.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the invasion of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
The tombstone was literally painted, noted Saturday.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross there are restaurateurs with a slight exaggeration as at home.
After the flood of 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tombstones that were under water, the baptistery was restored, the wall paintings in the tomb and now the tombstone.
"We'd also like to get into stained glass in the future," said Sobota.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, we invest money in maintenance and repairs every year.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Redenn<0xC3><0xBD> tombstone will cost a total of CZK 128 000.
They will be covered by subsidies, the city will not invest any of its money in this part of the reconstruction.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from the winning in the regional round of the Historic City of 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said the mayor of Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant Dan Ramzer.
The House of Representatives decided to release the prize for the restoration of the tombstone.
Experts' opinions on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) in the horizon of one and a half months.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who would have thought of that at the beginning of the year?
The US S&P500 index, which underwent 12% corrections in February, is now at a new historical high and has already recorded 7% since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never, in the long run, go against the interests of central banks, which in the end have always achieved theirs.
At a time when U.S. stocks are at historic highs, volatility is disappearing again, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when the markets were happy and fearlessly growing thanks to the quantitative easing of the U.S. central bank, and when, as today, the Volatility Index (VIX) remained stable below the threshold of 12 percent.
And I don't want to.
While the Fed continues to prepare markets for gradual interest rate hikes, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England, which will buy <0xC2><0xA3>70bn in bonds over the next six months, joined in.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative easing pushes already low yields even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this state last?
Of course, this is a million-dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market and in China is stabilizing, and Brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we should not be too surprised if US stocks continue to endure in a similarly calm regime.
Too bad Juncker isn't studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult work, said Juncker, when he appointed the French politician (really experienced, because he has so many different transnational political functions that it would be difficult to find a better example of the so-called European elite) as the main negotiator of the European Commission for the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU.
Juncker’s choice has blown away signs of hope that it is in the EU’s serious interest to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most British media adopted Barnier's name as a Juncker War Act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
They hate the UK.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
He conceived it as only he could have conceived it: a stubborn enemy of the Anglo-Saxon conception of the free market and the model of capitalism.
A proponent of multilateral regulation, he co-authored the concept of the so-called banking union and, resentful of everything that originates from London’s City Financial Centre, enforced legislation excessively harsh regulation of the financial sector and services.
Thus, this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, unyielding and apparently ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, how not to remember the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak federation, to which the balance, overview and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus so much contributed?
Even today, Czechs and Slovaks can be close friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker from Václav Klaus - at least in this - did not learn.
It would be for the good of all!
Earthquakes around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin released his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday dismissed Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
This was reported by the Russian media, referring to the announcement of the press service of the Kremlin.
Putin has indicated that he is releasing Ivanova at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by Rossiya 24, the president said he was responding to Ivanov’s wish to serve as presidential office chief for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The news of the exchange at the head of the presidential administration, now led by Ivanov’s current deputy Vajno, is considered rather surprising.
Ivanov, 63, has been described as one of Putin’s closest associates.
This former KGB officer, for example, has served as Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister in the past.
He will now leave the chair of the president's security council.
Ivanov said in a meeting with Putin that the length of stay at the head of the administration of the head of state is actually a record.
It lasted four years and eight months.
In this regard, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already been replaced in this position.
Kvitova and Uncle Shafarova will not play the final.
So far, none of Friday's tennis matches have been able to turn into the finals.
Petra Kvitová was the first to lose her fight, succumbing to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after sets of 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, Kvitová was followed by Czech doubles players <0xC5><0xA0>afá<0xC5><0x99>ivá and Strycová.
The Williams sisters' slayers reached for the first set, but they lost two setballs and the Russians eventually seized the set in a shortened game.
They lost the second set 4-6.
Half of the success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skipper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Synek won his semifinals with an overview, when he defeated the second Damir Martin from Croatia despite a slowdown in the final by almost a second.
Today was good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said the son.
It was his opponents, unlike him, who had to fight for the procedure.
So it took some of their strength, so it could be easier tomorrow.
But I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, it’s just playing cards for me, said the rower of the Prague Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková, however, did not walk in Snyk's footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower took fourth place in the semifinals today and on Saturday she will start in the B final and fight for 7th to 12th place.
Gold from London won't do that.
This was the first time I didn’t make it to the finals at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I did a good race and I put everything I could into it.
The opponents were simply better, Topinkova Knapkova bowed before them.
She fought to the end, believing that she would be among the elite six in her fourth games.
He gave up the fight just before the goal.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone could advance out of the field.
I was surprised that the Chinese had such a finish.
And I thought I could make it to the final through the Austrian.
“Unfortunately, today was the race of my life,” said the 2011 world champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained a young scorer Filip Nepejchal, who even for the second time failed to break through from qualifying, this time a small squad in the lay.
It did not occupy the 33rd place.
The Russians were the best qualified.
Sergey Kamensky advanced from the first place with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigoryan (628.9).
Nepeychal's shot was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke for the first time on the program in Rio, among them the Czech heptathletes Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachová and Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inová.
Cache belongs to the second discipline of the Olympic competition eleventh place, Czech record holder Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inová is twenty-two.
British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, as well as the second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
They both achieved the best altitude performance ever in a seven-game.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters but failed.
The German, the Russian, who's worse?
Aside from the absurdity of the question thus posed: German society has undergone deep self-reflection, while Russian society has not.
In the two great Eurasian nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century, and regimes came to power that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible.
The Russian Bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism cited in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare, or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumanly exterminated about 6 million Jews, and the total casualties of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
Germans and Soviets carried out atrocities in occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany and the USSR, not just a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively or simply by cowardice or sticking their heads in the sand.
This is not only the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are equally guilty.
In Germany, the denazification, the Nuremberg Tribunal, came to an immediate end.
But the most important came later.
As the children grew up, they began to ask, “Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?”
How could you!
This has brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly do not want to rejoin Alsace-Lorraine or to retaliate - to attack militarily - perhaps everyone recognizes that.
After the loss of the Cold War in Russia, there was no major reflection.
The window of possible positive changes finally closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB officer (sic!)Vladimir Putin came to power.
The criminal past is often celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin's Russia is revenge, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity and the future of one’s own people are of no value to the upper class.
Beat yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only in the decades of the despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - predestined to Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from rising tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimean region has deteriorated.
Who benefits from rising tensions?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia have deteriorated again.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side was the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from the two opposing sides contradict each other and it is difficult to independently verify them, so we have only the opportunity to think about an old well-known question to whom it benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there were terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
On the information about the arrest of Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia came from the case of the pilot Savchenko known answer that they were allegedly kidnapped on the territory of Russia.
If we were to adopt the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further strengthening of sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, against the background of the immigration crisis in Europe, there has been a retreat of attention from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost credit in front of its citizens, when the current support for President Poroshenko is around 15%.
Ukraine’s economy would have been bankrupt a long time ago had it not been for the generous financial injections by the EU and, above all, by the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw strong attention to its country once again in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the force leadership want to show themselves again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It remains to be hoped that all those who are trying to unleash an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only the soldiers, but of all ordinary people on both sides of the war, and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria reported inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest level in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero level since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI, for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 vs. December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 vs. July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in travel for the following consumer goods groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
The U.S. Secret Service has been tracking Russian hacking for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to light last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was investigating an attack on the servers of the party’s Democratic headquarters.
There is no official mention of Russia’s involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied any involvement in the attack.
The report on the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top-secret, because its disclosure would reveal that the US intelligence services are monitoring the hacking attack and could reveal the way they are doing it and the resources they are using.
Two Russian intelligence agencies were involved in the attack.
New Advisory Board on Cybersecurity
The Russian tracking material was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called the gang of eight in the United States, was informed.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the chairmen of the Democrats in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the Congressional Defense and Security Committees.
On Thursday, Democratic leader Donna Brasile said she was setting up a cybersecurity advisory board to “prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection for the Democratic Party’s servers.”
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon from Alberta.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's suggestion for health problems after eating the food Wild smoked salmon - pieces of 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016 Prague hygienists carried out a check in the stores Albert on Wenceslas Square and Na M<0xC5><0xAF>stku.
The inspection found that the batch L23012562/T4 with the expiry date 22.11.2016, which the customer pointed out, is no longer available, and therefore the product of the same batch with the expiry date 11.12.2016 was removed.
Laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
This is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a powerful allergen and human-eaten live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, Sticha said.
We apologise to our customers for any problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the batch from sale and for preventive reasons we also withdrew all other batches of this item.
There was a mistake on the part of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, Alberta Barbora Vanko, a spokeswoman, told the newspaper.
If the customer has purchased this product, he can return it in any of the stores of the chain and receive a refund.
Larvae destroy frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vr<0xC5><0x88>ata.
The Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration were informed about the occurrence of the dangerous product.
According to the server bezpe<0xC4><0x8D>nostpotravin.cz, people after eating the parasite can become sick with anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can proceed asymptomatically.
Symptoms occur one to two weeks after eating insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to high and low temperatures, so they are killed either with sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or when it is frozen.
Veterinarians have now checked the salmon with the recipient of the imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples tested contained parasites.
The shipment of 1700 products arrived in the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Dispatched, in the vast majority to the Ahold chain, there have been 919 packages to date.
The unsold stock of the product is currently being withdrawn from stores, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal told <0xC4><0x8C>TK on Friday.
Immediately after finding positive samples, veterinarians banned sending other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old Briton tried to flee Raqqa after being killed by a Russian airstrike.
After initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to a jihadist who was soon killed, sobriety came.
The expected paradise of the caliphate has turned for the British girls into a hell on earth from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She had repeatedly called her to Britain and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have been ordered to shoot without hesitation, the Telegraph quoted the lawyer of the deceased girl’s family, Tasnima Akunjee, as saying.
The last traces led to Raqqa, from where the girl last spoke.
Then came the news of her death, which could not be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
They hoped to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was likely killed before she could escape because the house she was staying in was razed to the ground by an airstrike in May, British ITV News reported.
The TV station added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that attacked an ISIS bastion in Syria.
You would take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of the dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week Kadiza was thinking about fleeing Islamic State territory, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to available information, was publicly beaten to death.
I think she interpreted [Kadiza] as a warning and decided not to take any risks, according to BBC Akunjee.
A family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old schoolmates Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, set off on February 17 last year.
At home, they just said they were going out.
They headed to and from Gatwick Airport via Turkey to IS-controlled territory.
According to the lawyer, the girl's family did everything in their power to get Kadiza back.
You'd take blues out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family has done everything they can to get their daughter home.
But this was not possible without risking being caught, the lawyer added.
The only positive thing is that Kadiza’s fate can serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
“There are many cases where people went there, they realized how things were there, they understood how far it differed from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and they wanted to return,” Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiza's classmates is unknown.
But as they have also paused, their families must come to terms with the fact that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, Inveraray was the county centre and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
From the middle of the 18th century, courts were held in the town hall, and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the prisoners were incarcerated were pitiful, and many prisoners attempted to escape.
Many of them successfully.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
It was not in operation for a long time anyway, its closure took place for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, as smaller correctional facilities were expensive to operate and did not pay much.
Stories of convicts and ghost hunting.
The prison opened to the public a century later, and visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different the conditions were.
Guides in period costumes add to the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked in one of the cells, usually for a photo as a souvenir, or to make a sense of what prisoners are experiencing behind bars.
Inveraray Prison is one of Scotland’s most famous haunted areas.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have already gone there, and to this day the museum allows people to come hunting ghosts.
Such a night, however, will cost <0xC2><0xA3>300, which is about CZK 9,500.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
Snapchat’s ‘Anime’ Effect Criticized as an Asian Cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Every day, the Snapchat app allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identity in ways that border on absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that looks like it came out of a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any errors will be reported immediately.
Snapchat’s filters have received criticism in the past, with accusations that the app promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered users this week a filter that made them have slanted eyes, crooked teeth, and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated contentious questions did not point to a larger problem of society - the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and outrage quickly spread, and Snapchat said the next day that it had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a display of accounts to anime characters, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded of painful stereotypes in action.
Others uncovered the comparison with the anime rejected.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it’s hard to argue against comparing the apparent Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is drawn to a contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diversified than their older partners — can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
“When a single Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some user,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday, “it’s very difficult to ignore these things today, as it used to be.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes racially motivated issues reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat recruitment.
Katie Zhu criticized the company’s predominantly white, all-male leadership, ending the article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they don’t have any diversity among employees and colored people at the time these things are decided,” said Zhu, who is of Sino-American descent, “or colored people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak up.”
Other observers share her view, a complaint Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees, with the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter who should focus on underrepresented populations and internal inclusion management.
Zhu adds, “I wonder if they really need more users who can say it’s not right,” with their account remaining closed.
Army officers misrepresent intelligence about IS, says parliamentary committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report released on Thursday that officers at the U.S. Central Command were altering intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events provided from the country.
According to a preliminary report by a working group compiled by the Republican chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense, there was “extensive dissatisfaction” among Central Intelligence analysts, according to which their superiors were altering their assessment of the US effort to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
In a press release to the report, it said: “Reports by intelligence agencies approved by senior Centcom officers usually offered a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than confirmed by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.”
“What happened at Centcom is unacceptable – our fighters are harmed when an erroneous analysis is presented to superior policymakers,” said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
The failure of Centcom’s leadership reaches to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the central staff’s ongoing challenges in describing and analyzing U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While no conclusive evidence is offered that top Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be amended, the report said analysts felt they were being pressured by Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the danger posed by ISIS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the central staff’s press releases, statements and statements from Congress were substantially more positive than what actually happened,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack to take Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“This is quite clear after months of investigation,” said Mike Pompeo, a Kansas-based Republican MP.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top intelligence officials at the U.S. Central Staff manipulated the staff’s intelligence outputs to minimize the dangers of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a working group after learning of analysts’ concerns that intelligence-related information about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, released on Thursday, must be followed by a further investigation.
Centcom’s intelligence services are still being investigated by the Department of Defense’s Inspector General.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which matched some of the Republican working group's findings.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom set up a very narrow process for compiling assessments of information on IS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the committee and Democrat representative.
According to Adam Schiff, the process “has led to distorting intelligence outputs,” damaging the morality among analysts, and “insufficiently taking into account dissenting views.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House is trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to “patterns or political situations.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon’s inspector general, which was launched following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander-Lieutenant Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report as the Inspector General’s investigation was still ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these crucial national security issues."
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (a statement now claimed by a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year’s allegations raised questions about how much President Obama can count on the Central Staff to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other places of crisis.
Criticism of intelligence about the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that President George W. Bush's administration - despite the objections of many analysts - was advocating a small unit in Iraq and was devoting little time to it in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the resistance against the Islamic State’s intelligence services.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker’s team had concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group’s financial resources, as the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been handed over outside the central headquarters.
The commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism for the past year after many lawmakers found the Senate's testimony to be too positive of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. won the fourth straight game of hockey on the ground, so today will be a decisive match in the team of Great Britain
Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6-1 win against Japan and just a day later scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's ice hockey team in a game in which America defeated India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever managed to do so.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who writes down their goals.
But he knows this: Americans in the Olympic tournament lead to the matches 4:0 and share the first place in the group with the United Kingdom, which remained unbeaten on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
Britain and the United States will face each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will decide who of the group of six teams finishes in first place and who in second place.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes, who are at the head of the second group, for a little longer.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday’s match, the Americans made a startling stir, four years after finishing among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took a hockey rod for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make it to the finals.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team were doing very well.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn’t have the pace of work in London that we have today.
We made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam started in the first half by scoring the goal with a backend from close range.
India entered the match without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam seized the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then scrambled into the center and scored the ball into the goal to get the Americans in the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the fourth quarter.
The elimination of American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who helped to one goal in each of the three victories, was the first in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's match.
Zen trampolines in the middle of Olympic rage
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro can be felt as a persistent, indescribable and biased alternation of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a hot relay pin handed from a archer to a swimmer, a gymnast, and a triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in a queue at a cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming lover of women with holes in their cheeks, is at the Olympics for the first time, and could also be among those whose names sound in households at the main broadcast time between the commercials and sponsor spots, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
The Olympic flame doesn't shine the same in all competitions.
Away from the middle, a little in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and will probably reign for a long time.
But if I may name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw your attention to the inconspicuous charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first featured at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of interventions, the sport remains almost unnoticed – many of the people I interviewed didn’t even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. has never won a trampoline jumping medal, and none of the athletes made it to the finals until 2012.
Prizes in the men's category are usually divided between China and Russia, and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will include Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
Trampoline jumps have another bad luck, partly because the uninitiated ear will seem more suitable for a clown university than for the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, just a country-watching enthusiast.
It has comic potential - comic vibrations of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline", which means "jumping board."
The aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them to a height of up to almost 10 meters and showcase assemblies with several elements (salta, bolts and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to performance, difficulty and "age in the air".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
Fighters for the gold medal must go further, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
It is trying to catch up not only with the finish line or the starting wall, but, as TV news reports, also another imaginary line: the world record or the Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical — and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also a bit exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Trampoline jumps in this regard bring relief.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she bounces off as if they were in a weightless state like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, even difficulty, it is impossible, but for the duration of the line-up there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no measurement of distance, but only perfect, graceful stretching of time and gravity.
This is the closest the Olympics and Zen will ever come.
The women's qualifying and finals are held on Friday afternoon at 1 p.m. Eastern Time, and the men's competition is held on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of the afternoon block, which starts at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that you will probably overlook in spite of other duels.
And if attention is only to be gained by making male athletes the subject of love-seeking and materialization — as the US gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal — then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch their breath.
“Protesting Generations” in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during clashes with police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, the country has been plagued by anti-government unrest, which is spreading to more and more areas.
Over the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was ruthless.
Witnesses say police shot and killed crowds of unarmed demonstrators.
Circling video footage of the protests, likely from the end of last year or early this year, shows security forces beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand against a wall.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It’s always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, Horn of Africa project leader for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the region, especially in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, are receiving such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy was developing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is even a new suburban train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - human rights organizations are constantly talking about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many were expelled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
However, that may change.
“When you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, they break through,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
A whole generation has been protesting.
The complaints are many and relate to everything from land disputes to absolute control over the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year’s election, which has been widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies have won the last seat held by the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing, and the conflict along this imprecisely marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anylits fear that separatist groups that have been more or less repressed over the past years, such as the Oromian Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and rearm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of smoking under the surface, these bitter feelings have reignited.
The first is seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social networks only in the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonplace and the provision of Internet services has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they were gathering for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oroms and the Amhars, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amharic peoples, mostly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade, and exploited the Oroms, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
"We are on the way to a united leadership," Mulatu Gemech, the leader of the Oroms, said.
The largest protests took place in areas inhabited by Amhara and Orom.
Many Amharic and Oromo believe that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnicity, who make up about 6% of the population and control the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former leader of the rebels, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an unspecified illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly skilled at detecting early signs of dissatisfaction and using envoys to process and win opponents to his side.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative obscurity in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in Tigris-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be further bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts described as elections that the government blew and then stole.
A tough crackdown followed, during which many protesters were killed - albeit less than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual growth of disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped this.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked Tigris-owned businesses, and resentment against Tigris on social media is becoming more common.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a drone base for overflights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently said the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, at the same time it does not want its ally to fall apart in an already volatile area.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump Explains His Statement About Obama and ISIS Financing as ‘Sarcasm’
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to downplay the latest controversy that floods his campaign, saying he didn’t mean it seriously when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
He also embarrasses his supporters, who have worked diligently to defend him in turbulent times, and he has to explain that he may not have taken his remarks seriously.
Following this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he did not really intend to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
But in a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of what Trump said just one day ago, when he said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump ease the remark by reminding him that Obama was seeking to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not respond.
The latest storm comes as Trump tries to focus his campaign’s attention on the economy while his preferences in election polls decline.
Trump and Clinton took part in an economic duel in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to revisit the issue.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton’s proposals were linked to tax hikes, saying her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he picked up a wave of criticism, when he made a suggestion that the Russians should penetrate Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remark with the words: “Of course I am sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and soften them as necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing the extent to which some messages have a response from his supporters to see how they respond, and then, based on the response, one way or the other, ‘give an explanation,’” said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who tracked the language both candidates used.
But I also think that he is deft in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be explained differently.
As the results of the election polls in his favor continue to decline, Trump has chosen an even more stingy tone in recent days, rather than softening things up for the general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, published on Friday, showed Tump is far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative remarks, but often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or failing to understand his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces heightened scrutiny in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters, who must publicly stand by him, no matter how provocative his remarks, into an awkward position.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is a legitimate political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that he mistakenly called a rookie, and it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to thrive and failed to handle the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Ahead of Friday’s rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to blaze fire on the media around him on Twitter for shredding his every word and bias against him.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” television scientists who were trying to understand him and said, “They can’t!”
Several Democrats scoffed at Trump’s apology, saying it was just another proof he was not fit for the presidency.
The coffee shop has been pushed out of the price market and is now returning to Greenpoint.
Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is looted, and the Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, then it is also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original cafe, who is also the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, 36, left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even used the old Verbo lights again.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
Sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings such as capers and fried onions are on offer.
You will also find bowls of brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of natives.
"A number of original customers have also had to move out of Williamsburg due to prices," he said.
Last Sunday there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveir.
Ms. Oliveir, 34, lived in Williamsburg and frequented the Verb Cafe.
It happened even after the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee altogether for a while.
"I've found that what I like is coffee and culture in Verbo," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, but that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she took mixed chai, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been a devoted visitor to Verb since 2003.
He goes to work and always orders the same thing.
"At four and a half o'clock every day, I come here like a clock, and they're making me a bun with everything and butter," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually orders, but occasionally lets him have bacon, eggs and ham on his bread with everything.
Rodriguez said he was not sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
Also, the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint welcomed the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors would feel at home here.
The new place has other advantages.
A local fruit juice maker wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is an option to expand the café to a neighboring building.
Many customers just need to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop reopens, coming in and having a cup of coffee is like coming home.
"I miss the smell," he said.
Depressed food from the time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and ate lunch.
President Roosevelt, the gourmet, enjoyed a selection of 5th Avenue dishes, such as goose buns and Maryland tortoise soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: diabolical eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and plum pudding as dessert.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, focuses on gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe’s last book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane, in her book, 97 Orchard, tells the life story of a house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new collaborative work "A Square Meal", which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They themselves showed cooking solidarity and met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg’s sandwich shop, a small, sprawling buffet in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew, 57, ate turkey, mashed potatoes, and stirred vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which the couple said was perfect for talking about food during the crisis.
"The meatballs were very popular," said Miss Ziegelman.
Peanut, liver and bean meatballs were sold.
They were made from that admixture and other cheap foods that set the ingredient.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grinned.
"They'd be like lead in your stomach," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for the farm workers, and freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. “A Square Meal” tracks how the nation dealt with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods, such as meatballs and casseroles, casseroles as “an amazing way to use the leftovers,” Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide unsightly ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for many years the focal point of American food - has become a cost-effectively allocated luxury.
The strange mixtures, which were supposed to serve as a calorie and nutritional filling, had priority over taste or even common sense when cooking.
During research for a book that contains recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a time-honored dish of roasted onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a favorite addition to the dinner table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman said, “It was surreal.”
Peanut butter and roasted onions do not go together.
It was typical of a lot of homemade recipes.
As never before and never since, domestic economists—among them Louise Stanley, sheriff of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943—managed the country’s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraged women to take the reins of the budget, and turned things like creamy spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
First of all, desserts were created in response of the government to its hungry citizens, such as the pose of President Herbert Hoover "I'll have a cake".
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farming cuisine of his childhood, he ate like the chosen millionaire he became.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He was eating in an almost dressed room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn’t made him take an example with his own stomach.
As the book relates, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in taste at all. This led to the White House being “not only served almost the hottest meal in all of Washington, but also the most disappointingly prepared.”
Many of the eating habits of the crisis disappeared as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The link has remained in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they better understood Ms. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits – for example, why she couldn’t throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "It made people sick."
There was an accident with wreaths.
When Eisenberg's tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe took out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Reluctantly, everyone stuck the spoon into a thick brown mass.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a proper landlord, he said to his wife, "A little chopped weasel would be useful."
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most of the refugees coming to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what a series would look like if we were doing it.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us is making fun of their native country.
With the help of photoshop, he creates collages that humorously show what it would look like if famous series and films were shot in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to legal representation in the case of a patent against type C jaundice against Merck
A district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of lawyers' fees incurred in the anti-jaundice C patent proceedings against drug maker Merck & Co Inc.
In June, a judge overturned a ruling that Gilead had to pay $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents in connection with Gilead’s highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a federal judge found repeated illegal behavior on Merck’s part, including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal judge Beth Labson Freeman said in the file on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to a waiver of fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the next generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to own basic laboratory research on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead drugs.
U.S.-backed troops claim to have gained full control of Manbij
U.S.-backed troops have gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now scouring the city after the departure of the rest of the group of radicals who have been hiding in the city.
The troops freed more than 2,000 civilians detained by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij military council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, stating that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an actual tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Ex-President Bill Clinton contributed almost $5.3 million in lecture fees to the coffers, and the former Secretary of State granted $3 million in income from his Simon & Schuster publishing house for his book.
Clinton's co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published 10-year tax returns.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency,” Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign, said in a statement.
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and retreating from his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns even if the law does not require them to do so.
Trump, a New York-based businessman, and his lawyers cited a U.S. Treasury Department audit as a reason for his refusal to publish tax returns.
“Your move,” Hillary Clinton’s campaign aide said on Twitter, following the Democratic nominee’s tax returns.
Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish tax returns until the audits were completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican party members, agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profit, charitable contributions, business transactions and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has spoken out strongly on the issue and released a video on Friday reminding how high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, he will address the issue in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
“She refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades — to publish her tax returns,” she said.
Politico said Trump had paid no or very low taxes over the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times columnist quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants as saying this could still be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the presidential election.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would ensure that anyone earning more than $1 million a year pays at least 30 percent tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, Buffett called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been audited by the IRS and that Trump was “not afraid” of the tax office, but of voters.
Clinton’s campaign published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, their income is only $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported income on dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
In Tanzania, conservationists use an unorthodox method to prevent elephants from entering human dwellings by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania on how to use this non-violent four-step procedure to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they developed this ... toolkit, we have seen a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” Honeyguide Foundation Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first and second steps are to light a flashlight on the passing elephant and start the horn.
If this does not deter it, the so-called “chili cloud” will be ejected.
Chili powder mixed with salt is wrapped in a condom with a firecracker, its end is knotted so that only a wick looks out of it.
After firing, the condom explodes and a fine chili powder is dispersed into the air.
Usually one breath is enough and the elephant goes in the other direction.
The last option is to fire fireworks, which will cause a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish director leaned against Berlin hotel for removing code for calling to Israel at 'request' of Arabs - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin caused a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to an employee based on an “request” by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary “Shoah”, ventilated his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to locate Israel in the hotel's code list.
However, the state was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and erased?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling to Israel through its own call center.
The director sought an explanation and addressed the problem at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann’s response was “shocking,” he said.
A hotel official responded that the measure was “decided at the discretion of the management of Kempinski Hotels.”
The reason for this move further annoyed the director.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they have demanded that Israel’s dialing code be deleted,” Lanzmann said in a letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a “great embarrassment.”
We were horrified and shocked by the event.
It is a huge disgrace in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The incident sparked a strong online reaction, with people describing it as scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
“Shame on you,” another post reads, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street, is located near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel newspaper, the hotel quickly dismissed any accusations by calling the incident a “oversight” and apologizing to Lanzman.
"There has never been a direct order" to exclude Israel from the code list, a Kempinski hotel official told Suddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber projectiles against Brazilian students
A clash between students and police took place in São Paulo on Thursday, when students gathered to protest government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement tried to disperse students, ending with police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the governor of the state of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin in order to save money is also the closure of almost a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying inscriptions on the wall against interim president Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets in support of deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate decided to indict her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran, the trade turnover grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached $ 856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The surge in trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of tourists from Iran to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly travel visas.
For the first time, Iran ranked among the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be surpassed," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visited by a relatively small number of Russians. The ambassador hopes that there will be a change.
"Personally, I can recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Scottish man Callum Skinner rushes home after British win gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome, when the trio of the UK team defended the 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of the brake that Sir Chris Hoy took for his Scotsman, and the young man delighted the legend when he rushed to the finish line and stole the victory from the hands of favored New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing modestly sixth at the World Rail Cycling Championships in March, even though Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of specialized entry-level racer Jamie Staff.
So Hindes showed up just in time.
After Hoye's departure, a seat was also vacated, which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to fill.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was champion with Hoy four years ago - and with Skinner achieved an Olympic record in qualifying, but took over the jersey in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, as Hindes drove to a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partially Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes stepped onto the podium, he kept his eyes on them.
23-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to make the best of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After winning alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
The note was later withdrawn and Britain's rivals had no opportunity to appeal.
This time around, there was no such problem.
Hindes said, "With all the British flags on the stands, I felt like I was in London."
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We have lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for the nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then five successful days await us at the Velodrome.
With the form that Kenny has shown, it is not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
That would mean a total of six gold and one silver medals for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also has his birthday on March 23 (this date seems sacred to British sport, on this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - for Kenny.
As much as Hoy got.
Next, Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and lasts another three days.
A 28-year-old native of Bolton said, “I’m enjoying this one now.
A team race is always the best.
You win along with the others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal race of the day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the four-kilometre team chase.
They ended with a time of 3:51,943.
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (22:42) take place on today's second day of the race, which Wiggins will surely focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioners when the referees asked him to measure the height.
Laura Trotto, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set the world record with a time of 4:13,260.
The UK team relied on its strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-season Olympics and win many medals.
After a truly exceptional performance, demonstrating absolute supremacy in Beijing and London, expectations declined during preparations for Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, not least the resignation of CTO Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the careers of greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of races at the velodrome, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Uncertain future of Portland smelter after termination of power supply contract
The future of Portland's aluminum smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies the company with electricity and which informed about the intention of one of the owners of the smelter to terminate the contract for the supply of electricity. All contracts for the supply of electricity are expected to be shortened.
The move comes after the Victorian state government earlier this year decided not to extend the grants that keep the company running.
The 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2,000 jobs – direct or indirect – may be at risk.
And because the smelter consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, other avalanche impacts may occur.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's smelter in Portland is in danger of closing.
The move follows years of speculation about the company’s future, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the factory’s production prices.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with small business shares held by Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that demand for electricity from the smelter will continue,” she said.
The AGL said the contracts were so-called “reinsurance contracts” that were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
“AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profits for the fiscal year 2017,” the plant said.
Any possible impact on AGL profits from fiscal year 2018 onwards is currently limited due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL said it had already written down the value of contracts under its books of $187 million “in case of termination.”
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contract “has no impact on its ... ability to operate the smelter or secure the power supply to the smelter.”
The company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to start in November, although it still has to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the industry.
AGL operations manager Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would imply a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
It wouldn’t be good for us as a producer,” he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the real estate TV show Kardashian - now he is the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and fourth daughter of the clan’s mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the cover of the September issue of American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, brand ambassador Estee Lauder, who performed at the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, I feel like crying when I look at this front page,” Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of the clashes in the performance of the Kardashians?) staged video in which the entire Kardashians-Jenner family (bar rioters Rob and Caitly, along with their favorite uncle from show business, producer Keeping Up with Ryan Seacrest) was staged.
It’s a twisted storyline of almost every “birthday” episode of a children’s TV show (Seacrest says, “Did you think we forgot about you?” with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o’clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to make sure other girls could feed themselves at this publicity.
Because if we look at the September issue of Vogue, we’ve definitely entered a new era for the Kardashians.
Kim's older sister may have pushed the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
The publication, which is more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist calculated that out of 832 pages in last year’s edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star, which will appear on the front page, is eagerly awaited, so it is not surprising that in the past two years, images of the magazine leaked before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, more “celebrities who make models” have appeared on the front page than “celebrity models.”
Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar-winning and Dior brand ambassador, appeared on the title page in 2013, a year later she was honored by Lagy Gaga.
But even though it’s highly unlikely that Kendall – whom the magazine describes as a “breakthrough model” of her generation – will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities aren’t relatives of famous people, real estate show stars, or kids today who know how to make a well-written video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are proven to be talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who made the front page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is thrilled with Jenner’s success.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult due to her participation in reality shows.
Stephanie Seymour, Victoria's Secret's original model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June, calling them "the sluts of the moment."
These feelings were rekindled with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not appropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
He's performing for Mark Jacobs.
Sells you make-up by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She's selling photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she's on a reality show, maybe just one way to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community Legal Aid Centers Reject 160,000 People a Year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in community legal aid centres, and the sector itself is preparing for impacts that will have further funding constraints on already over-expensive services.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people without the financial means to fight unfair eviction and the like – are already rejected when they seek free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so strained to burst, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funds.
James Farrell, director of Queensland’s Community Legal Aid Centers, said the latest report by the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers found that 5,000 people are rejected each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without a revocation of the federal government's decision, the situation would deteriorate.
“Community legal aid centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with a rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems with the legal dimension, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leading to thousands more at risk from Queensland having to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We call on Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to stop these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government of the state has fulfilled its commitment to ensure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community centers of legal assistance and the community of their clients, and Palaszczuk’s government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign lawsuit after staff member allegedly pointed a gun
NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump’s campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after they were told that the North Carolina Chief of Operations pointed a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court file handed over to the Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software campaign trainer in the state, on Wednesday.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before concluding that "it will not happen".
Director Earl Phillip “pointed his fingers at the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pointed the barrel at Vincent’s knee,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
According to the file, Bordini found out after complaining to the local and regional campaign management that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Weapons don't have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a stir when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and holders (which is regulated in the U.S. by the Second Amendment of the Constitution) could intervene if his rival, Hillary Clinton, is elected and can appoint her judges.
Trump’s campaign says the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent oversight and from Phillip for endangerment of personal safety, unlawful use of violence and infliction of emotional harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news outlet in Charlotte, said Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, was not answered within a short period of time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of recovery and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just as London was in 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympics have brought huge benefits to both Startford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We will create 10,000 new teaching jobs, 40,000 new jobs for our local communities and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, there will be those who will think that the Heathrow expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would make fun of ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out that they were wrong.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in economic growth, and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented an <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and on a budget, starting with Terminal T5 – which has been voted the best terminal in the world for five years in a row, to Terminal T2, which was built among the two busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third runway worth <0xC2><0xA3>16bn of private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a huge success for the UK, and I’m confident that the Heathrow expansion will be one too.
It is time to further spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure trade for the future, and leave a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy for Business Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game of cat and mouse in ad blocking
Attempts to circumvent ad-blocking programs have turned into a game of cat and mouse for companies that make money from online marketing, at least that’s what one of the companies that program such software claims.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site stating that users can update filters in their program and block ads on the social network again.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop websites will change the encoding around ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to find out which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now says the new codes have already been bypassed.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the open source ad blocking community and those trying to bypass it has been going on ever since ad blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another self-fix.
The fact that the company owning the world’s largest social network has become involved in the war only proves how much of a problem ad blocking for industry has become.
According to a study conducted by Pagefair last year, Adobe is using ad filters around 200 million people worldwide – almost four times as many as in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook ad revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook every day from mobile devices.
A spokesperson said the company is going against desktop ad filters because mobile ad filters for social media and Instagram mobile apps don’t work.
Advertisements on desktops still generate profits high enough that Facebook decided to invest in them.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update its ad preferences tool to give people better control over how ads are shown to them.
Facebook said on Thursday it was concerned about the new Adblock filters because they could also block content on sites that is not related to ads.
“This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Ad blocking is an insensitive tool, so we’d rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences to give people control.
Woman hit by car on Swiss highway
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an incident in which a woman, presumably trying to commit suicide, was driven over the highway in the early hours of Thursday.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the actress was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman aged 49, tried to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but according to police, not all have yet been identified. Police are urging these drivers and all others who witnessed the accident to report.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genève.
It is still necessary to find out whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Could the impact have been prevented?
That's what the prosecutor needs to find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases over the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be held liable.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on a highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent death charges after hitting and killing a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking alcohol and had fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was driving in a reasonable manner and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident at Morges should report to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a favorite destination of the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (A<0xC4><0x8C>KA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
This was announced on Friday by the Executive Director of A<0xC4><0x8C>CKA Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Pet<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival brings closer the life of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.
Last year, about 35,000 people took part in the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community for its high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses," Pet<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ková said.
According to the organizers’ survey, foreign visitors spend an average of CZK 3,100 per person per day.
Special maps of Prague with a complete list of gay and gay-friendly Prague bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc. are available for gay tourists to support their travel.
"In general, for tourism, LGBT people are very lucrative, are interested in stays at higher prices with a high standard of travel services and spend more than others," Pet<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held this year as part of the festival programme.
It is lectured by LGBT tourism experts from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, which are family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival on Saturday will be a traditional procession with allegorical wagons, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letná.
The parade, attended by thousands of people in recent years, will this year mark a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat are celebrating their 40th anniversary.
The irresistible craftsmen Pat and Mat, whose quest usually ends in disaster, have entertained small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening series directed by Lubomír Bene<0xC5><0xA1> premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, were cartoon jokes of the artist and director Lubomír Bene<0xC5><0xA1>, which he invented for the magazine with two DIYers Mr. Ouholí<0xC4><0x8D>ek and Sedlec.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> then invited the playwright Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Kubí<0xC4><0x8D>ek and the artist Vladimír Jiránek to collaborate and together they created the film Ku<0xC5><0xA5>áci.
Today's appearance with a yellow and red t-shirt and a kulich and a radio show was given to the characters in 1979, when the series for Slovak Television began to be created in the Short Film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then given to the DIYers in 1985, this time it was shot directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Bene<0xC5><0xA1> founded his own animated film studio AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of them involving Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s son Marek.
Nowadays there are over ninety episodes with the stories of these craftsmen, which all fall under their hands, but they are never angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and in the end they are satisfied with their work, which is evidenced by the familiar gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theater, and characters or other toys depicting Pat and Mat are the hit of every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two-year Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sports and one from life.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
What are the things people spend the most on at airports?
This is Friday's review from the world's websites.
The first medal from the Olympic Games.
Historical success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
The rugby selection of this archipelago defeated the British team in the final of the Olympic tournament of seven-point rugby.
This is the first medal that Fiji won at the Olympics.
Waiting for the first precious metal to be mined took sixty years after sending the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
A great credit for the success of the coach bears Fiji.
Ironically, it was Ben Ryan.
He has led the team since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen could be satisfied, unlike his compatriots.
"Let's play freely and lightly and see if we can make it to the biggest game in our history," he said.
Fiji eventually came to dominate it, and the small state of 900,000 people is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The news was reported by the French newspaper Le Monde.
A new friend and luck for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living for 11 months without arms and legs, has a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old said, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her hands and feet and then sit together without prosthetics.
Harmonia was diagnosed with meningitis type B in less than a year of life, with doctors giving her only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny and she never gives up.
He's got a view.
I saw her introduce herself to the other children with the words Hello, I am Harmony and I have no hands, added the mother.
Look at the joy the doll caused.
What do we spend the most on at the airport?
CNN reports that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
Hudson’s travel essential stores has released data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products that customers buy most frequently at its airport stores.
Water was the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, eight of them were placed in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large package of M&M candies with coconut flavour.
Can you guess who is in the top 10?
As one of the above things can not be eaten.
According to CNN, this is The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: The New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
The magazines include US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing Sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
New Zealand rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have ruled the two-man category for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the dissimilar pair switched to a smaller crew after the Olympics in Beijing and have been crushing competition since 2009.
At the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, they scored their 69th straight win in the final on Thursday.
How are we different from the others?
“We’re just prettier,” Murray joked during the Olympic regatta, when he was supposed to answer questions about the New Zealand couple’s dominance.
Honestly, we don’t do anything different than the others.
We train hard, very hard.
And we are constantly trying to improve our technique, that is our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two meters tall and a hundred kilos, academically-looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
They also have a different nature.
Bond studies and finances, Murray has been involved in charity boxing.
That's why they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's getting on the boat basically saying we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what could go wrong, Bond admitted, who also demonstrated at a press conference that Murray is the dominant in the crew.
He was always the first to answer, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
On the water, however, destroys the opponent with calm force.
They are moving at their own pace, and although they are often not in the lead in the middle of the track, their opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We are racing on a two-kilometre track and we never wanted to drive the first kilometre upwards.
We're just trying to go at a pace that no one else can.
"We know what we have to do to win," Murray said.
With his four years younger partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both members of the Golden Four were without a helmsman.
It was after the unexpected failure of a larger crew at the Olympics in Beijing a year later that they decided to switch to number two without a helmsman.
At the Olympics in London, probably the biggest loss of their careers were compensated and the dominance was confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
“We did everything the coach told us to do and they didn’t ask.
This time it was a little more fun.
“We knew it was going to be bloody hard, and we had to make sure we were doing well mentally,” Murray said.
We know they all want to overthrow us.
We still have the target on our backs.
But we are trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for studying Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, waterless and saturated with CO2, could once have had conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rotation speed of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, it seems that Venus could once boast a thin Earth-like atmosphere while rotating slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet probably had areas drier than Earth, but it once had enough water and geographic diversity to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the sun, which was 30 percent subdued.
“In a simulation of the GISS model, Venus during its slow rotation exposes its daily side to the sun for almost two months at a time,” explains GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This is how the surface heats up and rain forms, creating a dense layer of clouds that act like an umbrella and protect the surface from too much solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than those currently on Earth.
The model assembled a story of Venus similar to evolution previously hypothetically assembled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over several billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and water vapor was burned by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped, and all that remained was a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of a greenhouse gas -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their findings from the new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Colorado Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing his inability to participate in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
For a long time and intensely over the summer, I thought about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs and take it to the next level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations is in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league's best coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and the first place in the Central Division, but Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the play-offs, and during the last two years, he always failed to get matches after the season.
Team Avalanche in the season 2015/2016 scored 39:39:4 and it lacked five points to get the second wild card in the Western Conference.
Goalkeeper Roy, who enrolled in the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Platform Workers Resume Talks and Break Strike
The top officials of the acting parties said that strikes over wages for oil rig workers in the North Sea have been suspended, while all parties to the dispute have gathered for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the Wood Group oilfield services company have occasionally occurred on the North Sea rigs operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to resolve the current disagreements,” the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is a protest against wage cuts by as much as 30 percent.
Wood Group cut tariffs this year and paid its North Sea suppliers about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The tariff cuts come after a 10 percent cut for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell has removed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries to modernize its processes – immediately after a mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain’s decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes of a generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the region's economy.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just some,” he said.
By comparison, almost $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea in 2016, while the average over the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades
The Kepler Space Telescope's most recent mission to assist astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, and also how the time of rotation is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between star mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching maturity and formed more than 125 million years ago.
Now it turns the fastest.
At moments of maximum rotation speeds, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by measuring the time between discovering recognizable points on stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger ones make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that the slower-moving stars are more massive, while the fastest-moving ones are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and the speed of rotation.
"The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, in both younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There’s still a lot we want to know about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational speed, so to speak, “hanging their dancing boots to a nail.”
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotational speeds in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a Qualification Agreement Necessary?
If I did not apply, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could transfer to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without registering for specialization education?
My point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacancy only in a slightly more distant hospital, but in about six months there could be a vacancy in another one where I would like to work later.
I have no idea how to deal with the situation for about six months, the question continues.
Mgr. Lenka Vlková responds.
No legal regulation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - a hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure reimbursement of costs incurred in increasing or deepening the employee’s qualification.
In the field of health, long-term pressure is being exerted not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the mobility of health workers, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional competence and specialised competence to exercise the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is explicitly true that participation in specialised training is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not to increase it).
This means that a qualification agreement can be concluded according to the Labour Code only if the costs are at least CZK 75,000.
There is no legal regulation or obligation to apply for specialization training.
The law only lays down the conditions for application for inclusion in the field of specialization education.
However, according to the law, a doctor is entitled to exercise the profession of a doctor already by completing the necessary university studies, although under the conditions laid down by law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation where professional experience completed in another field of specialization can be included in the specialization training of a doctor, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
Theoretically, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the interviewer.
However, given the fact that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it is advisable to consult the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Professions), since the Ministry of Health legally provides a consultancy and consulting service related to the inclusion in the specialisation training and its course.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors in Syria's Aleppo region are calling for U.S. intervention.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege (the rebel parts of the city by government troops) and has not used its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, according to a letter to the White House.
“We don’t need tears, compassion, or even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not encircled again,” the doctors said.
Russian forces supporting the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have announced that they will stop strikes in the Halab area every day for three hours from today to allow safe passage for humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 CEST all military activities, airstrikes and artillery fire should be stopped.
U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed the move, but said a two-day ceasefire was needed.
According to the AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors operating in the eastern part of Alab, which is controlled by the rebels, turned to Obama in a letter.
During the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world looks at how complex Syria is, but it does little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate the population from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like lightly veiled threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors said.
Doctors said there had been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria in the past month, including 15 on hospitals where they work.
The saddest thing is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
Small children come to the emergency room with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we do not even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when an explosion cut off the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They were gasping for breath, and then their lives were over—before they could really begin, they recalled.
An army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has surrounded the rebel-held eastern part of Aleppo in recent weeks, leaving more than 200,000 people without food.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes from the Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break through the encirclement and launch a counteroffensive on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides then added reinforcements in and around the city.
