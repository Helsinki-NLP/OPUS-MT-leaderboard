The number of new recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbass has been named
The official representative of the People’s Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), Andrei Marochko, said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbas.
According to him, in this way Kiev plans to “at least somehow complement the units.”
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass dismissals have led to low staffing of units," Marochko said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians drafted into the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces Operation (JFO).
It was assumed that this measure would strengthen the role of Ukrainian security forces in the settlement of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in the Donbass worsened due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities have classified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services.

The head of the British foreign Ministry compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing members of the community.
This statement was made by the diplomat at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As the Daily Mail notes, in this way Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union will only aggravate the crisis.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit talks were at a standstill.
This is how she commented on the results of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was made in 2016 following the results of the referendum.
The UK is expected to leave before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by a number of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
The issue of the Irish border remains open.

Telegram users complained about the failure of the new version
iPhone users have complained about problems in the work of the messenger Telegram after the update, released on September 28.
The user's phone number can be found by his username
The complaints concern gadgets with the current operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after the update, the application shows a white screen or immediately closes.
Representatives of the messenger responded to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in the Swift language.
Telegram temporarily suspended the automatic update of the application until troubleshooting.
On April 13, the Tagansky court of Moscow satisfied Roskomnadzor’s claim to block the messenger Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the telecom operators began to implement the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence necessary to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user upon receipt of a relevant court decision.
Telegram audience after blocking in the Russian Federation decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk forced to leave the post of chairman of the board of directors of Tesla
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their dispute over fraud.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the channel, within the framework of the agreements reached, Musk will have to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to retain the post of Tesla's head.
The founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will be demanded from Tesla.
The money will be distributed among the affected investors.

Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur, included in the list of 50 richest people planet according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX, the neurotechnology company Neuralink and the developer of electric cars Tesla, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The share price of $420 was set allegedly “due to the importance of this number in the marijuana culture”, Bloomberg reported earlier, citing the co-director of the security department of the commission Stephen Peikin.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said that he considered the allegations of fraud to be unfounded, and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
“Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way,” the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
At the same time, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective lawsuit against Musk, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the tweets of the businessman were misleading, as a result of which the sellers of shares of Tesla were forced to buy securities at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Also, other plaintiffs noted that the careless statements of Elon Musk led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Elon Musk was also accused of stock market fraud by the head of the research company Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Musk could not settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would face suspension from the company’s management and even prison.
This, in particular, said CNBC former chairman of the commission Harvey Pitt.
Musk is “a good guy who can’t run a car company.”

In the ROC compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Department of External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk - on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, possible church schism and its political subtext
According to him, now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage”, to rename the church is like putting on a yellow six-pointed star for Jews in fascist Germany.
“This means marking the church as an enemy organization, and this is the purpose for which this bill was created,” the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church said on the Rossiya 24 TV channel.
The metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, since "the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country."

Within the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
This was stated by Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Kozak, summing up the meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
Also, the Deputy Prime Minister shared his opinion on the return of Daniel Kvyat to Toro Rosso and assessed the attendance of the Russian stage of Formula 1.
The result of our meeting with car manufacturers should be in the foreseeable future just the creation of the Russian Formula One car, which has no analogues in the world, - said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to encourage our automakers in this direction.
We were talking about plans until 2024, but I do not think that this is possible at such a time.
I think a more realistic timeframe is within the next ten years.”
From 2012 to 2014 in the "Formula 1" under the Russian license played team "Marusya".
According to the deputy prime minister, there are already investors ready to invest in the creation of a domestic team in the world championship in racing in the Formula 1 class.
I know that in Russia there are fans of motorsport, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula One team.
“We are ready to support them morally.
Let’s hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team appeared, among other things, because such an infrastructure appeared in Sochi.
Tomorrow, the Sochi Autodrome will be sold out.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50,000 tickets.
Look, even at the qualification stands were almost filled, - said the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can say that revenue this year increased by 72% compared to last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to increase the efficiency of the use of the Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will give even more attractiveness to Sochi.
Dmitry Kozak and the main theme of the day for Russian motorsport fans - the return of Daniel Kvyat to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success next season," the deputy prime minister told Izvestia.
He is a very hopeful rider.
Next year, for the first time in history, two main Russian pilots will be able to take part in the Formula 1 peloton.
Although the future fate of Sergey Sirotkin in the "Royal Races" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not impressive: he took 18th place in the qualification of the Grand Prix of Russia.
Let's hope that next season our main drivers will be more than this year, - said Dmitry Kozak.

His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the oldest diseases, previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene ...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, Parisian newspapers wrote: "To defeat fascism and liberate France, he did more than dozens of divisions."
According to experts, Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million inhabitants of the Earth.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous St Paul’s Cathedral in London.
Where, by the way, my wife and I turned our attention to this talkative Russian-speaking guide.
And a few years later, the statue of Alexander Fleming in full growth, we had the opportunity to observe in the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spain.
There, near the main arena for holding the bullfight Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to the man by whose efforts, in their opinion, the lives of hundreds of outstanding masters of the bullfight were saved.
By the way, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at another time and not on this occasion.

Trump talks about ‘love’ with Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the DPRK have come almost to fall in love with each other, joked Donald Trump.
U.S. President Donald Trump made a successful joke about his successes on the front of the settlement of the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have so straightened relations that they are almost in love with each other.
The owner of the White House reminded that the previous administration accepted the North Korean problem as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that the team of Barack Obama so launched relations with the DPRK that they could not even reach the leadership of the country - there simply did not take off the phone.
Back then, the United States and North Korea were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House “beautiful letters,” Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, too, “was cruel” to Kim Jong Un, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has improved to such an extent that the leaders “fall in love with each other”.
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media will interpret them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the fact that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, and is also closing military ranges.
All these are the merits of the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flattered about Kim Jong Un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and the steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, the first-ever talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea took place in Singapore.
After a serious escalation of relations and reciprocal threats of the use of nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a turning point in the protracted US-Korean crisis.
Following the talks, the parties expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the contradictions, although they did not assume any legal obligations.
Positive results of the meeting were the cessation of nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers.
At the same time, other practical steps towards denuclearization of North Korea are still being stalled.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the United States had already sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them “gangster”.

Nice urged to replace the “Moscow language with a Ukrainian product”
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of the native language Larisa Nitsoy called to displace from Ukraine "Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language".
To do this, she offers a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural attack".
Nice shared her thoughts on “the expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian edition “The Observer”.
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will “recover” from this “Moscow language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, earlier on television and radio widely used Russian speech, but in the public space it is almost not left.
At the same time, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only “expansion of borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Previously, Nice shared her experience of maintaining the “Ukrainian-speaking regime” in a children’s camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to court the Watsons bookstore chain, the cashier of one of which communicated with her in Russian.
Having not achieved his goal, Nicey threw a turn at the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in spelling surnames.
Recently Nice said that the name “Russia” was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The writer’s anger could not avoid even the Security Service of Ukraine: coming there and hearing the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, slamming the door.
In the break a man had a conversation, and it brought its fruits
Defender of the "Ural" Denis Kulakov - about the victory over "Arsenal" (2: 1) in the match of the ninth round of the championship of Russia.

"It was such a difficult game, we had a serious conversation with men in the break, and it brought its fruits: they scored two goals and did not miss.
"You missed a few matches because of the injury you suffered earlier this month.
How did you feel today?”
“If you’ve been there for 90 minutes, it’s okay.
Actually, it felt good.
Maybe at the end a little bit of strength so that nothing happens.
And so, doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev brought me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
“What about the atmosphere on the team?”
“It’s no secret that after victories and recovery is easier, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We need to keep up the good work and please the fans.”
"Did you miss the game when you weren't on the field?"
"There is such, a little missed, because really, an unpleasant situation came out.
But once again, thanks to the physiotherapist and the doctors for putting me on my feet.
The most important thing is that we won and delighted the fans.
The rest is secondary.”

In the referendum in Macedonia recorded violations
Four incidents related to violations of electoral law were registered in the Republic of Macedonia at a referendum on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming.
This was announced on Sunday by the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of polling stations, four incidents have been recorded, which have been eliminated, he said.
At the polling station at the elementary school "Lazo Angelovski" in Skopje, 22-year-old K.J. violated public order and calm, insulted citizens and attacked police officers.
He was arrested and taken to the police station.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all violators were immediately taken to police stations.
The Ministry noted that all violations are being checked.
The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can peacefully exercise the constitutional right to freely express their will.
We call on citizens to abide by the laws and refrain from any violations of public order and calm and any violation of the secrecy of the vote,” said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Citizens are asked in the referendum on Sunday to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17, during a ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, along which the border between the two countries passes, signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
This agreement should not only resolve the long-standing dispute over the name of the country, but also open the way for Skopje to join NATO and the EU.
Syrian Foreign Minister: Russia’s decision to supply S-300 is a timely step
Russia’s decision to supply S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems to Syria is a timely step.
This opinion was expressed by the head of the Syrian foreign Ministry Walid Muallem in an interview with the TV channel RT, which aired on Sunday.

I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we are very grateful to Russia in this regard for its efforts," the minister said.
The Syrian Foreign Minister also stressed that the S-300 is a defensive, not an offensive system, and it is designed to protect the Syrian sky.

But I am determined to hold talks with parliamentary forces.
I hope that they are also ready for a constructive dialogue," the prime minister of "News-Armenia" quoted him as saying.
Nikol Pashinyan added that early elections are a “demand of the people”, as well as part of the government’s program, for which the parliament voted.
A “long-term vision of the government,” he said, is also necessary to attract investment and develop the economy.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Pashinyan promised after his return to Yerevan to begin “negotiations with representatives of all parliamentary as well as non-parliamentary forces to discuss the timing and conditions of early elections.”
In the current parliament, about half of the deputies represent the opposition Pashinyan Republican Party of Armenia (RPA).

Serbian President Asks Putin for Support
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic will discuss the situation with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and ask for his support during a meeting in Moscow.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
During the meeting, he plans to discuss with his Russian counterpart the current situation with Kosovo.
In addition, Vucic intends to ask Putin for support.
The Serbian leader made the corresponding statement during a press conference, reports the local newspaper Vecernje Novosti.
According to the source, the head of Serbia clarified that, when talking about the need for support from the Russian side, he does not mean military support following the example of Syria.
Aleksandar Vu<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> said that he does not want to allow a scenario in which any major military clashes could occur on the territory of the state.
The President of the country promised to make every effort to preserve the peace.
According to Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for Tuesday, October 2, writes "Lenta.ru".
The day before it became known that the Serbian president brought the army of the state into full combat readiness due to the situation with Kosovo.
It is about the events of last Friday, when several dozen special forces of Kosovo entered the territory, which is adjacent to the lake, supplying water to the hydroelectric power plant "Gazivode".
It is clarified that the mentioned HPP is located on the territory of Kosovo, but at the same time it belongs to the Serbian power system.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia ten years ago, but Belgrade refused to recognize this fact.
In the spring of last year, the parties stopped negotiations on this issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it can become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
“The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years with regard to Russia has now been an order of magnitude more subdued,” the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "marked as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with Ebola, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, at least in the presentation of a group of Western countries, which spoke quite unanimously on this issue."
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent."
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at least, the choir was not absolutely accurate," the politician drew attention, noting that Russia "was no longer a kind of wall against which tennis ball hits are trained."
The head of the relevant committee of the Federation Council does not exclude that this indicates a certain trend, which, in his opinion, “will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully manifested in a year, two, three.”
"I do not exclude that the current session in some sense can be a turning point," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia's connection manages to move forward in international affairs."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is an "adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just possible - an integral participant in solving global problems of our time".
“I don’t want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we are somewhere passing a point beyond which the movement will no longer be a movement backwards, it will be a movement forwards,” he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context Kosachev called “the request for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
“I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister of foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested in the committee, but now the situation is different,” he said.
“The so-called new liberal order, which is embodied in the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve the world’s problems due to the obvious shortage of ideas in the global space, the shortage of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration.”
"And here the request for a Russian vision becomes more and more obvious," Kosachev said, stressing that in this sense he considers "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

Damascus declares its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that in the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said the foreign Minister of the Syrian Arab Republic Walid Muallem.
According to him, Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has an opportunity to quickly solve the problem of the withdrawal of militants of the banned in Russia organization Jabhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports RIA Novosti.
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus will have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of the Euphrates in case of the Kurds’ desire for separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the negotiations with the Kurdish forces of the SDF were good, until they were interrupted because of the United States.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone by October 15 along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry to lead Chelsea youth team
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was negotiating the transition to the Moscow “Spartak”.
As reported by RT with reference to the Mirror, the former captain of England John Terry led the youth team “Chelsea”.
According to the source, the well-known player, who has been a member of the London club for a long time, will lead the team not older than 23 years.

She said this in a video message to the political prisoner, recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko by the FSB.
According to her, these days, under the walls of the Russian embassy in Paris, there is a rally, the participants of which declared a hunger protest demanding the release of prisoners of the Kremlin.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among them there are people who know you well, starve, supporting Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interview where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea.
She also expressed confidence that the tests will harden every Ukrainian, making us “badger, tougher in protecting the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil.”
Ukrinform correspondent in France Roman Sushchenko was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with espionage at the General Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legitimate.
Russian jailers granted the last request of the Ukrainian before his transfer to the colony.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon"
Vakhtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists talk about how they managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and the stories of popular people about the victory over cancer, gives hope to many patients.
The famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he is alive only thanks to his wife.
Many years ago he was given a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
“I felt like I was hit on the skull with a hammer.
I fell.
Lost the orientation.
They're in the hospital.
There the spoon could not hold, could not stand, fell all the time.
We started to do tests, it turned out, bad things, the artery does not pass blood.
They brought it to Moscow, they said that I had a large purulent cyst in my head, they urgently had an operation.
And during the operation, the doctors behind the cyst saw the tumor," Kikabidze said in the program "Once".
The tumor was malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the inhabitants of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol on the doorstep of his house.
But the wife of the actor did not allow to bury the living actor, she believed that she could cope with the disease and more than a year did not leave the bed of her beloved husband.
If it weren't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive.
Whenever I was in a critical situation, she was there, like a rock," he said.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, now he lives happily in his house in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time he refutes rumors about his illness, then about his untimely death, which sometimes appear on the Web.
The creators of the site "Peacemaker" have added the section "Purgatory" of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary Peter Szijjarto.
The reason was “an attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the foreign minister of the neighboring country was found guilty of “direct threats of invasion of Ukraine” and “supporting separatist sentiments in Ukraine”, as well as participating in “the organization of provocation aimed at massive violation by Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian legislation”.
Note that before Szijjarto in the "Purgatory" pleased the governor of Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Paul and the Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) Onufry.
The reason was their opposition to the receipt of the Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Transcarpathia, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.

The problem is objective, it is that the maturation of children comes quite early, and then large scissors appear between their puberty and the ability to officially enter into intersex contact.

The doctor is sure that many teenagers face masturbation.
The MP believes that to practice lessons about the dangers of masturbation is primarily in schools of "hyperurbanized" regions.

AfD became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant “Alternative for Germany” is breaking another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel’s ratings are falling.
Apparently, Germans have grown tired of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which has made the country a desirable destination for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is most clearly shown by the latest polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party “Alternative for Germany” is becoming increasingly popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc of Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the AfD broke another record, climbing to the second place in the ranking of popular sympathies.
The right-wing Conservatives, with 17 percent popularity, managed to beat the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it is worth noting the fact that the AfD, created in 2013, from a small group of Eurosceptic economists, managed to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings so far continues to hold the ruling bloc CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also falling.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
The Social Democrats were followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
The Evolution of "Alternatives"
The Alternative for Germany party was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government’s policy, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and interaction within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany’s “sponsorship” of the weak EU economies, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German mark and a full exit of the country from the European Union.
Against the backdrop of the deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of the AfD has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took over the Eurosceptic niche and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, winning 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the Alternative for Germany will get seats in the European Parliament.

“We have not been taught the culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood,” the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting Nezalezhna began to fight the literature, which contains the slightest hints of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as many as 201 editions.

Canadians have created a car in case of the apocalypse - magazine
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions has announced that it is already accepting applications for its new armored vehicle.
The Roshel Senator APC
On the topic of the apocalypse, money is made not only by video game manufacturers, film studios and book publishers.
Now a new niche for themselves are mastering and car companies.
For example, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its armored vehicle of the apocalypse Senator APC.
In their free time from fantasy, the engineers of this company create armored cars for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who without much comfort, but in complete safety are placed in a fully welded armored capsule.
This bunker, or otherwise the design will not be called, as the level of its booking corresponds to the B7 standard, is installed on the chassis of the powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, is able to protect the capsule from explosions by grenades and anti-personnel mines.
The Roshel Senator APC Armored Vehicle Salon
In order for passengers not to be harmed even by an explosive wave from a shell that exploded near the car, the interior of the car is equipped with special shock absorbing seats.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire extinguishing system.

To ensure that the weight of the armored car does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepower long-lasting 6.7-liter turbodiesel engine, all the power of which is transferred to the four wheels of the armored car through a 6-speed automatic transmission.
Chances of getting stuck in the armored car of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC no
You can see the armored vehicle of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC will be at a specialized exhibition in Washington, D.C., which will be held in October.
Named the date of death of the universe
The universe will last for about 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The research of the international team of scientists is posted in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
The team came to similar conclusions by observing about ten million galaxies using the Subaru Telescope’s Hyper Supreme-Cam (HSC) camera.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the mass energy of the observed world, the scientists, working within the framework of the standard cosmological model <0xCE><0x9B>CDM (<0xCE><0x9B> Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
In a press release, the Subaru Observatory noted that the observations made it possible to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and taking into account the data of the European space telescope Planck clarified the limitations imposed on the parameters of <0xCE><0x9B>CDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Bang.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to find out the opinion of the people on the pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal initiative group for a referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different wording of issues (in total, the Central Election Commission registered five wordings).
They decided to apply to the CEC with an application for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Do you support that the age established by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, upon reaching which Russian citizens receive the right to receive a pension for old age, is not increased?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the most simple and legally comprehensive.
The majority of the participants in the meeting were supporters of the member of “Fair Russia” Ilya Sviridova (six subgroups) and the Communist Party (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their agreement to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, head of the Vologda subgroup (its formulation was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive an invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy."

In the match "Loko" - "Akhmat" errors Turbine crashed like out of the horn of abundance
The former judge of the all-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of arbitrator Evgeny Turbina in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Locomotive" - "Akhmat" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the judgement of Evgeny Turbin in the match "Locomotive" - "Akhmat"?
- I believe that this arbitrator has confirmed his unfitness to judge the matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressures in the meeting of the fifth round of "Spartacus" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin himself, nor the leaders of the DSI made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of rude receptions fell like out of the horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute, the railwayman Eder falls with his hands in his penalty area, the defender of "Akhmat" Rodolfo.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbine doesn't put a penalty.
- How do you evaluate the episode involving Idov, which was in the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball hit his hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate game of the defender's hand in his penalty area.
The turbine was close to the moment, well sees this episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have seen and reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep and no penalty was awarded.
Therefore, the score in the match was distorted, and sports justice was trampled.
This was the case when the judge by concepts supplanted and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute Turbin did not dare to remove the defender of guests Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight with Kryhovyak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I have shown the second "mustard"?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite on the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of the referee that some teams are penalized for such violations as in the episode with Idova, and some do not.
What do you think of the footballer’s words?
It depends on what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't.
So the referee does not give a second penalty in the opposite goal.
Here is the principle used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee watches who plays.
Here played on Saturday "Locomotive" and "Akhmat" has serious complaints about the work of Turbin, because the team was infringed.
Matt Damon played the accused of rape judge Kavanaugh at the start of the SNL
American actor Matt Damon played the US Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The U.S. Supreme Court nominee previously drew attention to his emotionality and detailed narratives during an interview with Senator Amy Klobushart.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly confessed to his love of beer, but said he never got drunk.
In addition, in an attempt to acquit himself of the rape charge, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin at the time.
These moments were also beaten by Damon.
All I did was drink a lot and not think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunken virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everyone knows that,” said the judge, played by Matt Damon.
Kavanaugh has been elected the U.S. Supreme Court Justice.
Barbra Streisand found strange behaviors in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave completely differently than the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it’s impossible to clone a soul,” the 76-year-old singer said.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog coton de tulear named Samantha, who had to be sedated due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, which was called the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.

U.S. considers Russia’s naval blockade over oil and gas supplies
The U.S. may begin a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The U.S. authorities are so keenly engaged in the fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main suppliers of energy.
On the possibility of a sea blockade on the eve of said the head of the U.S. interior Ministry Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior does not perform police, but civilian functions, including implementing a policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement fell quite within the competence of the department he headed, although it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the U.S. Navy, it controls sea routes in the Middle East and can block them if necessary.
Zinke said that the need may be related to Washington’s desire to prevent Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke reminded that Russia still receives the lion’s share of its revenues from supplies to the world market of oil and gas.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow’s activation in this region, Zinke is sure.
The minister made it clear that the United States still hopes to secure leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push out Russia and Iran, and a sea blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure along the way, Zinke believes.

Formula One Grand Prix of Russia
In Russia, there is a club that I follow.
Former captain of Chelsea and England John Terry - about why he attended the match of the ninth round of the championship of Russia "Spartacus" - "Rostov" (0: 1).
“In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I’ve been watching it for a while and it was interesting to look at it from the outside.
I can’t say that I’m a fan because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and I want to apologize once again for the decision,” Terry said.
Recall that "Rostov" with 18 points rose to the third place in the standings, and "Spartak" was placed on the fifth line, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red and whites will play against the Yenisei on October 7, and the wards of Valery Karpin will take Orenburg the day before.
An expensive violin was handed over to a pawnshop for no price.
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, a pawnbroker offered only $50 for an old and unpresentable instrument.
But the experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that it was an old and expensive tool, and sought advice from an expert.
It turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinando Galliano and is valued at $250,000.
Only the bows to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was recently stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the man who handed it to the pawnshop, but no previous clashes with the law are counted behind it.
The manager says that now everyone who brings a violin to the pawn shop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, an exciting confrontation awaits us: Spartak will host Rostov at its stadium in Tushin under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as you know, not at all foreign to the "people's team".
Particularly piquant to this meeting is the fact that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15, and they share 3 and 4 places in the standings, lagging behind the far-left Zenit and being one point away from Krasnodar, which tomorrow plays with Dynamo.
The red and whites now have a difficult lane: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, the team of Massimo Carrera unexpectedly flew "Rapid", and recently lost home to "Akhmata".
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, "Spartak" with a minimum score and not without difficulty beat in the Cup "Chernomorets", and it is too early to say whether the most popular club of Russia has come close to the exit from the crisis.
“Rostov” three games in a row could not win, but and does not know defeats already five matches.
Let's see if Karpin can extend the win-win series with such a principled match.
The previous meeting of the Carpathian "Rostov" with "Spartacus" ended in favor of the capital team.
Start at 7:00.

London erupts in accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the Cold War, said British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, he said during a speech at the ruling Conservative Party congress in Birmingham.
The threats are growing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, the enemies are operating in gray areas with the help of cyberattacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the biggest of them is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements of Western politicians Moscow has repeatedly denied, reports TASS.
At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that Russia will have to pay a high price if it does not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March of this year ex-GRU Colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of espionage in favor of the UK, and his daughter Julia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country’s name.
The referendum aims to resolve a 27-year-old dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a fervent supporter of renaming the republic North Macedonia.
The preparations for the referendum and today's vote are monitored by international organizations.
The head of the observation mission of the Bureau for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers was organized:
Approximately 100 teams travelled across the country today to observe the entire process, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then to counting votes and drafting protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, which monitored the preparations for the vote, the work of the media, the observance of the law on the financing of election campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulgheri: “About 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the vote.
Groups of observers record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the election commissions in order to present them in the final report.
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
About this on the International day of translators, September 30, told the professional translator-synchronist Berbel Saxe.
She has been translating from Russian and English for over 30 years.
The Germans like to plan events calmly, and the Russians, as the saying goes, “have a long harness, and go fast.”
But it seems to me that this does not play a significant role for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of a translator," the expert said in a commentary to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries can not do without each other, "it is enough to know the history."
And in the future, Saxe said, it makes no sense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny,” she said.
The day before, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country is trying to “establish relations” with Russia and maintain them.
According to her, for Berlin mania is particularly important the project of the gas pipeline “Nord stream – 2”, which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

In the international market, the film, so far released in only 20 countries, raised $ 5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the fight for the first line of the creation of Malcolm Lee, which is remarkable, quite noticeably ahead of another newcomer to the Western rental - the cartoon "Smallfoot", a curious story of acquaintance charming yeti with a representative of the human race, in the existence of which the main character never believed.
The project of directors Carey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reeseg for his opening weekend raised $ 23 million, in general, meeting the expectations of experts who predicted the film 20-25 million over the weekend.
As for the total fees of “Smallfoot”, at the moment they amount to $ 38.6 million (at the same time he debuted in 50 countries): the most active here was Mexico, which replenished the treasury of the film by 3.6 million.
The three strongest this time closed the children's fairy tale "The Secret of the House with a Clock" from the master of horrors Eli Roth, who finally proved that the director can make quality films for an audience of 12+.
In its second week at the box office, the adaptation of the book by John Bellers with the charming Jack Black with Kate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing the total worldwide fees to 53.8 million.
Despite the exit from the top 3, continues to surprise with a sign of "+" thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick "Simple Request": for 17 days in the American box office, a picture of Paul Figg, from which some unrealistic financial achievements were initially not expected from the word "totally", has a total of $ 43 million (including $ 6,6 million in October).
The last representative of the top five this week was the horror film “The Curse of the Nun”, which collected $5.4 million during the reporting period.

Right after the horror Corinne Hardy at the end of the weekend is another representative of the genre - debutant "Hellfest", one of the main youth horror of the year.
In his first weekend, the brainchild of the famous editor (and with the recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who previously worked in a number of large horror projects, including "Happy Death Day", to which "Hallfest" is very similar, earned $ 5.1 million in the United States.
Given the film’s modest budget, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh was "Madly Rich Asians" ($ 4.15 million), which, it seems, do not think to fall out of the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy, which has been on the screens for the seventh week, according to the results of September is the sixth in the ranking of the most cashier tapes in history of the genre with an indicator of 165.7 million.

Of the other premieres of the coming week, it is worth highlighting the musical melodrama “A Star is Born”, the winner of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama “Your Hate”.

Valery Belov: God helped Siberia today
The head coach of "Vityaz" Valery Belov - about the defeat of "Siberia" (3:4) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"A colleague spoke about the fans of Siberia, and I want to celebrate our fans," Belov said on the official website of Vityaz.
“I hope they will support us as well, because now almost every game is full of stadiums, a great atmosphere.
In the game, the Lord probably helped Siberia today, because they were very grossly mistaken, especially our leaders.
In general, our leading leaders lost the micro-match 0: 3, so it was difficult for us to pull out this match, although there were moments.
But still, I'll take the blame.
Because they seem to have missed something in preparation.
Compared to last match, it was a different team.”
"It's an ugly nepotism."
The audience is outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "The Voice"
Viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen fraud".
When in blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But sonial feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative to his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor bias in the first stage.
But the "joke" was delayed, and the father of the star completely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is no longer ready to forgive Agutina such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by the nepotism of the ugly and frank dragging our close relatives to the final ladder.
I even doubted that Agutina will have enough strength and conscience not to drag his dad to the end of the first place," Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina argued in the program "Man from TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "drained" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining this by the fact that the audience still want to see his father on the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not at all the case, the audience wants an objective assessment and see in the final really talented performers, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the members of the "Voice" from the team of Agutin - they were doomed."
“Last time Agutin showed how much he loves his dad, and today he had to show himself as a professional.
“The competition has lost its meaning.”
"Remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project his dad who does not sing but whispers, how can you then name a mentor?"
"Like the way Dad sings, arrange for him a concert in the Kremlin for his money and see how many people will come to this concert."
This is The Voice, not The Cool Sisters.
"It was unprofessional on the part of Agutin."
“Then you have to offer your dad a show, not a show that is made for the money of Channel One.”
“It was a real opportunity for someone, and he took someone’s place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should be more understanding to me than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre drained, and Pope Agutin was brought to the final?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on stage and on screen for decades!
"Because you can't get through nepotism!"
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
Round mud and nepotism.
And the money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theater of absurdity continues!
Users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional “Voice” on blind auditions came out son Gradsky.
At that time, it did not occur to me to take my son to my own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, everything is clear."
Agutin could not act as a professional.
Canadian Military Allowed to Wear Beards to Enhance Spirituality
Canada’s Ministry of Defense has issued an order allowing military personnel to wear beards.
According to CBC, the bill contains instructions for the care of the beard.

The military beard can not be longer than 2 cm, it should also be carefully trimmed, and the neck and cheekbones are shaved.

The innovation is expected to "raise morale in the army and attract more Canadians to the service."

The head of the Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, correspondent member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrovich told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts on the moon.

"There is no consolidated opinion yet," the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
“This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study cosmic radio sources,” Petrukovic added.
He also believes that the moon could be used to test robotics, use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be attracted to the search for primitive organics on the Earth's satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on planets.
Earlier, the head of the corporation Roscosmos said that in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation can carry out a manned flight to the moon by 2030.
An offended customer dumped a basket of feces in 7-Eleven store
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, is said to have “had a tooth” for the manager of a 24-hour store of the chain 7-Eleven: in May, he put him out of the store for inappropriate behavior.
And decided to take revenge on his enemy in an original way.
At midnight he went into the store and dumped on the floor and on some of the shelves the contents of the basket brought with him.
In the basket were feces and urine, which Simms “borrowed” from a nearby mobile biotoilet.
Arriving at the scene of the incident, the police arrested the “avenger”.
He was imprisoned and released on bail of $300.
He was charged with illegal intrusion into someone else's property and a criminal offense, as well as prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
While Simms’s crime looks ridiculous rather than serious, the verdict can be quite harsh, as he has repeatedly violated the law before: behind him are large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, driving a car intoxicated and cruelty to animals.

I had a good start, and in the second corner I found myself between two cars that immediately clutched me.
I lost all the positions I had at the start, instantly, immediately.
He was in a very bad position.
I'm stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the rest of us got to the pit stop, we would get into the "clean air", and the pace would return, but there was no rubber.
Plus, I struggled with my partner, and there was contact with him, too.
I understand he was a little mistaken.
We found ourselves on the toughest track of the season, there was nothing I could do and it hurt a lot, to be honest.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” Sirotkin told RIA Novosti.

Tarpisev called absurd the removal of Glushakov and Eshenko from the basis of "Spartacus"
The President of the Russian Tennis Federation (FTR) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the suspension of the players of the Moscow “Spartacus” Denis Glushakov and Andrei Eshenko from training with the main line-up after the likes of the criticism of the head coach of the team Massimo Carrera, reports “Sports weekend”.
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is nonsense.
I don’t agree with what Carrera is doing.
This only deepens the discord in the team.
First, these are poems, you can read and perceive them in any way you want.
I wouldn't have reacted to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to get bored.
If Glushakov and Eshenko like it, it does not mean that they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
This does not serve the normal climate of the team.
Today Spartak has no game, so this situation did not need to be inflated at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at it together.
"Spartacus" has a lot wrong in different lines, there is incompetence after the introduction into the youth.
The relations within the team, it seems, do not add optimism before this match,” – said Tarpishchev.
The game between the two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
Previously refused "Spartacus" John Terry headed the youth team "Chelsea".
The pupils of "Sirius" discussed with scientists nature-like technologies
The pupils of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute".
The speech of the researchers was held within the framework of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-Like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary "Kurchatov's Codes", during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The lecture of the scientist is published on the website of "Sirius".
Students have learned that modern technology requires a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to produce such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will help nature-like technologies, on which today young scientists are working.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
“The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a huge benefit.
It is the explosive growth of medical technology, it is the improvement of the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is another side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a flip side - a deliberate intervention in the life of a person.
There are always risks.
There was a car - people began to die under the wheels.
Cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology immediately.
I am creating a new medical technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction”, – quotes the scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were the candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-nature-like technologies of the Kurchatov Institute Research Center Yulia Dyakova and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-technologies Vyacheslav Demin.
The Sirius Educational Center in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center is early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online olympiad on information security "CyberChallenge" will be sent to study at "Sirius".

Kemerovchan outraged herd of rams in the cemetery
On September 30, a well-known Kemerovo page in the social network appeared a message from an eyewitness that horned animals freely roamed one of the local cemeteries.
Animals a considerable herd walked between the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some of the local residents noted that there is no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite can even help in clearing the territory from weeds and grass bushes, but some of the residents of the city the behavior of animals did not like:
“This is a grave, not a pasture.
There's nothing for rams to do there.
Of course, you can’t say about the sheep that they blaspheme, but it’s still not the case.” (style preserved) – said the outraged Kemerovchanka in her message.
One way or another, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
Pushing and pushing - what is right?
The word pressure does not exist.
That's right, hitchhiking.
The word "press" in the meaning of "to burden, to influence, to influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "to satisfy".
We use this word, assuming that it comes from the word “pressure.”
But "pressure" and "enjoy" etymologically are not only not close, but even in some sense opposite.
See for yourself.
To suffice (church-book, obsolete) means "enough, full, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".
Pleasure, pleasure are related words.
Previously, it still had the meaning of "not to depend on anything, to have self-sufficient meaning" - "to satisfy yourself".
The Old Slavic word “dovl<0xC4><0x9B>ti” is related to the words “to command” and “will”.
Pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (squeezing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaid<0xC4><0xAB> - "to oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "to satisfy", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
Thus we have this very "d[a]input", which is also used in writing through "a", which, in a good way, is incorrect and impossible from the point of view of the processes of origin and development of these words.
So, it's right to crawl.
But this word is outdated, in its correct meaning is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people are having a negative impact on you from above, use the word “press.”
You can also use the design "exercise pressure", but remember that this is an office.

Miracles do happen in our lives!
One of them was told on Twitter by the German journalist Christy Dietz.
She wrote on her page that her four-year-old son had parked his running bike (children’s bike without pedals) around the same light pole for a whole year.
And one morning, a cute sticker appeared on the pole with a photo of a green bike and the inscription: "Only for him."
There was no limit to the excitement of mother and child.
Christie thanked the anonymous benefactor and praised him for the interesting and fresh idea.
Her tweet quickly spread across the social network and made many people smile.

"How wonderful!"
"Thank you for the wonderful communication in this world."
"I think there are a lot of people in the world who are capable of doing this."
"Unfortunately, they don't get as much attention as the scoundrels."
“This is the world we need!”

Russian bailiffs demanded a debt from a dead old woman
In Kurgan, bailiffs demanded that a long-dead woman pay a state duty of 200 rubles.
This is reported by the "Ural Meridian".
In mid-September, relatives of the late Maria Mitrofanovna Slepneva received a letter from the Kurgan Department of bailiffs, in which it was reported that enforcement proceedings had been initiated against the 105-year-old woman.
According to the verdict of the court, the woman must pay 200 rubles to the local tax inspectorate.
After receiving the letter, the relatives of Slepneva turned to the department for clarification.
The police department promised to deal with the situation.
Users of social networks, having learned about the incident, advised relatives to file counterclaims for non-payment of pensions and social benefits to the old woman for the "lived" after her death.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vu<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> has ordered to maintain the highest level of readiness to which the country’s Armed Forces were brought due to the situation in the northern autonomous region of Kosovo and Metohija.

One of the participants of the action Neuroz Duman said that the purpose of the demonstration is to show the unity of society and solidarity in this problem.
Refugees and migrants should not be considered different, and migration itself is the mother of this society.
Numerous migrant communities and anti-racism organizations have sent an open letter to the Minister demanding his resignation.
With the help of the operation in Syria, Russia protected itself from terrorists
In the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 were destroyed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.
This was said in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former commander of the VKS, the head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of aerial weapons: the Aerospace Forces carried out and continue to carry out all strikes precisely on terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist objects have been destroyed in Syria for three years, for example, ammunition depots, fortified areas and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the defenses of the jihadists were hacked - this was a decisive contribution to the advancement of the Syrian government troops, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria made it possible to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (ISIS, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of ISIS fought about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries.
And we are talking only about recorded persons, not counting those who were not identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant borders - otherwise this evil "would have rushed to us".

Syria accuses U.S. of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
The [Western] coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it has destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas targeted by its actions, it has committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These murders are war crimes under international law,” he said.
According to Muallem, the US and its partners provided “direct support to terrorists” because the objectives of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and implied “sowing chaos, death and destruction in their path.”
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost over, and the country has become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of an illegal foreign presence, and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation of the warring parties in the republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 aircraft struck the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with banned phosphorus munitions.
The United States has denied all accusations.
President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
This was stated by the head of state during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance by Hungary of its passports in Transcarpathia.
In defending Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine," Poroshenko said.
According to Poroshenko, as president, he will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are - in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the Foreign Ministry’s position in the passport scandal with Hungary, which consists in the intention to expel the consul of this country from Beregovo.
“I fully share every letter that is said by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” the President said.
As reported by "FACTS", on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of issuing Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine at the Consulate of Hungary in Beregovo.
They took an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Pavlo Klimkin noted that the consul of Hungary, who appears in the video with the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself, or will be expelled by Kiev.
It also became known that the prosecutor's office of the Transcarpathian region opened a criminal case on the fact of issuing passports to Hungary.
The incident is classified under the article "Betrayal".
Putin secretly flew to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the Council of CIS States, and also held a number of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
Data on flights of the Russian "Board No. 1" on the Flightradar website indicates that at about 6 p.m. Tajikistan time on September 28, the Il-96-300 took off from the Dushanbe airport and took a course to the north-east.
In the area of Lake Balkhash, the aircraft's transponder was turned off.
The direction of his flight indicates that the liner could fly to Khakassia.
According to the agency "Baikal24", the president in Abakan on the night of September 29 personally met the head of the region Viktor Zimin.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend, but the sources of the site believe that the real reason is the “problem of the second round”.
The second round of elections of the head of the region is to be held next Sunday in Khakassia.
It was attended by Valentin Konovalov (CPRF) and the current head of the republic Viktor Zimin ("United Russia").
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the upcoming tour together with Konovalov should take part Andrei Filyagin ("Fair Russia").
Khakassian media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new acting head of the republic, as well as make a decision on the fate of Zimin.
Putin already visited Khakassia in January this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president’s favorite places to relax.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict, which has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people fled to other countries, primarily to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
According to Damascus, the military action is nearing completion and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have made life difficult for people and deprived them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and to allocate funds for this purpose.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide aid to Syria, saying that first of all a political solution to the conflict must be found.
Volkswagen fully admitted his guilt in the “dieselgate” in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American division of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The group's losses are estimated at least <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 billion.
This amount includes not only fines and compensation.
By June next year, the automaker is obliged to buy or repair 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company’s management said that the commitments had already been fulfilled for 83% of the cars, so the program would be completed ahead of schedule.
"Volkswagen" is fully trying to compensate for losses and restore the trust of customers.
Thus, the management of the concern has recently changed again, and a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: this is the right the authorities received in February this year.
An approaching typhoon paralyzed traffic in Japan

Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church Metropolitan Hilarion compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against Jews.
“It is like putting a yellow pointed star on a Jew in fascist Germany, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and for this purpose this bill was created,” the metropolitan said on the Rossiya-24 television channel.
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and “put it out of the law”, the clergyman believes.
“This is the Ukrainian church, and the faithful of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country,” he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter presupposes the renaming of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The governor of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The governor of the Holy Dormition Pochaev Lavra Metropolitan Vladimir made an appeal to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the monastery.
At different times in our history, our predecessors and relatives of faith and spirit, Christians, had to profess their faith and defend their sanctuaries.
Given the situation that has developed, and the information that we have, and the threats of executions that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to experience something too," the metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
The governor of Lavra also stressed that, probably, "you will need your physical presence."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threaten to massacre, and therefore we will protect our sanctuary."
Who is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - the Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, we must be ready to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to follow the example of those who mislead the believers.
The UOC has the canonical status defined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make a dependence on the new-style patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has," the governor of the Lavra noted.
He recalled that since October 1990 the UOC has been canonically independent and fully independent in its administration.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, the Tomos already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need?" - said Metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky, urging believers and all citizens to ask whether other denominations have Tomos, whether they are independent from the Vatican?
Believers, to some extent, figured out and decided which temple to go to.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and strife again.
Some are filled with envy that domes are shining on the temples that they want to destroy,” the priest emphasized.
The Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
Lavra is located on the top of Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the thirteenth century.

Your man will not speak loud words to the whole country and then simply not fulfill them," Buzova <0x40>arina_prostyle said.

Keep your nose up and move on,” wrote <0x40>kreszentia_f.

If we continue to play well, victories will come.
The head coach of Moscow “Dynamo” Vladimir Vorobyov – about the defeat of “Automobilist” (0: 1) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"It was a good game, interesting, although it went to the goal" - Vorobyov quotes the official website of "Automobilist".
“They tried to play very easy.
I really liked the first period.
We didn’t take advantage of a few good moments.
In the second period, the opponent pushed us a little bit, we stood.
But the removal of us a little "feeded".
The guys played great, did the coaching setup.
I think if we continue to play well, the wins will come.
Not scored, with zero goals, the game is not won, but the content of the game itself was correct.
“Luck will come if we continue to play in that direction.”
"In your opinion, "Automobilist" increased compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
“At that time, there was no foreign team.
In the pre-season, the teams solved other tasks, played a lot of young guys.
I think there was a completely different game, a different hockey.
"Automobilist" is a good good team.
It is clear from the tournament table that the team plays correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
Lots of good players, lots of leaders.
Good defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were preparing.
They knew the team was going undefeated, they wanted to break it, but it didn’t work out.”

Macedonian opposition leader refuses to vote in referendum
Macedonia on Sunday, September 30, held a referendum on the issue of an intergovernmental agreement with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party "Inner Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (VMRO-DPMNE) Christian Mickoski said that he will not vote in the referendum.
As party spokesman Naum Stoilkovsky explained, Mickoski decided to abstain from the vote in order to express his disagreement with the treaty, which he considers “pernicious”.
According to the spokesperson, the current referendum decides the question of renaming the country and nothing more, while the strategic goal of the party is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov refused to participate in the referendum on September 30.
He explained that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. the Macedonian leader considers the renaming of the country a negative factor.

The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav republic - the Republic of North Macedonia - was signed by the Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 this year during a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, along which the border between the two countries passes.
This agreement should resolve a long-standing dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje’s path to NATO and the EU, TASS recalls.

The U.S. is pleased with the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
The sharp deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 was widely reported in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in the Afghan territory, the militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year was a record year for the number of bloody attacks that killed thousands of ordinary Afghans,” Patrushev said.
The troubles in Afghanistan did not begin yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group "Al-Qaeda" (banned in the Russian Federation), settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, America and its NATO allies launched the military operation “Indestructible Freedom”.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of U.S. troops are still on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
U.S. troops have been pushed beyond the fences of dozens of their bases.
How can they buy back from the militants for money - just so they do not touch them.
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country's territory - 40% percent, according to Patrushev.
50% - the movement "Taliban" (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
But they grow there fast.
The goal of creating a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia is exactly what they failed to achieve in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be fine with that.
In the 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opioids) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
Colossal growth of areas sown with opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country’s name.
The agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor's right to be called Macedonia, seeing in this name an attempt on the eponymous Greek province and Greek history.
Ljupko Petkowski, a political scientist: “Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia has the right to a better future, the hope of social change.
And Greece will assert the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises can not make everyone happy.”
The ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of renaming the country.
Against - the conservative opposition and the president of the country Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, it makes no sense for Macedonia to join the EU – it is enough to have a partnership with him: “Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.
Faye Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice made by the citizens of Macedonia will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole.
