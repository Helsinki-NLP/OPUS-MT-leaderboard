I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like how your hair looks.
I really like this wine.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I'd love to learn French.
It would be really nice if you didn't say anything.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize a guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember when I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I rinsed one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said it might swell.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I said yes.
Is anybody in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is something missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him playing cards with all of them.
I saw him over there.
I saw my sister tear the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
How far is Boston?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
Are potatoes high in calories?
I don't see any conspiracy here.
"I can see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston amongst me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Is everyone happy?
Is everyone having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
I shook my head.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I should take her home.
I need to pack.
I have to go get changed.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more polite.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed her my room.
Is it cold outside?
- Is it done?
Is it far from here?
Is Daddy really too slow today, or is it me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
- Is it true?
I slapped him.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a dead man.
I slept in the boat.
I slept on the bus.
I slashed the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you the house?
Isn't this wonderful?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I stepped on something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean yes or no?
Is there such a word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paid for delivery?
Is there a doctor here who can speak English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anybody else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you'd like to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it a real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place vacant?
Is that what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do it.
I still don’t understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still love a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Is Tom contributing?
Is Tom dead?
Is he dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did you talk, Tom?
Is Tom alone there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm studying art history.
Suddenly I felt old.
I suffer from asthma.
I suggest you study more.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving you to bend over.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's what I suspected.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't catch a fire with you if you were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is the freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about which items to pick up.
The whole thing makes sense.
It all seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't have been a coincidence.
So, no, no.
It's not possible!
They're for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
That could never, ever, ever happen here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That'd be good.
It didn't bother me.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That disappointed him.
It'd look good.
I don't mind.
It won't get any better.
It doesn't look much different.
It doesn’t matter if you don’t want to do it; you have to anyway.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to be helping.
Doesn't sound like God knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm teaching him English.
It's right for me.
That gave me an idea.
I've got a lot to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's getting cold.
It has nothing to do with luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I think about it all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one.
I think I'm getting a cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go out and eat.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made a nice statement.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we were supposed to leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's awful.
I think that's ridiculous.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's heartless.
I think Tom's a conservative.
I think Tom is brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom is wonderful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's petty.
I think Tom's a jackass.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's hardened.
I think Tom's vain.
I think Tom's resourceful.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better not to drink this water.
We better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we're gonna join in.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we ate enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should pick her.
I think you should do this yourself.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should handle this on your own.
I think it helped enough.
I've been thinking about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I thought I was imagining it.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
I didn't think Tom would want to come with us.
Didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a lot of work to do.
Didn't you want the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your watch.
Don't you hate him?
He seemed tired to me.
I thought you might be able to help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls shorter than you.
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
Didn't you say you could swim?
Didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played chess better than I did.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
I'm in terrible pain here.
Mary gets annoyed when Tom leaves the lid of the cup lifted.
It is a multi-stage process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day of school.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no way I'm going to finish the job in one day.
It's less wet today than it was yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that? No.
I'll pay.
It doesn't come into consideration.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get into our heads that we can't ignore nature.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It seems wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds annoying.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It will soon be Christmas.
It will be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
He looked awful.
He looked ridiculous.
I guess you're right.
It looks very tasty.
It looks different.
Seems familiar to me.
It looks like an egg.
Looks like I drank too much last night, my head's on fire, I'm hungover.
Looks like these two are back together.
Looks like these two have settled down.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got closer to Tom.
Scratch me.
It worries me.
It could be dangerous.
It may be difficult.
Maybe it's too late.
It may sound like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll wind up tonight.
It may seem strange.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It might rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he's not welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I can't.
I told you it'd be hard to pull off.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna get rough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I've taken care of it.
I'm out.
I came back by bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
It's probably not worth the wait.
It rained two days ago.
It has resulted in great difficulty.
I tried to explain to him, but he didn't push the button.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
I am sincerely sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
It's about to go down.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is advisable to check for any negative effects if you drink alcohol while taking the medication you were prescribed.
It's a child's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
Everything is in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they talk about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's about to leave.
It's so much fun.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's already eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
Too bad you ruined it.
It's about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
It's a fake lead.
It's a risky plan.
It's a pity the concrete doesn't burn.
It is quick to walk.
It's simple.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They dismantled it.
It's just a pain in the ass.
It's been raining for a week or so.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely hot.
It's best if you don't talk so much.
It's better to be alone.
It is better to be optimistic and deceived than to be pessimistic and right.
“It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.” – “Then why are you still alive?”
It's empty.
The sauna is here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
It's closing time.
It's cold here.
It's well known that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to gauge his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier like this.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged it.
It looks like her style.
I think that’s the only possible conclusion.
Looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's evil to curse.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's ridiculous.
Watching TV is fun.
He's getting dressed.
It's darkening.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be beastly.
It's gonna get colder.
It's going to happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's good. It's good.
It's improved.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
I care what you think about Tom.
It is impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
It's in excellent condition.
It's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
The simple question is where.
It's just fiction.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It is made of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
It's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
It didn't happen that way.
It won’t be easy to do without a lot of help.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by fools.
It's not a big deal.
It's not just guesswork.
It's not just a pen.
There is not enough light to read.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It’s not often that someone buys a hat for a thousand dollars.
It's not worth much.
It snowed last night.
It's obviously a typo.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
Sounds really cool.
Sounds really good.
It's our job to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He probably still has it.
It's probably still available.
It's broken.
Actually, it's a lot.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It really sucks.
It's a real shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's cool!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious we don't need any evidence.
It's starting to get dark.
It's still dark outside.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It still doesn't work.
It is still growing.
He's still there.
It's strange how people in the tropics eat spicy foods like curry.
It's stuck.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
It's thundering out there.
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
It's so strong.
It's bullshit.
It's totally wrong.
You can't stand the heat.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom immediately.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
I don't give a damn.
There's wind.
It's work.
You lose.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's all yours.
The water only takes three minutes to boil.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would take.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
It turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was an honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was embarrassing.
It was after midnight.
It's been an arena day.
It was a great series.
It was all my idea.
You were fine here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an amazing evening.
It was an ambush.
It was an awful sight.
It's been an honor.
It was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
It was a duty to me to spend the evening with a smart, witty and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a great day.
It was a lovely evening.
Such behavior was childish on his part.
It was filthy.
It was effective.
That was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
Yesterday was fun.
He slept through the night.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
It was very kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn’t easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been proven that fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those that live on cats.
It was so glorious.
That was pretty funny.
It was really cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
That was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was blowing a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture hanging on the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was incomprehensible.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very crowded in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Better.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Lies won't help.
It won't help you.
It's working well.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk by tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
I need you urgently.
I used to listen to you.
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I use that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I've already written everything that needs to be written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I’ve always been helped.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked her a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed with something else.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
I've been much worse.
They betrayed me.
I've been notified.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing for hours.
I was careless.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been gone three weeks.
I was happy here.
I was helping her.
I was helping them.
I was hired to find them.
I've been kidnapped.
I have lived here for many years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I've been busy.
I've been looking for you for a while.
I have been learning French since the age of 13.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I've watched it before.
I came for them.
I came to bring him a present.
I cut off my finger.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences for the whole month.
I decided to forgive him.
I decided to forgive them.
I decided to take the train.

We're being childish.
We're out of line.
We are being deceived.
We're paranoid.
We're both from Boston.
We're busy now.
We're inspecting the entire area.
We're worried about him.
We're worried about them.
We're done talking.
We're eating apples.
We're embarrassing her.
We're embarrassing him.
We have experience.
We're flying over the clouds.
We're lucky.

We'll be fine.
We're gonna find her.
Let's go pick them up.
We'll have company.
We're here to help.
We're still warming up.
We're lazy.
We're leaving Boston.
We're like brothers.
We're looking for them now.
We're looking for them.
We're mannequins.
We won't let you die.

We're so pissed.
We're really good.
We're really in danger.
We're sophisticated.
We're sorry.
We're staying.
We're the best.
We're playing with fate.
We're the champions.
Were there any survivors?
We're Tom's parents.
We're trying to help him.
We'll turn back.
We're very efficient.
We're very pleased.
We're wasting time.
We are dependent on work.
Are you scared?
Were you home at ten?
Was he one of them?
We're your neighbors.
Was he honest?
Was he sympathetic?
Did you watch?
Were you with someone?
We wrapped the carpet.
We sat and waited.
We should ask him.
We should ask them.
We should both go.
We should do this again sometime.
We should give him some time.
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
We should go home.
We need to help them.
We should let Tom get back to work.
We shouldn't have let her go.
We weren't supposed to be up until 2:30.
We need to set a trap.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
We should've given up sooner.
We slept in a tent.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
We started talking.
We're in.
We stayed up all night, trying to come up with a plan.
We still need a plan.
We still want to help.
We stole it.
We talked for two hours.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
We tried to get them to come.
We tried to get them to tell us.
We tried to hide it.
We understand that.
We value our customers.
None of us were right.
We've all read that.
We've already cleared that up.
We baked cakes for them.
We're just getting started.
We're expecting her.
We were looking for them.
We've suffered a lot.
We were deceived.
We tried.
We waited.

We have to put them to bed.

We've made mistakes.
We've met a few times.
We only met once.

We want more money.
We want to be famous.
We want to hear it.
We want to help him.
We want to help them.

We left at eleven o'clock.
We went to pick strawberries.
We went to the same church.
We all cheered for her.
We were all shocked.
We've both been busy.
We didn't have any broken money.
We were utterly confused.
Then we were eighteen years old.
We'd hang them.
We were arguing.
We were in a hurry.
Just in time.
We just came from there.
We've been looking for you.
We didn't fight.
We weren't hungry.
There were many more of them than of us.
We were passengers.
We were playing golf.
We were ready.
We were so close.
You didn't save the bell.
We were so worried.
We were so young back then.
We arrived first.
We were under attack.
We were worried about you.
We're going to have a discussion about the prognosis.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.

You better let me do it.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
He deserved better.
You would have done the same in my place.
You did a bad job.
You did a good job.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You weren't listening.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about it, didn't you?
You already did.
He did his best.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
You're sick of it, aren't you?
You wouldn't happen to have a key, would you?
You don't have much time.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
You fucking know.
You don't know anything.
Dream that you know.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
You don't have to be present for this.
You don't have to go.
No need to panic.
You don't have to wear anything disgusting.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't know business.
You don't want to do something that reminds them that you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me nuts.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You are entitled to a phone call.
You go pick up Tom and come back.
You hit one.
You're wrong, people.
You guys were right.
Your hair is a mess.
You hate us, don't you?
You have a great job.
You have a conscience, don't you?
You have a habit that I don't like.
You have small breasts.
You have beautiful lips.
You've been a great mentor to me.
You've been busy.
You have lovely eyes.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
I pay my respects.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
You've never seen one, have you?
You haven't solved your problems, have you?
You have a really good handwriting.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a present.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You need to sit down.
You need to stay as far away from him as possible.
You can't lose your stamina.
You have to try, Tom.
You have a lot of beautiful lips.
You have very penetrating eyes.
You just heard.
He just got back from vacation.
You almost missed it.
You almost missed Tom.
You stay out of this.
Kids, you should stay here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your red eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You learn fast.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
He left me in despair.
You let Tom get away.
You want your life, don't you?
You're gonna be okay.
You'll get confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You will be informed in time.
You'll feel better.
You'll get a copy.
You'll feel better.
You're gonna get them back.
You're gonna get wrinkles.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
You're coming with me, that's it!
You'll have to ask him about that.
You're gonna have to study harder next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
You'll never get into that club.
You'll never guess.
You'll never know.
You'll understand when it's time.
It looked beautiful.

You look beautiful.
You look pretty bad.
You look so good.
You look sad, what's wrong?

You look very handsome, Tom.
You made some money.
He gave his word.
You're upsetting me.
You may be needed.
You can go anywhere.
You might have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't hurt to slow down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.

You need to help her.
You need to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You need to make this work.
You didn't ask why.
You didn't give them a chance.
We only have one life.
One is life.
You need to get in the habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
You should go to the dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You pay me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
It went red.
He ran as fast as he could.
You're burning the car.
You're burning the car.
Your complaints upset me.
Your transgressions have defiled the graves of your forefathers.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are tempting, but we're full.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.

You're acting weird.
You're embarrassing.
You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.

You're not that young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You won't find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're below her level.
You're below his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that terrible.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
You can go now.
You're nuts!
But you're smart.

You're wrong, Tom.
Your eyebrows look weird.
Your future starts today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.

That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call anytime.

You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
You seem to already know the answer.

I promise you.
Now you do, don't you?
You have to let me take a message to Tom.

You have to work together.
You wrecked Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen worse.
You've been postponing this too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You guys were amazing.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
He was lucky to survive the attack.
You were wrong.
It's not like you were wrong.
You were right, Tom.
He drove fast.
You were great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
