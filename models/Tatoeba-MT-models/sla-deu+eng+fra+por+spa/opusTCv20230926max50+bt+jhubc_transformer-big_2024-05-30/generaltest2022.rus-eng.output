From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those ladies of Balzac age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev for teenagers is not so interesting.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

I remember with horror these feasts and guests in the house of parents.
Guests are on the doorstep, and on the stove still chops are fried, mom is slouching on the floor.
Oh, my God, he's been sitting at the table for a while.
And then the laundry, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you bring groceries, two days of cooking, the day after cleaning.
What about the guests?
They are good, and the cake is always with them.
Since then, I don't like the holidays, the guests.
Even for my family, I cover the table at a minimum.
And I make them delicious, baking very often just for that.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccine is imminent
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with a new strength.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough to fully protect.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weideldt, is convinced of this.
About this on Saturday, December 11, reports Die Welt.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn," the expert said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus can be carried out “in combination with influenza vaccination”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron".
The new option is especially dangerous.
Thus, the likelihood of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than in Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies stress that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus Omicron.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: “the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.”
“This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron strain infection,” BioNTech and Pfizer said in a statement.
A third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, advocates shortening the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, Salzberger believes that accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience shows this very convincingly,” the expert stressed.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21<0xC2><0xAE>.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created with the use for ice fishing, and not only for fishing in the fall.
These vibes have a greater proportion than those of similar analogues in size, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting bait.
Another recognizable feature is the upper float made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration with vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when caught in the wedge, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, up and down movements with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space cluttered with underwater vegetation, coryags and other obstacles, behind which it is possible to catch.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when fishing in the winter for a boar and a large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when a pointed and aggressive bait feed is required.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
Equally successful, Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To satisfy its whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib game in the plumb is able to irritate the passive pike, not responding even to the hedge.
When caught, the Bet-A-Vib sling shows range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with the glaze and braided cords even of large diameters.
For fishing, the dropping of pike, pike, erch or perch in addition to uniformly relevant and "step", sometimes with "screaming" on the bottom.
If you catch in heavy places, you can replace the front tee with a double, which will reduce the likelihood of catches.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
With equal success, it can be used on both relatively small and fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, said about 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company Wagner in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
"There are currently more than 7,000 mercenaries of the Wagner PMC in Libya.
They also have airplanes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabia airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte),” Anadolu quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are “trying to seize” the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after “bringing their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Maintain Presence
According to the interlocutor of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “located in Libya.”
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and a port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the PMC Wagner enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training of local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries.
According to the media, the “Wagners” allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is neither in the law enforcement agencies nor in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not in the form lists of personnel.
The company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier, the ambassadors of the 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
The decision is expected to be approved by the Council of the European Union on December 13.
The situation in Libya
Libya’s Supreme State Council is the second de facto chamber of parliament with advisory functions, with Islamists dominating it.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting for the elections of parliamentary deputies and the head of state from December 24, at least to February 2022.
“The elections are less than two weeks away, and the chances that they will pass on time are rapidly decreasing,” the report said.
Against this background, the Libyan High Election Commission has postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reported.
Foreign policy through the eyes of the Russians
38% of Russians see in foreign policy of the country more successes than failures, 29% believe that failures prevail.
Examples of success - "in Syria protected, restored peace there", "the decision on the "Nord stream-2"", "the whole world was intimidated that the cool weapons", "Crimea we squeezed".
The main failures are the “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from the world”, the Public Opinion Foundation said in a study.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paperwork - all public services have also become only digital
The government of Dubai reported a complete abandonment of paperwork and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the emirate news agency WAM.
“Today marks the beginning of a new phase in the digitalization of all aspects of Dubai’s life – we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government,” said Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of the Emirate and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai.
Now, the internal and external workflow in all state institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all industries without exception: health care, utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and document digitization has begun in Dubai since 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in cash equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens two days a year.

They knew there was someone at home.
Turkish car production and exports fall below 2020 level
Turkey’s car production and exports declined sharply in November against the backdrop of the lira’s depreciation.
As a result, the industry performance at the end of 11 months was worse than last year's result, reports Bloomberg, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were produced from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year.
And if in the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed positive dynamics to last year, then in the 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this fall was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferral on credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation on the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform" reports.
"According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, in fulfillment of the order of the Head of State of April 1, 2021, the Order of the Chairman of the Agency of April 9, 2021 No. 127 "About approval of the Procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans of small and medium-sized enterprises" was adopted," Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans provided for the provision by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities of deferral of payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including SMEs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME entity.
In the application of the borrower could be specified a different period of deferral of payments.
During the deferral period, the claim work, notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the lender's collection of commissions and other payments were suspended in respect of the borrower," the deputy prime minister said.

Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the strain "Okmiron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective response of the body
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "Okmiron" can be dangerous.
The reason should be looked for in the conditions of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that the “okmyron” originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, during the mutation, he did not encounter any resistance from immunity.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, there may be more than it is supposed, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments the pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate the ocmiron more easily than those who have a strong protective response of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-olds die, and 60-year-olds in the form of sneezes endure this.
The immune response is insane in the young, it is completely inadequate: where it was possible only to threaten with a finger, it beats like a gun on sparrows, - concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, you can often stop only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is the temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, snoring in the throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia by the end of the year can begin to vaccinate the younger generation from 12 to 18 years.
Virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of the Ministry of Education and Science Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from Covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, as well as the pupils of kindergartens," said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the genomic engineering laboratory of the Ministry of Education and Science.

Immunologists have hypothesized why obese people become victims of Kovid
The authors of the paper examined the adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
The scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from Covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid an immune system response.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably capable of this as well.
Biologist told about the causes of dementia
PhD in biological sciences Semyon Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and talked about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person finds it difficult to navigate even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and lack of certain vitamins most often lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible,” he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the occurrence of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical exercise, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.

Egypt has returned about 30 thousand illegally exported artifacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return home about 30,000 artifacts that were smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel, the chief inspector of the Department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, Egypt has recovered 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C.,” he said.
Abdel Gauad said that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Department officials are currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, the specialists "track auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient skeleton of a man discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
Auction house Christie's on July 4 held an auction, at which the bust aged more than 3 thousand years was sold for $ 5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
Egypt in recent years actively seeks the repatriation of illegally removed from the country at different times monuments of antiquity.
According to authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research by “black diggers”.
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in the Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
Credit Suisse wants to get access to employees’ personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the US, the Swiss bank does not issue its employees corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current regulations, a bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank exercises the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote operation, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to solve business issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline by which employees can get acquainted with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse did not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".
It is already outside any literary associations, spilled with imaginism, it is itself, but known, in demand, sometimes strongly scolded by critics, even maliciously, but the reader is ready to carry it in his hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motifs" is completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" is written, 8 books are published, the collection "Soviet Russia".
And the main success - at the end of June 25, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the modern poets Sergei Alexandrovich was not given such honor, he was the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
The money was needed that year more than ever.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy Sophia Tolstoy, it was necessary to equip the family life, to maintain the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
Life seems to be getting better, there is something to rejoice about, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark colors, as if the nightmare of the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don’t know where this pain came from.
Is it the wind that whistles?
In an empty and uninhabited field,
As I grow in September,
It drains the brain of alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin strongly surrendered, looks bad, is clearly ill.
Increasingly, repetitive convulsions, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably, is not only alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergei Alexandrovich someone was put, there were no reliable documents.
Let's say, referring to May 1923, when Yesenin at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (Yesenin will get to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But the evidence of the poet's chants, scandals on this ground, drives to the police are abundant - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the terrible romance of the poet with the green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with a friend, the imaginative artist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good incomes, never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he found himself in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
The elders recalled:
"I only came to spend the night, and in most cases insane, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o’clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the stairwell.
Falling, scratched his face and wheezed.
Having regained his senses a little, he began to cough unceasingly, sprinkling all the sheets with blood..."
Yes, and Yesenin himself after a trip to Europe and the United States (the United States then had a dry law, but Duncan took with him a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
“I didn’t see anything there, except the bars and the streets.
At the end of the day, I stopped remembering people.
And drinking, of course.
“I drank because I was thirsty.”

The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a “weapon”
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Jablo<0xC5><0x84>ski expressed his opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intends to return to such an “operation” next year.
The Deputy Foreign Minister made a corresponding statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
According to the website kp.ru, earlier the European Union put into effect the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It involved 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they said they were ready to further expand restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve".
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by the Shadow hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughingstock
The secular events of 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September at the premiere of the film "Not Time to Die" he appeared in a velvety raspberry jacket and a traditional "Bond" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket that did not match the royal dress code at The Earthshot Prize, and then chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charity Foundation.
A few weeks ago, the trend was applied to himself and Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
His sons were dressed in the same clothes.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, received in "Gazeta.Ru", they began to buy in 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a fitting silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury velvet jacket segment this season is represented in almost all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most coveted is the Gucci model, in which one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci" was the ambassador of the brand Jared Leto.
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of weaving threads, a dense fabric with a furry outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budgetary options are made of cotton or polyamide, but also, accordingly, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but its relevance.
"The velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a solemn event, - explains Wahoshkin. - It will be suitable for those cases if the invitation has a dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced party with abundance, - the authors of the Telegram-channel about men's fashion "Beautiful Brammell". - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed secular events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin offers to combine a jacket made of velvet with the same outfits: classic pants with arrows, monochrome shirts, silk ties, lofers with brushes, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from "Beautiful Brammell" are sure: it will be inappropriate to appear in a velvet jacket ordinary employee at a corporate party, but if we are talking about "the leader of those who manages this event, then - "yes", he is such a thing in the subject."
If the employee ranks lower, and his goal is the desire to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to knock out financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate the phrase "not in the Shadow of the hat," - the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, so excruciatingly pulls.
And it is not at all associated with the cute face of a young girl.
Honestly, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbyed, that is, paid.
billions of investments.
Are they in grief?
The price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also not in circulation - both gas, oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are now selling.
Fuel demand is wild.
It's dripping.
Then who's on the fly?
As usual, the buyer.
Does the Indian problem bother the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who have “slept” the energy crisis.
They've done their job.

I have not seen a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within the average passenger.
Perhaps, if such characters are confident in their beauty so that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will not sit down to such, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful people", but certainly not because of their appearance.
The slave who is aware of his slavery and fights against it is a revolutionary.
A slave who is unaware of his slavery and dwells in a silent, unconscious and speechless slave life is simply a slave.

The immunologist said that the revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of the coronavirus "omicron"
A revaccination in four to five months may protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection, Omicron.
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination after six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very large period"
"With the previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four," the expert said, calling, in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to engage in revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titre of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person was given two vaccinations and a booster, or he got sick and vaccinated, or he got vaccinated and got sick, then he received "hybrid immunity", that is, antibodies are many and neutralizing enough," the expert said.
G7 warns Russia of "large-scale consequences" in case of invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost” Moscow, but concrete measures are not described in the document.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, and the High Representative of the European Union, stand united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers further called on Russia to “weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding transparency of military activities”, as US President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Vladimir Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
“Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in return.”
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine’s restrained stance.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement said.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Trass said that Russia would be subjected to "serious consequences" in case of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed the “united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of global GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia.”
Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective than the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
"We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety," Professor Malik Peyris said.
At the same time, the scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain can cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and increase mortality if no additional measures are taken.
The head of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine Alexey Reznikov accused the government of the former Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel in blocking Kiev's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine’s purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the permission of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andrei Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect from Berlin deliveries of weapons under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons with the risk of military escalation of the conflict in the Donbas, despite the “occupation” of part of the Ukrainian territory by Russia.
The same “illogical” position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine expects that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he spoke for the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

G7 warns Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues military aggression against Ukraine, according to the final statement of the parties.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces near the country’s borders.
“Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs,” the UK government said in a statement.
The ministers of the G7 countries and the EU High Representative noted that they are “united in their condemnation of Russia’s armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine.”
British Foreign Minister Elizabeth Trass warned at a press conference in Liverpool about the "big consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences.
The G7 wants Russia to abandon aggression against Ukraine,” she said.
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, the G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
We were talking about negotiations in the Normandy format.

Ways to Recover Stolen Money Through Online Stores
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of major losses when bank card data fall into the hands of attackers, it is recommended to store the main assets on the card or bank account, which are not used when shopping online.
Some of the savings can be deposited into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend creating a separate card for online shopping.
If the money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure security technology, you can launch a refund procedure.
“Within the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility is assigned to the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service,” the representative of Promsvyazbank said.
Expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be challenged and refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the customer, if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Yekaterina Mizulina, a member of the Public Chamber and director of the Safer Internet League, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 requests were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
German Chancellor-elect Olaf Scholz has arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland’s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
The Polish judiciary, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland for finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland has refused to pay the fine, and its highest court has ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
Germany’s new government, sworn in on Wednesday despite demands from Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to halt Nord Stream 2 in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an agreement with Germany to halt the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm the reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine’s border, a position confirmed by the G7 on Sunday.

Found money in the wall of the church plumber will pay $ 20,000
A plumber who found money inside a church in Texas will be rewarded.
This is reported in the press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin is preaching, promising that devout Christians await wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under insulation.
He handed over the find of the church and, according to him, did not even receive gratitude from Austin.
“I wanted to hear him say, ‘You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you have done and what you could have done,” KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The find appears to be related to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks, which were stored in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, for information about the criminals announced a reward of $ 25,000.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount, as the award has already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated $ 5,000 for the award and later received another $ 20,000 in a donation from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber’s honesty.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person".
That is why the attitude towards it is so negative.
And it is not that "she is financially significantly richer than all the writers," as they write here.
There are people who are richer, but not all are as brazen, as provocative as this madam.

"The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities obliged unvaccinated tourists from the coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme of complete protection against COVID-19 is disclosed
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences, honored figure of science of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and administering a nasal vaccine.
With intranasal use, a large amount of immunoglobulin A is formed. When the vaccine is injected, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you inject both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision on dual vaccination yet," the doctor said.
The chief prophylactologist of UrFO, Dr. Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help by the fact that in this case, the protection of the body, presumably, should become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Huseynov said that a new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is the picture observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, um...
I talked to the dog (died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm home, feeding, caress, love and games for a liquid bitch, then go ahead.
But Pesel was trained and smart.
He chose my company and went home.
The video method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I stopped many owners from running after the dog, although they complained that there were 200,000 running away (pomske), I took his hand and took him to the other side.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog that ran away somewhere.
In Europe, mass protests of opponents of vaccinations do not stop
More than 40,000 protesters took to the streets in Vienna, Austria.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the plans of the authorities to make vaccination against Covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards that read “This is a false pandemic,” “I will not be vaccinated.”
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the Autonomous Community, a Covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was taken by the authorities of several regions of the country amid an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
A group of protesters threw stones at police officers.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.

WHO detects Omicron in more than 60 countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron" has been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported in the WHO report.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it began to actively spread only from the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may bypass the spread of the delta strain, the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which now leads in all countries without exception.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar findings have been made in the UK as well.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the omicron will displace the delta in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "omicron" at the moment several hundred people are sick in the Kingdom, and according to estimates up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals every day.
What the British health care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain "omicron" is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
How the Russian Sputnik V reacts to the Omicron is not yet known - it will be clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the Omicron strain.

The Soviet era is called the “time of demons.”
In those days, people believed in God more honestly than they do today.
And they were brought up practically according to the laws of God (love of neighbor, do not steal, etc.).

The revenue of the mobile games sector in 2021 reached $90 billion. The leaders in the number of downloads were casual and hypercasual games, in which there is no or almost no plot, and video design is minimal.

Russians warned about a new scheme of scammers
The attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to the director of products of the company Ivideon Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger, which is associated with the distribution of video communications, are dipfeyki.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the features of the behavior of a person.
Abutalimov added that using a dipfake, attackers can call acquaintances of the victim by video or create a video with the participation of a copy of the person for blackmail.
“Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a knowledgeable attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
Leading Varonis system engineer Alexander Wetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to technology using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow me to paint much and walk in short skirts, showing stockings and pantyhose on my legs.
It's a province, but there was such a thing in the store.
In the big cities and Muslim women painted, and the legs were shown.

Here are five steps that can help you avoid diabetes.
Blood sugar problems are some of the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sugary foods raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by poor nutrition, but also habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise to adhere to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the emergence of a feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova told about the “weekend migraine” in workaholics
Several factors can lead to deterioration of well-being on the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working weekdays is often a "weekend migraine", said a well-known doctor-endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher of the Faculty of Basic Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific head of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine Zuhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, especially often suffer from this workaholics, who on the weekend there are headaches, brokenness and weakness.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue for a week, there are quite a lot of objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changing conditions.
On the weekends, our lives change radically.
"Sleep long, lie on the couch all day, most likely eat more and drink less," the doctor argued. - Due to the lack of coffee, a small breakage begins.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness. "
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, then there will be a reaction called a jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most at the weekend.

South African scientists say Pfizer's vaccine is low-effective against omicron
In South Africa, declared the low effectiveness of the vaccine Pfizer against "omicron"
Scientists in South Africa conducted a study and reported the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of omicron) corresponds to (the level of) vaccine effectiveness of 22.5% against infection with symptoms, due to which ... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned, according to the study, published on the portal MedRxiv.
At the same time, experts have clarified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could trigger a new wave of pandemics in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much sugar is in the usual foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should keep in mind that under the unfamiliar word in the composition of the product can be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
Several dozen names can be represented on the label, in fact, denoting sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other dried sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black melon), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce sugar intake is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonizing the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
“That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role,” the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to ensuring that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, since at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which they recorded Berlin’s support for Ukraine’s energy transformation.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, in the framework of coalition negotiations and discussions of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline so far “does not comply with the regulations” of the European Union.

Hackers Hacked India's Prime Minister's Twitter
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as legal tender, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office was asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the Prime Minister said that in Twitter quickly reacted - access to the account was restored.
India’s prime minister’s page had already been hacked in 2020 and urged to make donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, a majority of New Caledonian residents voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote has become significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted in favour of the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia taking part in the elections.
According to France-Presse, “the outcome of this election left no room for doubt,” as pro-independence supporters urged voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and "fair" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists have said they will not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Élysée Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron should speak on the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia’s independence has largely revived the last weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is “the last region of the European Union’s presence in the Pacific.”
“New Caledonia must necessarily remain French,” said Erik Zemmour.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonian people to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it is not his responsibility.”
However, the president added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.”
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France".

WSJ readers criticized the article on relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the article expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and allowed a number of insulting statements against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "show a united front against Russia".
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," one reader commented.

Earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km north-east of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The hearth lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of jet drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create ANKA-type jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
This was announced on December 11, by Alexey Arestovych, a freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian President.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and the like,” he said.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the course of military operations of the joint forces in the Donbas.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Defense Ministry signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, where they will conduct training of personnel, as well as testing and maintenance of the Turkish Bayraktar UAV.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum “a big real step forward”.
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport.
At Singapore's Changi airport, lions have escaped.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions, arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were going.
One of the escaped lions lay on the roof of the container.
The beasts could not get away from him because of the protective net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended with the arrival at the airport of employees of the organization Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all Singaporean zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to bring them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion fled from the owner and walked through the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies suggest that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to get some types of cancer, in particular, colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the required dose on the contrary promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure in a greater or lesser way.
Kitchen recommends not taking vitamin B9 tablets without the advice of a doctor, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid cereals with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutritionist Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Because it is found, among other things, in avocados, Fine recommended that men after 50 years eat this fruit more often.
In the UK by April due to omicron strain could die about 75,000 people
Forecasts of British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus in the next five months in England may die up to 75,000 people, if not tighten the restrictive measures in the winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian with reference to the study of experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergencies under the British Cabinet, by April 2022, at least 25,000 deaths due to the omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and in total about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the incidence, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent congestion of the National Health Service if the omicron strain is more contagious than the delta variant, and current vaccines cannot rule out infection," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of the LSHTM.
The UK Health Safety Agency said that if the rate of spread of the omicron strain remains at its current level, about 1 million cases will be detected by the end of the year in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
So far, 1898 cases of omicron-strain coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
On December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid pointed out that in reality, this figure can already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superyachts in the world increased by a quarter
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the effects of climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress of $ 50 million and above will not decrease.
However, they are becoming more and more.
25% more ships were ordered this year than the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn’t been such a boom in the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of being infected on land and prefer to escape the pandemic on board their own boat.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted by zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, as long as their yacht was ready at least a year or two earlier.
“People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The wealthy, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, space travel, life on yachts or flights on their own planes cause annoyance in society, as the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and proposing new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, it is impressive not only the number of super-yachts ordered, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a stern length above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-meter-long REV Ocean yacht.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht provides a "moon pool", as well as a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
On existing super-yachts, it is common to have platforms for helicopters, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as the yacht of wrestler McGregor - a platform for martial arts.
But it has symbolic significance, given that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of the overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the footprint of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet’s largest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission footprint covered his yacht Eclipse, 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and have the crew drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not evoke sympathy from other people when they, like Australia’s richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns the mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no place for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships of 50 meters.
Identified a dangerous weekly dose of alcohol, leading to the development of bowel cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts concluded that the use of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
What’s more, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than women.
The exact reason for the development of this type of oncology scientists can not determine, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they do not know how much the four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to learn for sure how intelligence is developed in animals.
Although a dog’s vocabulary isn’t as extensive as that of a human, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The work of the scientists was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can’t play chess or write poetry, they don’t know anything about politics, economics, or art, but they often fool their masters.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show better results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics are not enough for accurate conclusions.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine prepared for the trade of the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will “trade” on Ukraine’s accession to NATO, said analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the publication “Glavred”.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations on the assurances of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of the countries "to join anywhere".
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but just send the offerer.
And in relation to Ukraine, a bargain is planned," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks a dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparations are carried out in secret, quickly and immediately move on to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the group to be detected and deployed by counter-forces,” he said.
China stimulates the development of the railway industry
Advanced Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition 2021, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province (Central China).
Core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said Hou Zhaowen, a spokesman for the company.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was commissioned earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operational efficiency of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its rail vehicle exports, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “Chinese speed.”
In May of this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. rolled off the production line the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China, intended for export to Europe.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the subway train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
“China’s rail transport equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yaosiang, head of the trade and investment department of the China Committee for International Trade Promotion.
“This industry represents the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market,” said Feng Yaosiang.
After more than 60 years of hard work, having carried out a number of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of equipment for railway transport, with a full range of auxiliaries and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosian, the country ranks first in terms of the level of electrification of railways and in terms of operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
In an interview with Sputnik radio, Semen Golosheykin, a candidate of biological sciences, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of mild cognitive impairments, such as an inability to concentrate, planning, a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
There is ongoing debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and a risk factor for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheykin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis of brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, the study of foreign languages and active communication will help to reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining moderate levels of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive memory involvement and logic of thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and expediency are still being discussed in the scientific community," Golosheykin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining moderate levels of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking," Golosheykin said.
Earlier, the charity for the study of dementia in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient acquires difficulty in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a condition where a person can not find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-nerve treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical council created by the Georgian Ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is leading in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," the expert said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president should be sent for special rehabilitation.
“We call this neurorehabilitation and psycho-nerve rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia,” Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
In the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical care after the staff of the prison service subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

In Spain, there were protests against COVID-passports
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia held protests against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports the agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action amounted to about 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for trips to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment establishments.
Many protesters came without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city declared a medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
Since the start of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus have been detected in Spain, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The bills on the unified system of QR-codes the government submitted to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit the venues of mass events, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retail trade with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or transferred disease, or a medical guide from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel by train and airplane.

The Rise: How Chinese Become Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow President Xi Jinping to raise 1 trillion yuan, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taivu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping works are carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task in the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, it is still far from that.
Games adviser Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year, more and more Chinese go to the slopes in the winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downes believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and build the necessary infrastructure for recreation there.
Gao Macong, 70, lives in Chunli, near the venue of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was run from Beijing to Chunli, now no one from the locals suffers without work.
More and more stores are opening in the country, selling clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes open outlets with dishes of national cuisine.
Taiwan now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment - to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO said
More than 500 million people worldwide could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has hampered human progress on universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have said.
On the occasion of the International Day for Universal Health Coverage on 12 December, WHO and the World Bank have published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to failures in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in health care systems.
In this regard, immunization coverage decreased for the first time in 10 years, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
WHO and the World Health Organization said the pandemic caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation is pushing more than 500 million people “into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets.”
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, with more than four billion people with little or no social support.

Taiwanese minister disconnected from broadcast at "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
Taiwanese Digital Minister Audrey Tan’s speech at a panel discussion during the US-organized “Democracy Summit” was translated into a no-video mode, according to a recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, said the image was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map, shown by Ms. Tang, was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world according to the degree of enforcing civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as “free” and the PRC, DPRK, Laos and Vietnam were highlighted in red as “closed”.
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the views of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the U.S. government."
China was not invited to the Summit for Democracy.
According to Reuters, the map, which was shown by the Taiwanese minister, could go against the policy of “one China”, which adheres to Washington.
One source said that after showing the map, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized “Summit for Democracy” was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civic associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the summit, Nobel Peace Prize winner and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charges."
You're being told that they're cooking, and there's rotten meat everywhere, in fact, the meat remains with the butcher to the last piece.

But how many and when they have children, it is not your business until they gather these children to hang around your neck.
If that is not the case, then what right do you have to condemn them?

According to the circular, people leaving these cities must submit a negative result of a COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours of departure.
Those arriving in cities with land checkpoints must pass at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be effective from the date when the relevant provincial-level administrative units define and publish the zones of these cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land checkpoints that meet certain conditions may consider establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The foreign Ministry told about the "sad withdrawal" in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of cooperation led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries began not yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long journey we have taken with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose on Russia approaches on many issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk making optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there is no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and that the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns about the dangers of vaccination with a nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may have allergies and need the help of doctors, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccination centers at airports and shopping malls, but I would do this at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it is desirable that the person after that sits next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that act literally in a minute or two, which sometimes is very necessary,” said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in the use of the drug will be accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the vaccinated with nasal congestion is sucked out after injection.

In the UK for the day recorded 1239 cases of omicron strain of coronavirus - RT
In the UK, 1,239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of the coronavirus have been detected in a day.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the Omicron strain were recorded in England, 38 people contracted a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3137 people.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimated in a pessimistic forecast that 75,000 people could die in England by April due to the outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the Omicron strain.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “invasion” of the territory of the country.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not to experience suffering itself," the Kremlin spokesman said on Russia 1 television.
Peskov argues that this is “understood by everyone in the world”.
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars against Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank Herman Gref believes that this is impossible.

The people of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French TV channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of voters voted against independence.
Supported independence from France 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were canceled.
Voting participation on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by calls for separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonian voters opposed independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the discovery of the archipelago as part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, the territory is endowed with a special administrative and territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

WHO says Omicron is less dangerous than Delta
The World Health Organization (WHO) provisionally believes that the "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in the disease of a new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, Omicron is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the omicron strain protein suggest a reduction in the vaccine's effectiveness against infection and variant transmission.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it (the “severity of the disease” – ed.) may be less severe than the “delta”, – stated in the technical message of the WHO.
The organization notes that so far all reported cases of omicron infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than the "delta".
In Russia, two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered.
They were “previously immunized,” according to the Gamaleya Center.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova said that so far there is no reliable data that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine named four scenarios for Zelensky
The former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and may also compromise on the Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko said in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called the “perfect storm”, suggests that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export ... internal protests and confrontation of the authorities with key financial and industrial groups," the ex-parliamentary added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against everyone".
This forecast will come true in the case of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine can make compromises on Donbass, as a result of which confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's positions will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third variant of the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the opposition of dissident groups of the population and the president, which is why it is likely to take control of the power bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
In the course of this variant of the crisis, Zelensky will begin a “reformatting of power,” Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the “father of the nation”.
This can lead to some event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, man-made catastrophe or aggressive actions of Russia, the former deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from the poll of the sociological group Rating showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record low values, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the case of the upcoming presidential elections of Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while for the former president of the country Petro Poroshenko - 14.5%.
At the same time, only 19.3% of all respondents expressed support for the president.

Arrested for the action on Red Square, the poet: "For the quotation of Yevtushenko, 10 days are given, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week for ten days arrested 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkova.
A student of HSE was detained on Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag #poetvrossiyabolschechpoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Evtushenko.
Alexander was drafted a protocol on the administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
The first time he was detained on January 23 in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to attract attention to poetry in general, now, unfortunately, interest in it is lost, to the decline of the culture common in Russia and also little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," - explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How did the police treat you this time and before?
What did the department ask, how did they comment on your action?
This time the staff was more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, no matter how ridiculous it sounded in some context of the word.
In Pushkin took the OMONs and took it hard.
Asked the standard about motives.
When they heard, in principle, looked if not approving, then understanding.
With the exception of the monkey blown on all four sides, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was going for.
And if after the action under this hashtag begin to write their poems, at least a few people, I will serve these 10 days not for nothing.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe alone.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of others so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly and nevertheless resorts to the help of an interpreter.
And at official events, a transcript is kept according to the old author’s manual, and the stenographer does not have to know several languages.

Researchers told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the body’s systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to the large content of cartilage, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit of the root crop, it is better to stew or cook, rather than fry in oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other foods with high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate-containing foods that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in its production in personal auxiliary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only replace imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the issuance of "Yandex"
Candidates for flight
In 2015, the copyright holders of the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirated sites of the Runet, and most of them ceased to exist, says the general director of the Institute for Internet Research Karen Kazaryan.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to including regular domain name change, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search engines of both Yandex and Google, you can see pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikian - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the issue of search engines, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but, judging by the quality of the video, it is the so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 years later" of the TV channel TNT (part of "Gazprom-media") is available.

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Current Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the five-year mission is to assess the habitability of Venus' clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then it may be more likely that life originated on Earth,” said Mihkel Paiusalu, the head of the Estonian Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The theme of metauniverses became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into a Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of their own metauniverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metauniverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of a pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models for them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money move into digital format.
Anya, you are right, nutritional change is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fatty and harmful.

You can eat on a spoon, try - and enough.
After all, the truth is ten days off, you can cook any tasty and healthy dishes.

The British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill has been unable to give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts will turn into failure.
He wrote this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, with inflation in second place, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the price increase for goods is temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless generosity of central banks has already outlived itself" and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates, adjusted for inflation, will correlate with the expected growth rates of GDP.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as rising poverty and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, the head of the global research department “Opening Investment” Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations on the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the potential for growth will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar, Shulgin called the monetary policy of the Fed, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the background of the coronavirus pandemic.
Forced to agree.
But one thing is pleasing: if you compare yourself with yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenues in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is leading.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The related Kia brand Hyundai growth is even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and the increase in the weighted average price of the car - for the year Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - stronger dynamics of the price was only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales from Korean brands increased not so significantly: according to statistics of the Committee of Automobile Manufacturers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms, the Japanese Toyota - for cars of this brand, the Russians spent for 10 months 275.5 billion rubles, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand increased both sales volume (by 37%), and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz has a good sales growth and a weighted average price at the same time - more, for example, than BMW - hence a greater increase in financial capacity," said Tatyana Arabadzhi, the general director of NAPI.
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are showing fantastic performance, also significantly increasing their financial capacity this year.
Russian Lada in the dynamics of revenue growth shows average market indicators (plus 28%), on cars of this brand Russians spent for 10 months 229.4 billion rubles.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity are the companies whose sales of cars in units in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and in the negative - for 10 months, the Russians spent on SUVs and pickup trucks of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and interruptions in production, covering the entire world automotive industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last increase in price (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Regularly rewrite the price tags for their products and other automakers.
The volume of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will increase further - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation contributes to this, as well as the desire of automakers to recover past losses, experts believe.
In a car shortage, I think many automakers have even been able to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of past periods, which they could not put into the price of cars before.
says Vladimir Bespalov, analyst of VTB Capital for the automotive industry. -
I think the automakers are doing very well financially now, maintaining a high margin of sales.”
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
As supply increases, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to get their income at the expense of volumes, says independent consultant for the automotive industry Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now automakers are striving to get the greatest profit from every car sold, notes Burgazliev.
The increase in the volume of production of cars is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is heated by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the situation on the market, cars have turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with a mileage, can now be sold more expensive than the original value, the expert states.
Biden spoke about the transfer of U.S. military to Ukraine in case of an invasion of Russia
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in the event of an “invasion” by Russia.
This statement was made by the President of the United States Joe Biden.
"There have never been such plans," the White House chief said, answering a journalist's question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using US troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to the eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
“We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 – all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia,” Biden said.
Earlier, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
I'm leaving these interviews right away.
If at the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible burdock and wash a cup - it is scary to imagine what will be at work.
I'll find myself a normal place, without an eycharnaya layer, where you immediately talk to the manager.

If a scammer calls from such a number, such as an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another force structure, then it is ineffective to drop it immediately, and most likely not to put it on the blacklist.
Because to confirm his lies about his involvement in the power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to frighten and persuade.
We need better advice for the people.
That's bullshit.
I can't believe that was the case.
They don’t know what to blame anymore.
They reached the queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame, except for the most ...
And it would not be easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if our people care about their people.
Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear...
As in Japan... before the elections, the influence was weakened and infections became less...
