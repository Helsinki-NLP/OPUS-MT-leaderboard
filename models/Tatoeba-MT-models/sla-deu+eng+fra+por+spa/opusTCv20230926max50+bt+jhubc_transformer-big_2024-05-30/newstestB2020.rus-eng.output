How's that?
If we had known, we would probably have fixed it.
But first of all, I think we need to add in such a component as martial arts.
I think we have a problem with that.

China strongly opposes U.S. adoption of the “Taipei Bill”
China strongly opposes the U.S. adoption of the so-called “Taipei Bill”, which seriously violates the One China Principle and the principles of the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiqués.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s approval of the bill is also a serious violation of international law and fundamental principles of international relations and a gross interference in China’s internal affairs, Ma Xiaoguan said.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and related issues relate to the internal affairs of China.
“We call on the U.S. side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue to avoid further damage to Sino-U.S. relations, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” he said.
China must and will be reunified.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone and no forces, Ma Xiaoguan stressed.
TikTok hides unwanted videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
Imagine China / Reuters
China’s TikTok social network censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet’s independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong.
The documents found in the publication tell that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) with the help of the application promotes the goals of China's foreign policy abroad.
Most of the violations related to China’s policy fall under the “hate incitement”.
In each case, TikTok places undesirable publications in a context appropriate to the general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of China’s socialist system falls under the general ban on “criticizing or attacking the politics and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on mentioning the Tiananmen Square incidents or the genocide in Cambodia falls under the "distortion of the history of China or other countries".
The document also lists the banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen", including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, U.S. Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Jozo Abe, and South Korean President Park Kyo.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Posts from the first category are deleted by the administrators of the social network and may result in the blocking of the user.
Not too strict violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applicable: “We are now using a localized approach for moderation, as well as engaging independent local specialists.”
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the "Producer Center".
"Producer Center" is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Producer Center" agrees with the representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without agreement, Bogdanov reports.
When asked if TikTok can comment on politics or Putin, Bogdanov responds in the affirmative and says that he has seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of the agency Our Didgital Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for users TikTok lists in the user agreement: you should not post shocking content, discriminatory statements and so on."
But under these rules, you can bring any content that does not like moderators, notes Zaripov.
Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
According to the user agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons over 13 years of age.
The administrators of the social network check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, says Bogdanov.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, his account may be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the coworking WeWork.

Russians warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from scammers who replace the phone number of the bank has increased.
This is reported by "Kommersant" with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator gave telecom operators information about more than 2.5 thousand numbers from which customers of various financial organizations were called.
In 189 cases, operators found a number replacement.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases a restriction on the use of financial services was set.
Deputy Head of the Department of Information Security of the Central Bank Artem Sychev said that a wide range of Russian banks faced with the change of the number.
He explained that the operators do not always respond to the warnings of the Central Bank about fraudulent calls, citing the lack of such an obligation in the law "On Communications".
In the bank "Otkritie", Rosbank and Alfa-Bank confirmed information about the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with the change of the number.
As reported in the press service of "Beeline", part of the information about fraudulent calls, which was transmitted by the Central Bank, was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are really used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would lead to failures in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters’ numbers, to which the telecom operator will contact every call to check the number.
He explained that in order to establish such a base, it would be necessary to amend the legislation.

The Secretary General said this during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Asked whether the topic was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they really discussed this issue, and also stressed that in his answer he did not give the timing of Ukraine’s accession to NATO.
According to him, any country that would like to join the North Atlantic Alliance is obliged to meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards.
In the Crimea offered Zelensky an alternative to the course in NATO
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, instead of the course to join NATO, should be engaged in establishing good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
On Friday, September 27, the co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinets said.
"The President of Ukraine does not need to repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should listen to the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, who he listened with a sour face, and improve relations with the President of Russia," Chegrinets told RIA Novosti.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.

Barcelona to blackmail Neymar
Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the transfer of the striker to French Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost reached court, but the Catalans offered the player to settle the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they will refuse to return.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, started an interesting trick: under the agreement with Barça, which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward was at PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received $22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining $18 million.
Moreover, the Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payment.
When it became known about Neymar’s claims in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona sent a counterclaim.
"Blue-pomegranate" insist that the bonus was relied on for the performance of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was entitled to only a quarter of 40 million euros and demands a return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Neymar and Barça almost agreed on the return of the “prodigal” player to the Catalan fold.
True, the deal failed, but the hope for the return of the forward remains.
And here, as reported by Sports.Ru with reference to insiders, the lawyers of the club told the representatives of the player that if the issue of financial claims will not be settled in pre-trial, it will exclude the possibility of return of the Brazilian.
Neymar himself is so eager to return that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.

At the same time, the Reform Party wanted Andres Sutt to join the council instead of Jaanus Tamkivi.
But Laar replied that the goal of the Reform Party was to get two seats on the board of the Bank of Estonia - so that in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi, Andres Sutt would be included in the board.
On Tuesday, September 24, the Riigikogu rejected Laar’s proposal to appoint new members of the Board of the Bank of Estonia.

Mass riots on three
The “Moscow case” against the participants of the summer protests the further, the more noticeably it breaks down into separate fragments and loses political content.
The evidence of the “mass riots” itself does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to put the case on hold, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to a drop of charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire the society, but it will surely leave the security forces, whose efforts to fill the case with defendants and evidence have been in vain, in an extreme irritation.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining in the case of the accused under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexey Minyailo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligation, and after a few hours and completely rehabilitated: the SCR dropped the charges against him.
Minyailo spent almost two months in prison, several professional communities stood up for him: historians, priests, writers.
After that, only two accused of participating in the riots remained in the case (initially there were 13 accused): Sergei Fomin, transferred on September 3 under house arrest, and Samariddin Rajabov, whom the court on the eve extended the arrest until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a representative of the authorities, Art. 318 of the Criminal Code).

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
The most famous is pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including cardiovascular, some cancers).
Known sources of phytoestrogens - all legumes (the most popular - soybeans), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such dietary supplements can not be a full replacement for natural hormones.
You can not exclude the possible harm from such additives.
For example, against the background of their reception, the production of their own hormones can decrease due to the fact that too many analogues from outside enter the body.

Hydrometeorological center called true folk signs
In Russia, there are many folk signs by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometeorological Center checked all the signs that supposedly work.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted, however, in the short term.
As the scientific head of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia Roman Wilfand said, if the sun is red during the sunset, then the next day will really be nice, as our ancestors noted.
If the sky is white, it will rain the next day.
The second working sign is based on bird watching.
More often they talk about swallows, if they fly low, then it is usually to the rain.
It is explained simply - when the humidity of the air is high, the moss wings are wet and the birds are forced to fall in order to hunt insects, writes TASS.
On different continents there are people's signs.
Pike Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day you need to watch the marmot coming out of his hole to determine the time of arrival of spring.
Unidentified oil spills found on beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil spills of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
Pollution centers were scattered over two thousand kilometers of coastline.
Reports of the first discovered oil spills began to arrive on September 2.
However, every day until Thursday, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase.

They are all identical and we are talking about crude oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, to which the samples were transferred for analysis, said that in their composition they do not correspond to oil extracted from fields in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it got into the ocean current," the coordinator of the union of oil workers of the states of Pernambuco and Paraiba, Rogerio Almeida, told the Brazilian news portal G1.
He also added that despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the northeast of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered with an oil film.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning polluted beaches.
Meanwhile, experts of the institute recommend tourists and locals to bypass the oil spills and warn about all detected pollution.

Russians have nothing to save for retirement - V. Matvienko
The speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have enough savings for the country to fully earn a bill on a guaranteed pension product.
The practice of increasing pensions at the expense of personal savings is quite common in the world.
It is another matter how timely its introduction is with us.
"In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has income, from which they simply have nothing to allocate for an increase in pension provision in the future," Matvienko said.
The Russians, according to the speaker, can not understand the mechanisms of formation and accrual of pensions, because “constant changes in this area have finally confused them.”
This does not mean that I am opposed to the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a welfare state, and we are obliged to do everything to improve the size of pensions and social protection of citizens.
But steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities," Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on a guaranteed pension product) will develop, then several basic principles must be provided, including voluntary, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation on September 6 announced the sending for approval of the draft law on the guaranteed pension product (GPP).
Among its main elements are an exclusively voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, guaranteeing the preservation of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax incentives for business and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man stays in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony and Disney agree
The news about the departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe caused anger among many loyal fans
One of the most famous comic book characters, Spider-Man, will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures have agreed on the rights to use it in the films of the franchise.
This became known from the press release of Sony, which says that the third part of "Spider-Man" with Tom Holland will be released on the screens on July 16, 2021.
Previously it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on the distribution of income, which is why “Spider-Man” will leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony owns the rights to the film.
She leased them for the Marvel films, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenue from revenue from movie box offices, and Disney - from souvenirs and toys.
As reported, at some point this situation ceased to suit Disney, and the company wanted to revise the agreement.
Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said he was delighted.
It’s amazing that Spider-Man’s journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue.
“At Marvel Studios, we are all very excited to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a symbolic figure.
He is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world,” he said in a statement.
At the same time, Feige reminded that Sony is creating its own cinematic universe, built just around Spider-Man.
"It so happens that he is the only superhero with superpowers who finds himself in different film universes.
So as Sony continues to develop its own Spider-Universe, the future may bring unexpected surprises.”
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted on his Instagram account an excerpt from the film “The Wolf of Wall Street”, in which the hero Leonardo DiCaprio cries “I am not leaving!”
Information about the contradictions between the companies appeared in August.
As reported by the media, Disney wanted to receive half of the cash proceeds from the films about Spider-Man on condition that both companies will pay half of the costs of production of the paintings.
But that didn’t work for Sony.
The news of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has caused anger among many loyal fans.
Details of the new terms have not yet been disclosed.
Sony declined to comment on the deal, but said: “We’ve worked well together over the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many of our [Spider-Man] fans.
We are happy to be able to move forward together.”
The film "Avengers: Finale", which brought together Spider-Man, Thor, the Hulk and other superheroes of Marvel, became the highest-grossing in the history of world cinema, moving from the first place "Avatar".

Oleg Vinnik hit the base "Peacemaker": what happened
Popular Ukrainian singer Oleg Vinnik, who starred in the project #AllWorld with Russian stars who supported the Kremlin’s policy towards Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, got into the base of the “Peacemaker”.

The expert told why it is worth giving up tea in bags
A team of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that when you brew a tea bag in a cup in five minutes, more than ten billion microplastic particles get into it.
Sawdust particles may also be added to the packaged drink, said Nation News food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova.
According to the agronomist, the consumer can not get reliable information about the composition of packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be listed on the package.
Sawdust is not thrown away at the end of the season, so it can end up in tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in the bags," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to abandon the use of such a drink in favor of weight tea, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles are heated to high temperatures, because of which they can begin to emit harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - in this drink there will be the least additives," - said the expert.

Regions invited to share secrets of business support
On September 27, Andrei Kutepov, Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express a position on initiatives of the subjects of the Federation to improve legislation in the field of support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It is time to establish interregional ties
The Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions about the programs of business development and legalization of self-employed people, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve existing legislation.
"Today, communication between the regions is not sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit by senators has indicated the lack of information about regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole," Andrei Kutepov said.
In the annex to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and consolidated data from the regions with proposals and issues (available to the editorial board).
In addition to the relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on the positively implemented developments in the regions could give an impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step to such an exchange will be to forward the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” the senator told Parliament’s newspaper.
Useful experience
Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully operate support programs for small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, in the Vologda region there is a Center for Entrepreneurship Support, which, in addition to financial support measures, helps businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a system of business support has been developed, providing for the implementation of the single window principle through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar Territory, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are granted grants at the expense of the regional budget.
In the Orel region there is a cluster development center.
The Amur region within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises" provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state coworking centers at the expense of the federal budget.
And in a number of other regions, special support measures for youth entrepreneurship are being taken.
Self-employed continue to be driven out of the shadows
In the opinion of the regional authorities, a number of changes to the existing legislation should be made to better support small and medium-sized enterprises.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term “self-employment” with “entrepreneurial activity”, since this “most corresponds to the content of the state service for the promotion of self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to make amendments providing for the expansion of the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for finishing and repairing residential premises, summer cottages, physical training classes.
Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury".
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions advocate for the consolidation in the regulatory and legal field of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the directions of support for social entrepreneurship.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific draft laws," Kutepov said.

As indicated in the report, the volumes of prohibited imports were compensated by the increase in imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia and Serbia.
At the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited for import into Russia as part of counter-sanctions.
The document, posted on the official portal of legal information, noted that the validity of the rules was extended for one more year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the effect of the decree on the abolition of sanctions extended to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein and from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine "joined" this list.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported “sanctions” (products that fell under the food embargo, which Moscow imposed in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government allowed the destruction of “sanctioned” food by any legal means.
As Western sanctions continued, Russia also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, products that citizens import for personal use are not covered by this measure.
The ban does not apply to the importation of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation for the development of civil society and human rights Mikhail Fedotov previously called the destruction of food “simply immoral”, and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.
Moreover, the initiative to prohibit the destruction of food suitable for consumption was launched by Rospotrebnadzor in early June.
After that, a similar recommendation to the government was made by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
And Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Alexey Gordeev said that it is wrong to destroy food, and we need to think about how you can use them for their intended purpose, assessing the quality.

In Chile began to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
The construction of the dome of the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope) building has officially begun this week, the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomy project so far, according to ESO.
Its total value is estimated by ESO to exceed one billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT get the first detailed pictures of planets outside the Solar System, stars in other galaxies, and also search for Earth's counterparts.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has just begun, mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total cost was about 400 million euros, was received by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
