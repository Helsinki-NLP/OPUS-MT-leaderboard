Members of the Welsh Assembly do not want to “look like Muppets”
Among some members of the National Assembly, there is a growing dissatisfaction with the proposal to adopt the abbreviation MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament) for their name.
The problematic solution is related to the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One Labour member, expressing his party’s opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “rhymes Twp and Pwp.”
For our readers not from Wales: in Welsh twp means “stupid” and pwp means “cock”.
According to a Member of the Assembly from the Welsh Party, his organization as a whole “remained dissatisfied” and proposed other options.
Representatives of the Conservative party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that the MWP is close in spelling to the word Muppet (muppet).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced roughly as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently drafting a bill on the change of name, made the following statement: “The final decision on the names of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be left to them.”
The Welsh Governance Act of 2017 empowers the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the “Parliament of Wales” option instead of the “Assembly” found widespread support among the local population.
As for the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while the MWP option received the greatest public support.
Apparently, the members of the Assembly offer other options, but it will be difficult for the Chairman, Elin Jones, to find a satisfactory solution for everyone. Recall that the draft law on changes should be presented in a few weeks.
The reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly ' s workflow, including new rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and the structure of the Committee ' s system.
The members of the Assembly will vote on the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote on the renaming of the country as the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has repeatedly spoken out against its northern neighbor joining the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he was not going to recognize its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the name of the country is only the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The crisis in the Harlem parishes: forever silenced the bells of St. Martin
“The elders in the neighborhood I spoke to said there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams says.
“Now there is neither.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
“The format of communication has changed.”
“The bar ceased to be a kind of living room of the whole district, where they came regularly.”
But as for the churches, what is worrying is that the funds received from the sale of assets will be short-lived, no matter what their leaders hope for. “Sooner or later they will be left with nothing.”
On the site of the church, he added, there will be an apartment building, whose tenants are unlikely to support the parishes preserved in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams said, “and this will bring closer the day when such churches will finally close, because new neighbors will never become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black district: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church 10 years later.
The first parishioners of the Methodist church left the parish in the 30s of the last century.
Their building was bought by a black parish located next door.
When St. Martin's Church was taken over by the black community, it was led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of stores on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, where blacks were refused employment or promotion.
In 1939, as a result of a fire, the building received significant damage, and during the reconstruction work, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the installation of a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, who succeeded him at the head of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "bells for the poor."
But an expert who tried the carillon in July called it a “cultural heritage” and a “unique historical tool.”
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the carillon from St. Martin's Church that was the world's first instrument of its kind, played by the black musician, Dionisio A. Lind. 18 years ago he was invited to play a larger carillon in Riverside Church.
According to Merryweather, the church of St. Martin has not yet found a replacement for him.
In the past few months, the situation around St. Martin’s Church has been complicated with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by secular leaders of the church, others by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, appealed to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to shift the cost of the works” to the parish assembly, although the latter had nothing to do with the choice of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark wounded 13-year-old diver, fishing for lobster
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, in California, a 13-year-old diver was attacked by a shark and sustained bodily injuries.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV (San Diego) that he was diving with his friends on Saturday morning and about half an hour later he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with his friends, they sailed on a boat to the site of the attack and pulled the teenager out of the water.
According to Hummel, at first he decided that the boy was loudly happy to catch the lobster, but quickly "fell that he shouted "I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
Swimming to the diver, Hammel noticed that “he had completely torn skin around his collarbone.”
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, ‘Here’s a shark!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital (San Diego); his condition is assessed as critical.
The species of shark that attacked the teenager is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago but had not been identified as a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack suffered injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities blocked the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure public safety.
Giles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to conquer the perfume and cosmetics market of the UK
Sainsbury is going to install cosmetics and perfumery departments at Boots, SuperDrag and Debenhams stores with consultants in cosmetology, modeled on luxury department stores.
The UK perfume and cosmetics market is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to expand, while in the fashion and home goods sector, sales are falling. To capture a significant share of this coveted market as an experiment in 11 stores across the country, the spacious departments of cosmetics and perfumery will be presented, and if successful next year they should be expected in many other stores.
Supermarket owners are looking for something to fill the shelves previously reserved for televisions, microwaves, household goods, and investments in the perfume and cosmetics market seem to be a good solution.
According to representatives of Sainsbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic products to 3,000 items, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing assortment from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by the type of organization of goods in Boots stores.
In addition, the branded line of products “Boutique-cosmetics” with the transition to products for vegans will be reorganized to meet the needs of young buyers.
Two of Sainsbury’s stores will feature fragrance stalls from Fragrance Shop: the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second is expected to open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, this year.
E-commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of food every day in small shops near home have led to supermarkets being forced to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, Sainsbury’s president, says the outlets will gradually turn into department stores, and his supermarket chain is battling buyers in competition with low-cost stores like Aldy and Lidl, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of Sainsbury’s supermarkets house Argos outlets, and some of them have now found Habitats stores since the chain acquired both brands two years ago. This has led to increased food sales and revenue from these acquisitions.
Previous attempts of the supermarket to give a new life to its cosmetics and pharmacy departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture was organized between Sainsbury and Boots, but in the future there were disagreements between the participants on the issue of sharing income from sales of pharmacy products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of Sainsbury's pharmaceutical business (a total of 281 stores) to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a broad line of luxury skincare products from La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We have completely transformed the look and feel of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more conducive environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to help with advice.
Our range of brands for every taste, pleasant design and convenient location of shops will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumes. It will be a completely new concept of shopping trip. "
Peter Jones ‘angry’ at Holly Willoughby’s <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
The star of the show “Dragon’s Lair” Peter Jones is “enraged” by the exit of TV presenter Holly Willoughby from the deal for 11 million pounds, which she intended to conclude with the lifestyle brand Peter, but instead preferred new contracts with “Marx and Spencer” and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their joint homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The couple’s business was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of the program “This Morning” announced her decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby’s decision to leave their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Lair.
According to our sources, Jones was “enraged” when the TV viewer’s favorite during a tense meeting held Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after signing new contracts worth up to 1.5 million, she would not have enough time for their overall brand of Truly homewear and accessories.
Their brand was compared to the creation of actress Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop, and its sales were expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
The 37-year-old host announced her departure on Instagram, while Jones himself left the UK on a private jet in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “The Truly brand was Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure its carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Its decision has stuporized all the parties to the transaction.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, because there were a few weeks before the launch of the brand.
There is an entire warehouse at Marlowe HQ filled with ready-to-sell items.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host “This Morning”, one of the most popular stars of the UK, can cost the firm millions of pounds due to significant investments in goods: from pillows and candles to clothes, as well as a potential delay in the start of the line.
In addition, it is a rupture of long-standing friendships.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby created the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara’s husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, took over the company’s board in March.
The two couples often spend their vacations together, and Jones also owns 40% of Dan Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become an M&S ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as host of ITV’s “I’m a Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: “We cannot comment on his commercial affairs.”
Difficult negotiations, “and then we fell in love”
He joked about being criticized by the media because of the “unworthy president” comment and positive assessment of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
“I have not given up on anything.”
He noted that Kim Jong-un is interested in a re-meeting after Trump called their first summit in Singapore in June a significant step towards reducing North Korea’s nuclear weapons stockpile.
But the denuclearization talks have come to a standstill.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, a senior North Korean diplomat, Lee Yong-ho, spoke to world leaders at a UN General Assembly meeting on Saturday, saying North Korea was still waiting for “appropriate retaliation” from the United States after the DPRK’s initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the US, the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
During his supporters’ meeting, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“Things are going great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un have borne fruit: the missile tests have ended, hostages have been released, and the remaining US troops have also returned to their homeland.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Jong Un, Trump stressed that there is nothing strange in his unusual approach to diplomacy.
“Behaving like a president is so easy, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street rushing into this completely crowded hall, there would be only 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: recorded catastrophic destruction, the deaths of hundreds
In the first days after the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population had lost a roof over their heads, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which was a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have clearly made it clear that they do not need international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to be sent to Palu, but we do not yet know whether the foreign team will be able to work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, the Indonesian leadership is carrying out an assessment of the situation in Palu in order to determine the feasibility of involving international organizations.
Given the ongoing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country is still terribly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although shelters from the tsunami have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite the warning of a tsunami threat, Palu did not include a siren to alert the population, which is likely to have resulted in so many casualties.
Transportation between the numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital previously moored in Lombok to assist earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but the journey to the site of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made the strengthening of Indonesia’s old infrastructure the main focus of his election campaign and spent countless funds on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is running for a new term next year, has been mired in funding problems.
The president has also been criticized for escalating sectarian animosity between Indonesia’s conservative Muslim majority and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands more lost their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, arrow bows and other crossbows.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge compares the score in the match against Chelsea by a goal in the far upper corner of the goal
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the 89th minute of the Premier League match against Chelsea, held on Saturday at Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal when his team lost 1-0.
He moved to the left and broke into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and found itself in the far upper corner of the grid.
Goalkeeper Kepa Arrisabalaga jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Sturridge said: “It was all about being in that position and getting the ball, players like Shaq are always playing the attack to the maximum, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible.”
"I saw that Kante was coming towards me, took possession of the ball and, without thinking for a short time, broke through the goal."
At the end of the first half of the match, the team of Chelsea led with a score of 1-0, the goal in the 25th minute scored Belgian Eden Hazard.
Chelsea's central striker, passing back to Mateo Kovacic, broke through the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
In the middle of the field, Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> played a one-touch game.
Then he passed the pass to Azar, who went out to the gate.
Hazard overtook the defense and from the left flank struck bypassing Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker, hitting the far corner of the grid.
"Liverpool" will meet the team of "Napoli" in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at the stadium "San Paolo" in Naples (Italy) on Wednesday at 15:00.
"Chelsea" will play with the club "Videoton" in the match of the UEFA Euroleague, which will be held on Thursday in London, also at 15:00.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the National Disaster Management Authority said on Sunday morning.
According to reports, under the ruins of buildings destroyed as a result of an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale, many people remain. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused a tsunami with waves up to 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Office during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000 people, was overwhelmed by the wreckage of collapsed houses.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of inflicting fatal knife wounds on a woman
A woman's body was found this morning in the town of Birkenhead, Merseyside, and a murder investigation is underway.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 in the complex Grayson Mews on John Street. On suspicion of murder arrested 32-year-old man.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder among local residents.
O’Hagen said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I strongly urge anyone who has been in the John Street area of Birkenhead and may have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured something on the DVR. Please contact us with any information that may help the investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the victim lived in Birkenhead and her body was found in the complex.
This afternoon, alleged acquaintances of the victims arrived at the scene to ask their questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway, and police are preparing to report the tragedy of the victim's closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in the Grayson Mews complex, tried to enter his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he heard about it, he lost the ability to speak.
Residents were told that they would not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One police officer told the occupant that the entire surrounding area was considered a crime scene.
One woman cried.
“What a horror!” she repeated.
At 2 p.m., two police buses arrived at the scene, and another remained outside the fenced area.
Several policemen were placed inside the fence to watch the apartment complex.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a private message to <0x40>MerPolCC on Twitter, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 (case 247 of 30 September).
Cromwell's monument in front of parliament sparks heated debate over 'rewriting history'
Cromwell's "exile" would be a well-deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of the numerous cultural and religious artifacts of England by his followers, the Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “madness” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “As part of the ongoing debate about the demolition of historical monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace has inevitably arisen.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconoclastic movement during the English Civil Wars.
Oliver Cromwell probably suffers for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent Cromwell statue by Sir William Hamo Tornicroft reflects the opinion of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man who is still considered by many to be worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith said: "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case a monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of debate among experts.
But it is safe to say that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century influenced the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this partition.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also to be commended and respected.”
A Chinese farmer was bitten to death by a murderous pig
In one of the markets of southwestern China, the farmer was the victim of a pig, according to local media.
The victim's bloodied body (only his last name is mentioned in the media, "Yuan") with a ruptured artery was found next to a barn at a market in the Lupanshui district of Guizhou province in southern China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to introduce vaccinations to pigs at the pig farm, May 30, 2005, Xinqing district of the Chinese province of Qinghai.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, his cousin discovered Yuan’s breathless body, with the door to the neighboring pigsty open.
In the pigsty there was a huge hare with blood on his throat.
During the forensic examination, it was found that a pig weighing 250 kilograms bit the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs were bloodied and maimed,” Guiyang Evening News newspaper quoted Wu as saying.
Video from surveillance cameras showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig did not belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the pig was isolated in a separate detachment for the duration of the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
The Yuan family is reportedly negotiating with the market administration about compensation for the farmer’s death.
Pig attacks on humans are infrequent.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal nailed a Welsh peasant to a tractor and let him go, only frightened by his wife.
In 2012, there was a case when a farmer from Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs. As one Canadian farmer told CBC News, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their latent aggression as a "trigger".
“Pigs are playful,
They are biting and very curious, but they have no purpose to offend you.
You just have to instill in your animals a sense of proportion and respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rose will bring heavy rains to much of the southwestern United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves through a zone with cooler water to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring rains and floods to northern Mexico and southwestern United States.
As of Saturday morning at 5 a.m. in New York City, the cyclone reached Category 1 with winds of up to 135 km/h, being 360 km southwest of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the west coast of the United States. Approaching the coast of the state of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico to the territory of the southwest of the United States.
More than 25 cm of rain is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Under the influence of tropical humidity, falling into the emerging low-pressure zone, heavy rains are expected in the South-West in the coming days.
Precipitation from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous rainstorms, mudstone streams and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to the high tropical humidity, the rate of precipitation can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some areas of the southwestern United States, mainly in most of Arizona, up to 5–10 cm of precipitation is expected.
The risk of sudden rapidly developing floods due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
With the risk of tropical rain, hiking in the desert has serious consequences.
Rains can turn canyons into turbulent rivers, and thunder can cause gusty winds in places and lift clouds of dust.
With the emergence of a low-pressure zone in places on the coast of southern California rains will fall.
It is possible that up to 1.5 cm of precipitation will fall, which can cause small mudstone streams and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall since the start of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evening and Monday morning in Arizona places will be tropical rains, which will spread to other territories by the evening of Monday and the morning of Tuesday.
By Tuesday, the rains will pass in the area of Four Corners and will last until the evening of Wednesday.
In October, there will be sharp temperature changes throughout the United States, due to low temperatures in the Arctic at fairly high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes this combination leads to strong temperature changes in a small area.
Such sharp temperature changes will be especially noticeable in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
Between the temperatures in Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
Warm weather is expected in most central and eastern U.S. territories in early October, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees Celsius in the South Plains to the Northeast.
In New York on Tuesday, air temperatures could rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast is likely to promise unusually high temperatures on the U.S. East Coast until mid-October.
The Senate hearings in the case of Judge Brett Kavanaugh watched more than 20 million viewers
The testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blazy Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, caught the attention of more than 20 million viewers on six TV channels on Thursday.
The political confrontation over Kavanaugh’s candidacy’s approval has received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, an urgent message was sent to the media: Republican Jeff Flake put forward a condition that the charges against the lawyer should be investigated by the FBI within one week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was "100 percent sure" that Kavanaugh attacked her intoxicated and tried to strip her at a school party.
Kavanaugh gave emotional testimony, stating that he was 100 percent sure that this was not the case.
According to the Nielsen research agency, Friday’s debate was watched by more than 20.4 million viewers.
The agency took into account average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures for other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, the Nielsen rating does not always take into account viewers watching TV at work.
For comparison: we are talking about the average audience watching a game of American football in the playoffs or the Oscars ceremony.
The largest audience was with Fox News Channel, whose hosts warmly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment: the Senate hearings, which lasted all day, watched an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS's audience was 3.1 million, NBC's 2.94 million, MSNBC's 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, Nielsen reported.
After the hearing, interest in the case did not weaken.
On Friday, there was a real drama with Jeff Flake.
After the Arizona senator, considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support the candidacy of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS managed to capture on camera how Friday morning on the way to the meeting of the Legal Committee Flake encountered in the elevator a group of activists who criticized the senator.
The whole world saw him, lowering his eyes, get a kick out of angry women live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” one of them said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“You have the power, while so many women are powerless,” they tried to explain their position.
Flake told the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak on this topic at a committee meeting. The elevator doors closed, hiding the senator from the ubiquitous cameras.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the post of judge and send it to the Senate for a general vote, all the TV channels broadcast the meeting live.
Flake made one condition, however, that the FBI should investigate the allegations against the candidate by next week, as the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake claims he changed his mind thanks to the intervention of a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
He made the final decision after talking to Koons and several other senators.
Flake's decision was effective, as it was obvious that the Republicans lacked the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
By order of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses her critics of 'political games' over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians criticizing her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow party interests ahead of public interests.
The British Prime Minister arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another one-strip interview with May, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Brexit plan, saying that he considers the imposition of tariffs between the UK and the EU “absolutely ridiculous”.
The death of Wade Sims in a shootout: the police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of murder of the forward of the University of Louisiana
Police have arrested a man suspected of murder in a shootout with Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for Louisiana State University.
According to the Baton Rouge police, 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder.
The police released a video of a fight involving Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, a regional CBS channel, police found Simpson’s DNA on glasses found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he fatally wounded Wade.
According to Advocate, a $350,000 bail is set for Simpson.
The coroner of the eastern district of Baton Rouge on Friday issued a preliminary conclusion: the death was caused by a cross-cutting combined gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division is grateful to the Louisiana Police Department of Criminal Investigation, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the locals who assisted in the operational search activities that led to the detention.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at Louisiana State University, thanked law enforcement for their “good work to catch the criminal.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-meter forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played for the Louisiana State University team.
Last season, Sims scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds on average per match.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying Wade Sims' tragic death caused "shock" and "real grief" for all players.
“That’s what I’ve always feared,” the coach added.
The volcano covered the ashes of Mexico City
The volcano Popocatepetl covered the southern neighborhood of the Mexican capital with ashes.
On Saturday, the National Center for Natural Disaster Prevention of Mexico advised the population not to approach the volcano: its crater was registered activity and produced 183 gas emissions per day.
According to the observations of the Center, near the volcano there was often a rumble and trembling.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilco, social media users posted photos of car windshields covered in a thin layer of ash.
After a magnitude 7.1 Mw earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded increased volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the capital.
Popocatepetl Volcano (or, for its own sake, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists ahead of the first anniversary of independence referendum
On Saturday in Barcelona held a multi-thousandth rally dedicated to the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which split the country into two camps. Not without clashes between supporters of independence of the autonomy and the police; six participants of the riots were detained.
Police officers pushed back the independence protesters, while the latter, dressed in black masks, threw eggs and powder paint at the security guards, raising clouds of dark dust in the heart of Barcelona.
After police fired batons to deter the crowd, the riots resumed with renewed force.
For several hours, supporters of independence chanted: “We will not forget, we will not forgive!”, and their opponents responded with the slogan: “Long live Spain!”.
According to local press reports, fourteen protesters were hospitalized with minor injuries.
On October 1, last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain. It was recognized as illegal by the Spanish government, but it was an important milestone for the separatists. A year later, tensions remain in the region seeking sovereignty.
Catalonia overwhelmingly voted to leave Spain, but turnout was low due to the fact that opponents of the exit mostly boycotted the referendum.
Catalan officials say nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to block a referendum at the country’s polling stations.
On Friday, the separatists spent the night on the declared path of a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration took place, but took a different route.
68-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who attended a separatist rally in the company of his wife, laments that the hope of Catalonia's acquisition of sovereignty is becoming increasingly shaky.
“Last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents wept with happiness when they were given the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a state of suspense,” he said.
In the recent local government elections in December, Catalan parties advocating secession from Spain have won an important victory, albeit with a small margin. However, this year their movement is losing supporters, as many of the well-known leaders of the movement are either on the run or in custody, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a rally in support of the police on the phone, said the conflict was being heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The tension is growing,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of Catalan separatists in custody since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participating in the next European Parliament election as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the homes in Londonberry was hit by a car several times; the men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested.
The raid was carried out on Thursday around 19:30 local time in the Ballinagard Crescent area.
As a result, the ram damaged the gate and the building itself, according to the inspector of the criminal police Bob Blemmings.
There are reports that a bow shot may have been fired into the car.
The victory of “Livingston” over “Rangers” thanks to a goal Menga
The first goal of Dolly Menghi brought a guaranteed victory to the team "Livingston"
With the goal scored, Livingston scored an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerrard, this is only the second defeat in 18 games.
A precise hit by Dolly Menghi tied Gary Holt's team to Hibernian in the standings, where they split second.
Gerrard's club was left without a victory on the road this season of the Premier League. On Sunday they will meet with the leaders of the group, "Harts", from which "Rangers" are behind by eight points.
On Thursday, the Rangers will hold a Europa League match against Austrian club Rapid (Vienna).
The Livingston club continues its win-win series in the division, having played six games and not received a single defeat since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as head coach of the team.
Missed moments for “Livingston” in a fight with assertive guests
Coach Holt's wards should have kept the score from the start - the Rangers clearly did not cope with their pressure.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the defensive line, but the goal from his weak attempt did not come out. Then defender Alan Litgow, swinging too wide, could not prevent the ball of Kage Halkett to get into the net.
The host side allowed the Rangers to play in front of their line of defense, counting on dangerous moments when the game resumed.
That’s how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers conceded a free kick, and Livingston took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made the transfer to Menge, who scored from the central position.
At the time, the Rangers had superior possession of the ball, but the defense of the host team was impenetrable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second half continued in the same pattern, although Kelly still had to repel the blow from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked the ball away from Scott Pittman, and Litgow made a wide serve from the standard position.
The balls constantly hit the penalty area of “Livingston”, but all attacks were repelled, and two penalties requirements – one for provoking the reserve player Glenn Middleton Hulkett and the second for the hand – were not satisfied.
Livingston's "phenomenal" game - analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alasdair Lamont, a report from the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for the team “Livingston”.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their ascent to the football Olympus.
Their style of play and line-up has hardly changed since their ascent to the top of the rankings, and the great merit of coach Holt is that he mobilized this team from the very beginning.
He had a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halkett led the brilliantly organized defense, and Meng did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
At the same time, the Rangers could not get into the rhythm.
“Although they had some good moments with coach Gerrard, this time they didn’t live up to our expectations.
In the last minutes of the match, they lacked possession of the ball, and they managed to pass the defense of the host team only once. The Rangers, which fell to the middle of the table, have something to think about.
Cool reception of Erdogan during his visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, the weather was fine and both senior figures were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s visit to Germany to rebuild relations between the two NATO member states, a visit already fraught with some conflicts.
The heads of state failed to find an understanding on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to take part in the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police prevented a 25,000-strong crowd from entering the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters settled nearby to see their president.
In the same place, opponents of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered to condemn both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to visit Germany.
The presence of radically opposite views at the meeting reflects the ambiguous nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots praise Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford road accident: collision with a car resulted in the death of a cyclist
In London, the car collided with a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy intersection in the southeastern part of the city of Deffort, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the paramedics who arrived at the scene tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without regaining consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just one and a half kilometers from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car, the driver of which fled.
The London police reported that work is currently underway to identify the deceased and notify his immediate family.
Meanwhile, at the scene of the incident, roads were blocked and the route of buses was changed: motorists were asked not to come to the area.
Riots at Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured
According to the Long-Lartin administration, six police officers were injured in the riots in the men ' s high-security prison.
In the men's high-security prison of Long-Lartin (Woostershire) since Sunday, the riots continued, starting at about 09:30 local time.
The Tornado task force was called in to suppress the riots involving eight inmates from one wing.
The policemen sustained minor injuries to the soft tissues of the face; they were treated on the spot.
According to a prison official, “specially trained staff were recruited to resolve the incident at the Long Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We strongly condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their preventive measures may be changed for a longer period.”
There are currently more than 500 detainees in Long Larthing, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager was hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, prison officials were forced to recruit special forces to calm the raging inmates who threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rose Could Flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (Which Will Benefit Drylands)
Arizona seldom falls into the zone of passage of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time she is “lucky”: at the beginning of next week, Hurricane Rosa, having made the last leap, should pass over the desert part of the South-West and bring with it the risk of heavy flooding.
The National Weather Service has already warned of the threat of heavy rains on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rose is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and spill rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service’s Office in Phoenix said on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression, being within a 320 km radius of Phoenix, since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Meteorological Service, there will be from 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, at times reaching 15 cm on the Arizona Mogollon-Rome plateau.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, there may be up to 2.5–5 cm of precipitation, with places of precipitation reaching 10 cm.
For areas that will be bypassed by heavy rains, the rain brought by Hurricane Rose can be a real blessing, because the region has long suffered from drought.
Although heavy rains can pose a danger, heavy rains can alleviate the arid season not taking place in the Southwestern United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least severe drought (the second most severe category),” according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rose will hit the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, which has a top speed of 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane found itself in a zone with cooler water on the Pacific coast and thus loses its power.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
Heavy downpours are expected to occur in some parts of Mexico, with the risk of flooding.
"From Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, there can be up to 7-10 cm of rainfall, in places up to 25 cm," the weather.com website reports.
Next, Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico and early Tuesday morning will reach the border with Arizona in the category of tropical cyclone. From Arizona, it will reach the southern part of Utah by Tuesday evening.
"The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rose and its remnants is associated with heavy rains in Lower California, in the northwestern part of Sonora and in desert areas of the southwestern United States," the National Weather Service said.
Rainfall is expected to cause dangerous downpours, mudstone streams in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: arrested four suspects in attempted murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old teenager was severely stabbed. Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim of the attack with serious injuries was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 am on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as "stable".
The same night, four suspects, aged 17, 18 and 20, were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset County police said.
The police are looking for possible witnesses of the crime, who have any video recordings of what happened on a mobile phone.
Donald Trump: “All the hatred, all the anger of the Democrats have fallen on Kavanaugh”
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, in the process of confirming Kavanaugh’s nomination, the candidate “collapsed all the hatred, all the malice” of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before the U.S. Congress, in his emotional address categorically rejecting Christina Blaze Ford's accusation that he sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago when they were both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during her indictment hearing.
On Saturday, the US president said that the day “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh’s approval is a vote for the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an unblemished state record,” the president told a crowd of his associates in West Virginia.
In his speech, the president implicitly raised the issue of Kavanaugh’s nomination, referring to the importance of Republican turnout for the elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“The most important elections in our lives are only five weeks away.
I don’t participate in them, but I participate in the race in a different sense,” he said.
“I’m wearing out and fighting for our great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats had set themselves the task of "resisting to us with all their might."
According to the rules, the first key vote in the Senate on the confirmation of Kavanaugh’s candidacy should take place no later than Friday, said the assistant of a high-ranking representative of the Republican Party.
The earthquake in Indonesia claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people were killed, many carried away by giant waves that seized the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which was hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the disaster were hundreds of guests of the beach festival in the city of Palu. On Friday at sunset, the coast caught up with waves almost six meters high, which dared everyone in their path and led to the instant death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach holidays instead of immediately fleeing to shelter and lost their lives because of it,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Authority, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come one thing, in the stream of water there were cars, logs, whole houses, the element destroyed everything in its path," Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km / h and with all the force it hit the coast.
Some of those present climbed the trees, which saved their lives.
Approximately 16,700 locals were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
Aerial photographs of the Disaster Management Office show destroyed houses, shops, collapsed bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by tremors.
A series of earthquakes occurred in a territory with a population of 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPTT) said the earthquake-induced energy emissions were about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
Perhaps the tsunami was stronger than expected due to the geographic location of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “extensive,” adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the bodies of the dead were found; a total of 540 people were injured, and another 29 are missing.
Nugroho added that the casualties and destruction could be even more significant along the coast around 300 km from Palu, in the town of Dungala, which was closer to the epicentre of the quake.
Communications from Dungala were “completely destroyed, no information was received.”
“More than 300,000 people live in the Dungala area,” the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement.
“A tragedy has occurred, but this is not the limit,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized for not reporting on time about the tsunami in Palu. Authorities, however, believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
An amateur video has appeared on social media, in which a man on the top floor of a building shouts about an impending tsunami, desperate to attract the attention of people on the street.
After a few minutes, a wall of water collapses on the shore, taking whole houses and cars with them.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a major immobilization of the electrical lines, which caused the connection to Palu to be lost. This made it very difficult for the rescue operations of the services.
Military transport aircraft with humanitarian aid were sent from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated population still lacks food and basic necessities, government sources said.
The city's airport was only open for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
Volunteers of the World Vision charity arrived safely from Dungala to Palu, where employees found shelter in tarpaulin tents smashed in the courtyard of their office building. According to Doseba Sinai, on the way their eyes appeared a terrible picture of complete destruction.
“They saw a huge number of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charitable organizations have started to put humanitarian aid mechanisms in place, but many complain that experts from international NGOs have failed to get to Palu.
Indonesian law permits the attraction of funding, humanitarian aid and staff of foreign organizations only after the disaster has been declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed that this is a local disaster,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government declares a natural disaster national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but for now the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that shook Palu, friends and relatives of the people counted missing still hope for their miraculous salvation, which will restore the population's faith in the best.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued who fell into a sewer hatch.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman from under the wreckage of the building, who spent two days there, next to her mother’s breathless body.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian paragliding coach, has prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s emotionally difficult to get through,” he said.
Gandon recalls how, after learning of the collapse of Roa Roa's hotel from other paragliders, over the next hours he desperately tried to get in touch via WhatsApp with his Palu colleagues vacationing at the beach festival.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray tick, not two blue ones.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Brave theft of $26,750 while servicing an ATM in Newport-on-Leavy
On Friday morning, attackers stole $26,750 from a Brink's collector operating one of the ATMs in the city of Newport-on-Leavy, according to a Newport police press release.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored minibus was picking up cash from an ATM located in the entertainment complex and was going to fill it with new banknotes.
At this time, “an intruder ran to an employee of Brink’s from behind” and stole a bag of banknotes to refuel an ATM.
Witnesses reported that several suspects had fled the scene, but the police did not specify the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information about these individuals are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Yea
Kanye West has a new name for himself: Yee.
On Saturday, he tweeted, “The person formerly known as Kanye West.”
41-year-old West has long worn this nickname and even put it in the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news came ahead of Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to release his new album Yandhi.
Kanye West will act as a co-host in place of singer Ariana, who canceled her participation due to “emotional experiences”, the author of the program reports.
West has previously stated that the pseudonym is not only an abbreviated version of his name, but also carries a religious meaning.
“Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means ‘you,’ ‘you,’” West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with radio host Big Boy.
I mean, I am you, I am us.
First there was Kanye, which means “the only one,” and now I am only Ye, that is, a reflection of everything good, bad, incomprehensible in us, everything at once.
And the album is an attempt to understand who we are.”
Kanye is not the first rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or just Diddy, asked this year to call himself Love or Braza Love.
Jay-Z, who performed with West, also changed the spelling of his name several times: with and without hyphens, capital letters or lowercase.
Mexican President vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador vowed never to resort to military force against civilians ahead of the 50th anniversary of a student demonstration that ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, President López Obrador vowed “never to resort to the help of the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired at the crowd and a massacre began, killing 300 people. This was taking place against the backdrop of the strengthening of leftist student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also pledged support for Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and the opening of more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of prospects for education lead young people directly into the criminal world.
U.S. needs to double AI funding
China and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) should not be underestimated – the US should double its investment in its scientific development, according to Li Kaifu, an investor and entrepreneur in the field of AI development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Several U.S. ministries have previously announced work on AI, although the U.S. does not have a clear AI development strategy in general.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
“Twice the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we expect the next AI breakthrough,” Lee says.
An increase in funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book, “The Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the tallest player in American Othello, and then he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects’ Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place to help find people with unconventional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It is not China that absorbs academic leaders, but corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policies can also help the U.S. in developing artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should be automatically offered to artificial intelligence candidates,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Science Foundation allocates funding to scientists similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Li argues.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any action in this direction for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
Macedonia’s people on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia” to resolve a long-running dispute with Greece that has blocked its bids to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments struck an agreement based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia’s population.
President Gheorghe Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether voter turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required to hold the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was formulated as follows: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU on the condition of accepting a treaty with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining such organizations as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of parliament said they would respect the vote to make it decisive, although it is not legally binding.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority of the members of parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no reports of violations had been received by 13:00.
However, turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said Yose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko voted for a referendum in Macedonia on the name change, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene, placing chairs in front of tents installed by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with our heads held high, not beating the thresholds of official cabinets,” Kavadarkov said.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-worth.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring investments to Macedonia, which is so much needed by the country, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “the key to our prosperous future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, but that was below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telecom-TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote positively.
For the referendum to take place, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The referendum’s failure would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City bypasses the defense of Brighton to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling dealt with the defense of Brighton, leading Manchester City to a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored the goal in the 65th minute, it seemed that it did not make him any trouble.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field.
He sneaked between the three defenders of Brighton, before escaping into the open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green shirts.
He bypassed one defender and overtook several more on the edge of the penalty area “Brighton”.
He then handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English striker, being in the penalty area, in one touch returned the ball to Aguero, who with his right foot punched Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan into the right corner of the goal.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero got the ball while being deep inside Brighton.
He gave an excellent crossover on Leroy Sana's left flank.
Sané made a few touches before giving Sterling the transfer to the far rod.
The Sky Blue striker scored the ball in the goal just before he flew out of the field.
Manchester City clashed with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. at the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer is going to take his glasses from the Colorado Rockies
After the Washington Nationals dropped out of the playoffs, there was no reason to force the event.
But indefatigable Scherzer hopes to take the lead in the fight against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in one game in the Western Division, will start problems in the playoffs.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have already secured at least 7 or 8th place, but they still hope to secure the title in the first division.
“While we’re playing just like that, at least we can hold our ground, knowing the huge importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of spectators and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss this?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a pitcher for Sunday, but, according to the latest data, in the current situation, they tend to put Scherzer in this role.
Scherzer, who is going to go to the 34th game, on Thursday threw the ball on the pitch, and on Sunday, on his weekend, he will be a pitcher.
Washington's right-handed pitcher statistics are 18-7 with an ERA rating of 2.53 and 300 innings in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is running an election race in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the president implicitly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, the president’s candidacy for the Supreme Court.
“Everything we did was at stake in November.
Five weeks until one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s very, very important. I don’t run, although I really run, everywhere fighting for good candidates,” he said.
“You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, and we are witnessing vileness and abomination.
They don’t care who they offend, who they have to cross over to get power and control, and that’s what they want to get — power and control, but we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he argues, set themselves the goal of “resisting and obstructing.”
“And you’ve been watching this for the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “evil, mean, nasty and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, referring to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which caused loud exclamations from the hall.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the contents of this document?
Mmm... mmm... what document?
No, no. Body language has betrayed her, I have never seen body language refute words so much."
The Labour Party is no longer an organization with different views.
They are not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party put forward a motion of censure against me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last Labour Member of Parliament who has not yet been told that we are not welcomed for expressing our opinion.
The same goes for my colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, because she spoke out strongly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, a no-confidence vote criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe – ironically, these are issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A notice to the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday said that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the time of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the evening GC Friday meetings were just like that.
Unfortunately, today’s tone does not correspond to those many meetings, and the promise of a “more humane and soft” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever was.
The fact that differences of opinion are not allowed within the Labour Party is becoming increasingly apparent, and each opinion is evaluated to see whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political outlook I previously considered similar to mine began to expect me to radically change my views and take positions that I would never agree with – whether national security issues or the EU’s single market.
Every time I make a public statement — and it doesn’t matter what I say — there’s a tirade of insults on social media calling for an election to be cancelled, condemning the center’s policies, or saying I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments addressed to me still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who face a flood of sexual or racist attacks every day, but never retreat.
What is most disappointing about this policy is that so many insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “broad church,” and with every vote of no confidence or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes already.
Over the past two years, I’ve received many recommendations urging me to sit quietly and speak less often, and then I’ll be fine.
But that’s not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a schoolboy outraged by the disregard of the Thatcher government, which literally broke up my schoolroom, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need them most—whether as a local deputy or a government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, nor did I do so in past elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have misinterpreted my political positions and areas in which I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say the following: Our country is having so much trouble moving towards a Brexit that is guaranteed to inflict economic, industrial and state damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of cancellation of the election results or political expediency will prevent me from acting in the way I deem necessary in your interests.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament from Nottingham East County
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible "Air" comes out in first place
The two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but without a doubt, Air has earned a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Premier League match of Tennant.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only invincible team of the dozen.
After all, all thanks to their excellent defense, as well as the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Murchy a full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested for strength all this time and we’re still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” said Peter Murchie.
Robin Christie, Melrose: “It’s worth paying tribute to Air, they did a better job than us.”
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, implemented by Fraser Klimo, brought Air forward, but a yellow card issued for the Warriors to Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to come forward, and Jason Baggott grabbed for an unrealized attempt.
Klimo increased Air's break from the penalty before, right in the middle of the game, earned a point, and then in the break he made a single attempt, making a score of 17-5 in favor of Air.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Buggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was then a long hiatus due to a serious injury to Roarid Knott, who had been stretched, and after re-release, Ear moved on thanks to Stafford McDowell's attempt by Klimo.
Acting Air captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced rivals to pay another player for the unrealized attempt of Bruce Colvin, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball from the penalty area, McPherson made a touchdown behind the approaching Air Mall.
Klimo realized the advantage, not stopping almost from the second exit, after Kyle Rowe received a blow from David Armstrong and sent the extreme striker Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the owners of the field.
The star of Still Game is going to start a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran is going to start working in the hotel industry: it became known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, the script of which he writes, and starred together with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth episode would be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, although a source at the Scottish Sun hinted that Kearnan was planning to take part in a “prosperous restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Our sea”: landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are displayed on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
“Giving it back is our duty.”
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile as a result of a bloody 19th-century conflict over resources is still alive; alive and striving to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes may have been the boldest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the international court, which will take place on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the energy, the spirit of unity and the mental balance and, of course, they are waiting for a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia's claim that, after decades of tense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president who is waging a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also eagerly awaiting a decision on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if it does, that will change little.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to control Chilean territory and has already said that it will have no influence on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice was delivered only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case “was not complicated,” says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
For the past four years, the Bolivian case has not progressed, but, on the contrary, it has been postponed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate said.
According to her, Morales’ bellicose rhetoric has destroyed Chile’s last benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss afterwards.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagrees that the court’s decision was made too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “put an end to 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he argues.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, uses the naval issue as a political trump card.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to reassure us that we need to step over our past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament until it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of its countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of resuming deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
The dream that long-term sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees is utopia.
Washington is afraid to approve the declaration unless Pyongyang takes significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest line of massive hats that promise to appear on mass sale, and they will be worn right next to you
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun's rays, there's no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual hats that are part of their SS19 collection and blinded visitors to the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, extremely impractical hats have won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and the designers decided to send their stunning creations to the podium.
A distinguished example of Valentino: a beige headdress, decorated with wide fields similar to feathers, appeared on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included jewel-decorated watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but all of these hats are not designed to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of quirky masks, which had to be very on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these variegated masks had a sewn mouth, and they looked more like a portrait of Hannibal Lecter than a creation from couture.
One of the specimens resembled scuba diving equipment with a tube and protective glasses, and the other - melted ice cream.
If you are a fan of high fashion, you are in luck.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance to break into mass sales - right to you.
Huge-sized hats follow the heels of La Bomba, a two-foot-wide straw hat that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult label that released this extremely impractical hat, which has gained such wide popularity on social networks, gave birth to and sent to walk on the podium another huge accessory - a straw beach bag, almost as big as the model herself dressed in a swimsuit, carrying this bag.
An orange burnt raffia bag with a white leather handle and a raffia edging became a vivid specimen of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: “I think big hats and beach bags will go on mass sale next summer. Since the designer has produced such a furor with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance for the citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was once again confirmed in 2018: outstanding exam results demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other socially significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are enrolled throughout Scotland, and where they strive to provide the highest level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers, as well as for the status of world citizens.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the design and implementation of individual school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you call on his mind.
If you speak to him in his native tongue, you turn to his heart.”
This is convincing evidence that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build relationships with citizens of other countries and be able to trust them.
According to the results of the last exams of this year, we see that the languages occupy a leading position in the league tables and have the highest score on the results of exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages received the highest grade “A”.
Data obtained from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of pupils received an “A” in Mandarin (Chinese dialect), while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also received an “A”.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Currently, language subjects are in the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill job vacancies, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession the student chooses, if he learns a second language, in the future he will gain a real advantage by mastering another additional skill that will be useful to him throughout his later life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit percentage – it was spoken by 15 percent of respondents.
That’s why investing in language education is so important right now.
Knowing several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In schools in Scotland, there is quite a wide variety in terms of the languages that are taught - each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in light of the country’s future development until 2020 – such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with a teaching staff whose members are experts in these languages.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages continue to be vital for the future development of the country, so this should be reflected appropriately in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits to Scotland’s youth.
It's going to be fair.
John Edwards, Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans’ waiting to see LeBron James perform at the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It remains to be seen how long he will have to play.
"More than one and less than forty-eight," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games in the Lakers schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” he said.
Trump campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five scheduled meetings next week, including a visit to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote on his nomination for supreme judge postponed, Trump is seeking support in the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote takes place in November.
What time will Trump meet in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting with West Virginia voters online on a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at a hearing this week to nominate his candidate Brett Kavanaugh for the post of supreme judge. Trump’s proposal for this candidacy has caused a lot of negative reactions, as Kavanaugh was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote, which was supposed to take place in the Senate, will be postponed by a week.
But the main goal of this action is to help the Republicans, coming out for the November elections, to increase the pre-election pace.
President Trump’s campaign is aimed at ensuring that these five meetings, due to take place next week, help “intensify volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters wrote.
“Control of Congress is so important to its agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible as we enter a tense campaign season,” said a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named.
Planned today at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the action can attract supporters from “...Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the media of Pittsburgh,” — reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia this Saturday is his second visit to the state in the past month, where he gained an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in polls.
“The fact that the president has to come before Morrisey’s competitors in polls is a bad sign for Morrisey himself,” says Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates willingness to fight and nourishes hopes, going to doubles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday’s two-on-two game may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The transitional initiative is an exceptionally invented sports concept, but it is in it that players believe, and in such competitions it is especially pronounced.
Who has the initiative?
“They had a six-point advantage and now four, so I guess it’s a little initiative for us,” Jordan said as he left.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points, and another twelve at stake.
Americans feel the “wind in the sails,” according to Spite, and they have reasons to keep the spirit up, not least because of the shape of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each boasts three points out of four.
Sleep was steadfast from ti to green, giving a personal example.
The victorious cries grew louder as his round continued, driving the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas conceded two-by-two.
His blow, which gave them the victory in the game on the 15th hole, was met with a similar exclamation, one that speaks of his faith in a chance for the American team.
“You have to concentrate with all your strength and focus only on your game,” said Spit.
That’s all the players have now.
Go through 18 holes and become the winners.
The only players to have scored more points than Sleep and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who have undoubtedly made Ryder Cup history.
A strange but charming couple from Europe knocked out four out of four, and they don’t seem to know the mistakes.
The Molywoods were the only couple not to score on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and, again, Friday mornings.
Such a series and the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the raging fans, strengthens the belief that even on Sunday they will not be defeated, and when the sun hides behind the horizon of the Le Golf National, there will be no more famous player who cemented the potential victory of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be great if they were both in different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly cracked down on Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Boggi and two double boggi in the first nine holes dug a hole for the Spaniard and the Swede, from which they could not get out.
So no one will help you get out of your hole on Sunday.
It’s so exciting to watch a four-ball and four-player game because of the interaction between the pairs, the tips they exchange and who deliberately keep silent, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and made a significant headway on the last day, but this session of the four also showed that the U.S. national team has all the strength to fight, which some, especially in America, doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with a score of 10-6
Europe will gain a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after completing Saturday’s four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight with two victories over wrestling Tiger Woods to bring the score to Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Björn's European team, which wants to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the mistaken American team in the morning games in four goals, winning with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. made more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the gap in the score.
Jim Ferric’s team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
Having defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in four goals, they then brilliantly teamed up to defeat the fallen Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechebmo with an even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who spent two Saturday matches, showed periodic flashes, but now he lost 19 of the 29 matches in four goals, and four - seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested before the morning four-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the four, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Capka with a score of 2/1, occupying the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game did not become an easy and pleasant walk a refreshing day southwest of Paris.
Earned three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday, two points became a landmark for Americans.
They earned a decisive 2/1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Polter in a four-ball game and returned later to beat Polter and Rory McIlroy with a 4/3 score in fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team come out of the four-point gap, leaving alone, given that Ferik's team, as the hosts, had to play a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not "categorically" disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions increase distrust of the United States and that his country will not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
Ri Yong-ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and committing not to build up nuclear weapons stockpiles or develop nuclear technology.
"But we are not seeing a symmetrical reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be able to unilaterally take disarmament action first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral unchecked denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ree cited a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the incumbent U.S. president and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on June 12; then Kim promised to start a move towards “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea seeks to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that ‘denuclearization must be done first,’ and is raising the level of pressure through sanctions to enforce its goal and even object to ‘declaration of war to end,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions are increasing our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: “If South Korea, rather than the United States, had been a party to this denuclearization issue, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been so deadlocked.”
However, Ri’s tone of speech differed sharply from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s missile targeting of the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “suicide missile.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his boldness in taking disarmament measures, but said there was more to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarms.
Trump said on Wednesday that he did not indicate any time frame for the process: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s imposition of sanctions should continue actively and imperatively until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, seeking to cut off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit and said after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea denounced him for “bandit demands.”
North Korea vowed at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States, for its part, takes “appropriate measures”.
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he talked about were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest on special courses
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, has helped all elementary students learn to sleep more and fight the chauvinistic culture of continuous caffeine intake with the goal of staying awake all night.
One academic found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he was enthralled by the idea of introducing such a course, having previously made a report on the impact of lack of sleep on learning processes.
“At the end of my talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘I’m so sorry I only found out about it now that I’m almost done.’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, tells how a healthy sleep habit promotes academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves a person’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Health Service, says the university decided to introduce this course after it was found that students experienced a severe lack of sleep during the school week.
The class lasts one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
One section of the class offers a picture of a dorm room where students, by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, simulators and books, get information about how each of these activities and substances - coffee, light, which cause lack of sleep - affect athletic performance, and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants will learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
An interactive campus map encourages course participants to reflect on their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just like any other person has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects their health,” added Professor Cheysler.
According to him, the false sense of pride that a person can “sniff all night” is still quite common, and modern technology, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
According to him, a sufficient amount of good quality sleep is a “secret weapon” of the student to fight stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to fight excess weight, since lack of sleep puts the brain in fasting mode, causing him to constantly experience a feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheysler design the course by attending one of the classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar curriculum before enrolling in a competitive educational institution.
Professor Chaysler recommends that students set an alarm clock to warn them to go to bed and wake up, as well as to remember about the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, which disrupts a person’s biorhythm and leads to problems falling asleep.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Goal Menga brings victory over the team Gerrard
The Rangers experienced another sad away match, as a goal of Dolly Meng led the untapped team of Steven Gerrard to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox team hoped to win their first away win after a 4–1 win in February at St Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only inflicted a second defeat on Gerrard out of 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving an easy victory to the Harts team, the leaders of the Scottish Prese.
Meng scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lost their spirits, did not seem to be going to level the score.
While the Rangers now dropped to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place, behind only Hibernian in goal ratio.
And the Rangers may have additional problems after linear judge Kalum Spence had to heal a wound on his head after an object was thrown from the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight replacements for the team that went through Air in the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
In turn, Holt went with the same Livy 11 strategy that widened the gap with the Harts last week, and he would have been delighted to see how his well-trained squad squeezed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have led in sword possession, but the Livingston squeezed a lot more when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to score a goal in just two minutes when Meng's first transmission to Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder took advantage of the opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs executed a penalty kick on team captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgow, only managed to send the ball to the far side of the bar.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was sure he should have hit the penalty kick in the forty-fifth minute when he and Stephen Lawless collided, but referee Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian's statement.
The Rangers made only two strikes in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned about Lassan Coulibaly's head shot, and Ovi Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livy’s first goal, scored in the 34th minute, may not have matched the game, no one can deny that they deserved it solely by their own work.
But again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs' game from a standard position.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to pass the ball to Meng for completion.
Gerrard began acting at a break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately yielded a result when the midfielder gave a pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed off his line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to draw guests into the game they conceived, featuring Lithgow and Hulkett, constantly making long broadcasts.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Lithgow gave the transmission from the corner of the field.
Rangers reserve Glenn Middleton once again demanded a penalty kick after he collided with Jacobs, but Thomson again refused.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now the page of our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Becoming one of the foundations of science, Geiger's counter has also become one of the foundations of popular culture, and this is reflected in the 1950s film "The Coronado Bell", with the cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans - such seemingly unlike scientists - in the lead roles:
Man: "What kind of thing is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms generated by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "That's right, I can hear it now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, not even a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Abnormal Cells
A New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to “See” Abnormally Growing Cells and Kill Them
Part of the vaccine’s therapeutic effect is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory.
As a result of this change, cells get the ability to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many types of cancer, then the cells must be reintroduced.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one patient who received the vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize abnormal cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory, after which the altered cells can “see” the HER2 protein characteristic of many cancers, then the altered cells are re-injected into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research at Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results we’ve obtained suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofsky explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
A similar method has been successfully applied in the treatment of leukemia. It consisted of capturing immune cells in patients and “teaching” them how to affect cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in a MAGA cap after his appearance in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday concert in which he spoke in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, claiming he would take the post again in 2020.
After performing his third song, titled “Ghost City,” in which he wore the cap “Make America Great Again,” the performer spoke out against the Democrats and supported Trump.
“Very often I talk to white people and they ask me, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL made a parody show starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christina Blasey Ford's sexual harassment allegations.
Television did not show how the crowd was outraged by West's statement, but this video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear if Rock tried to make fun of West with this move.
In addition, West complained to the public that behind the scenes ridiculed his cap.
“They messed with me behind the scenes.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They were really messing with me!
The Washington Examiner quoted him as saying, “They also said my position wasn’t cool.”
West goes on to say, "Do you want to know what's not cool? Put on a Superman cloak so that no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to evolve?
Then you need love.”
His comments at least twice caught the attention of the audience, the cast members of SNL seemed confused, and one person told the publication: "The whole studio has plunged into silence."
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love It" in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING MANY."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful."
“However, I don’t want to support anyone (by buying their music, their clothes, or otherwise supporting their work) who, in my opinion, shares and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and as another example, of course, we can cite the artist who recently became a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to the name of the artist formerly known as "Prince".
Attempted murder charge for stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died from knife wounds at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhacamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of Justice on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the brutal medieval HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor recently hotly criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such characters often inspire young people with the idea that in order to be respected, you need to be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believes “something went wrong” and wondered how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, Rose Leslie, his age, admitted that he is “very concerned” about the problem.
"Personally, I take this question quite seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of masculinity?" the actor asks.
“What are we teaching young people that we have such a problem today?”
Keith believes television may be partly to blame for this spike in toxic masculinity due to the overly muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is congenital and what is acquired?
What is it that is taught on television and in the streets that makes young men feel that they should show only one particular side of masculinity?
I think that’s really one of the biggest challenges of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because there's really something wrong with young people today.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any of the prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, saying that he "was done with the battles and the horses."
From November, Keith will star in the re-release of True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of the film’s producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best Game of Thrones finale for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Squirrel, the subject of the character's passion, Keith Jon Snow, in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple celebrated their wedding in June 2018 at the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country suffer from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, which indicates a change in the trends of the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of HIV infections in this way was practically reduced to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 per year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Studies confirm that due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaked information about Republican senators, complaining of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. MP Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that one of her employees posted personal information of three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
A Los Angeles Democrat claims the lawsuits were forged by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more sneaky lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators. Lindsey Graham, Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing in the Senate commission on sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office, and disclosed information about Waters employees.
“This unsubstantiated assertion is absolutely false,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent activities, was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unsubstantiated assertion is a complete lie.”
Waters’ statement prompted immediate online criticism, including from former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for working in Congress.
When you're accused of something you haven't done, why be angry?
There is no need to justify either.
It is also not necessary to dig into the motives of the prosecutors.
You have to stay calm and cool.”
Fleischer appeared to have compared Waters' reaction to Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee running for Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
“If it’s true, it’s important,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters wrote that her office had warned “relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent activities.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are found, and that they bear legal responsibility for all their actions, which can be destructive and dangerous for everyone and every one of my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again – A Weak Parody of Spy Rowan Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which the UK appears in one way or another; this also applies to the new parody spy franchise "Agent Johnny English", the production of which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film "Agent Johnny English: Reboot".
Will the self-ironic picture of “obviously we’re all shit” become a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, the bumpy-eyed profane Johnny English with a rubber face got his right to chaos for the second time - his name most vividly hints at the fact that he is a wide-screen comic creation intended for a non-English cinematic audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a glamorous smoothie, got a little clouseau, Mr. Bean’s features, and a portion of this guy who made a single note to the Chariots of Fire tune in London at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the personality of the traveler and the mysterious "international" Atkinson, who once played in the now forgotten television commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves behind a complete chaos.
There are one or two pleasant moments in this latest issue of JE.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the blades crawled on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates Atkinson’s gift for physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and oddly superfluous, especially because such “serious” film trials as “Agent 007” and “Mission Impossible” now confidently offer comedy as an element.
It feels like humor is meant for children, not adults, and to me Johnny English’s bizarre misfortunes are not as inventive and appropriate as Atkinson’s jokes in Mr. Bean movies.
The constant message now is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the top-secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the duty agent - Kevin Eldon, unfortunately, got an episodic role here.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and assertive figure already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for the quasi-Theresa May character, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to pull someone out of retirement.
And then the clumsy Johnny English himself comes on the scene, who now works as a school teacher in some Pontoon institution, but also gives unofficial lessons of secret operational work: there are some good jokes here, as English offers the skills of a spy academy in the style of "rock".
English returns to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunites with his former unlucky buddy Buff, who is played by Ben Miller this time as well.
Buff is now a married man, subordinate to the submarine commander - the role of the "fun hockey sticks", in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game because of terrible mistakes in Her Majesty's secret service. They encounter the beautiful fateful woman Ophelia Bulletova performed by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems - the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their odyssey of farce jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on Volta's luxury yacht; English breeds complete anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of the house.
All these scenes, of course, are cute and fanciful fiction, but in all this there is something quite childish.
Quite moderate things.
And as with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that is truly commensurate with his talent?
Labour denies that they are working on a plan to reduce the British working week to four days for a five-day salary.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but be paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants company executives to give workers savings from the AI revolution by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
Sources said the idea “fits” into the party’s economic agenda and will help the country’s population to take the side of the workers.
The trade union congress approved the move to a four-day working week so workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is our goal, which is consistent with the Party’s approach to changing the balances in the economy in favor of the workers, as well as the Party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week back during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to concretize his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to snatch power from “faceless directors” and “speculators” of utility firms.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current water-channel shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour government can make “deductions” based on alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on the boards of directors of companies and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the capital of private sector firms to workers who will be able to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment as supreme judge for at least a week and raises questions about whether the agency’s findings could encourage any Republican senators to back Kavanaugh.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham to see if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy replied.
“When I went to the hearing, I said that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, this information came out, I asked, “Did you do it?”
His answer was firm, definite and unambiguous.”
But Graham's opinion on the vote remained unshakable.
“I’ve made a firm decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, in the strength of action comparable only to dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but one thing I know for sure: Brett strongly denied all of this,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of those she called as witnesses could confirm these facts either.
This story has been going on for 36 years.
I didn’t see anything new in it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive stellar cast with an equally impressive mission – ending poverty around the world.
For the seventh year as part of the Festival of World Citizens, tens of thousands of people flock to the large lawn of Central Park, but not only to enjoy performances by performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to talk about the real goal of the event: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Festival of World Citizens, which opened in 2012, is a continuation of the global project to combat poverty, which is being carried out by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to volunteer or email a world leader, make a phone call, or perform any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Festival of World Citizens become in 12 years in terms of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free attendance to a concert really convincing fellow citizens to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” where people believe they are making real changes by signing an online petition or tweeting?
The organizers of Global Citizen say that since 2011, the festival has registered more than 19 million “actions” held by its supporters, which pursue many different goals.
It is mentioned that through these actions, world leaders have pledged to provide funds worth more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group voiced 390 commitments and announcements that were made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the funds provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most significant commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementation professionals committed to “helping children reach their full potential” pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the district. This was done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens members.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice against malnutrition a thing of the past,” said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken urging the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children through activities designed to improve nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival’s website: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The organizers of Global Citizen respond: “It will be a long and difficult road on which we will trip and fall from time to time.
But as in the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monet – these are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, and its hosts will be Deborra-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. May Use Navy to Block Russian Energy Exports: Interior Minister
U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said Washington could “if necessary” resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia’s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy in the same way they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the ability to ensure the openness of sea routes and, if necessary, the blockade so that their energy does not enter the market,” the minister said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He then compares Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually the same.
“Iran and Russia’s economic strategy is to use and replace fuel more or less efficiently,” he said, calling Russia a “one-trick pony” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The allegations come as the Trump administration has set a goal to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, which should double the pipeline’s existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce resistance to this project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I would like to underline that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists, represented by the Federation of German Industry (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third state interferes with our energy supplies, it creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will carefully study the possibilities of running for president in 2020
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would carefully study the possibility of running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting of the city council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the election race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and we need a woman upstairs to fix it,” Warren said.
“After November 6, I will carefully consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren praised President Donald Trump’s actions during the meeting as “leading this district in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an outspoken critic of both Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course we need to conduct an FBI investigation before proceeding with the vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most voters of Warren herself do not think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the contrary, support its plans.
The poll showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 percent supported his possible participation in the elections, and 48 percent opposed it.
Other well-known names of Democrats that have been discussed in connection with the 2020 outlook include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke about post-traumatic stress disorder Trak Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump voters
Trek Palin, 26, enlisted in the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is going through the same thing as other families who have suffered PTSD and have been injured, and our soldiers are coming back with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “a blemish on the eye” and said of her son and other war veterans, “they are returning already different, hardened, wondering if their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military respect they have shown to their country.”
Trak Palin was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a situation of violence and possession of a weapon in a state of intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vasilla’s police department.
18 States, D.C., Support Challenge to New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prohibits asylum for victims of fleeing or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district filed on Friday in Washington, D.C., an analytical note from a court adviser on the support of an asylum seeker challenging the policy.
The plaintiff’s full name in the “Grace v. Sessions” lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons, who are part of a criminal group,” subjected her to ill-treatment, but on July 20 U.S. officials rejected her asylum application.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace say El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are filing large numbers of asylum applications in the U.S. as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision made by the Immigrant Appeals Board in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of application of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the court’s counsel said in a statement.
Lawyers also argue that policies that ban immigrants from entering the U.S. are damaging the U.S. economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens who are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide shelter to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“Asylum will be granted to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in a June 11 statement.
This tool was never intended to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palu: death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly difficult.
“It’s very difficult right now,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her sick baby at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance brings the wounded.
Clean water is in short supply.”
Residents return to their ruined homes, dig into wet things and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dvi Harris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting near the army's Palu hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors because they were forced to leave the premises due to ongoing severe tremors.
He weeps as he recalls how a powerful earthquake destroyed a hotel room on the fifth floor he was renting with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was squeezed into the debris of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family came to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they’re safe and they’re okay now.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Attacks’ Through ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a four-page advertisement in a daily American newspaper outlining the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited a paid supplement to the Des Moines Register China Daily, Iowa's largest commercial newspaper, making accusations against China in an attempt to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6. This accusation China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election is a confirmation of a fact that U.S. officials told Reuters: a new stage in Washington’s growing campaign of pressure on China is coming.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalating trade war, as a result of which they level the tariffs on imports of their countries.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter to China, claims Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “now doubles this harassment by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of our dear American tradition of free speech and free press by paying for and advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“However, in the newsstands here on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices and see the true diversity of opinions that the Chinese could get acquainted with after learning about China’s worrisome economic policy, because the local media are under the strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of China’s most famous newspapers “skillfully discarded” the offer to publish his article, although he did not give the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: the spread of Kavanaugh Republicans repel women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many senior Republicans prefer to stand aside and defend the candidacy of Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual violence. Analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, which could affect the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotion surrounding the situation has heated to an extreme, and most Republicans have officially said they want to continue voting.
Such things cannot be returned to later,” writes Grant Rier, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s attempts to conduct an FBI investigation, made at the last minute, will be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November Ahead!” opposite the Senate when Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond that,” said nonpartisan political scientist Stu Rotenberg.
“People say that the situation has already gotten hot enough, and that’s true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of suburban female voters and young voters, ages 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the nominee for supreme judge, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed the nomination, the move could spark retaliation.
“It’s already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh sat on the dock, but it’s about how Republicans handle it, how they treat it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, a news channel.
Nevertheless, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on the question of who to believe – Ford or Kavanaugh, and a little more inclined to the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents accurately or most likely believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they accurately or most likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh most likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, while intoxicated, attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for supreme judge showed her his genitals at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee Solid open platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to give access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to gain “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he says of his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, as well as a calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools for working with data.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify - everything can be used in the same browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online data warehouse is that it is fully managed by the user, who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal empowerment through data.”
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company has provided the resources, processes, and relevant skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several full-time developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether his company should make drastic changes that will change all their business models completely overnight.
“We don’t ask them for permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee’s voice has sounded quite influential in the debate about net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: a clergyman awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this award on September 29, 1918, for his participation in the attack on Bellenglise and Loucourt.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
A monument to the event was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “very symbolic” that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette of September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vanne led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin “in very thick fog and under heavy fire of field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and with the "greatest courage" led the group forward, and then with one hand threw the field gun, knocking down three soldiers of the unit.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old's grandson, Michael Vann, said he "would hardly be able to do the same heroically, but it's humbling."
He and his brother Dr. James Wann also laid the wreath at the end of the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said it was "a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they were shown a Peppa Pig
Imagine that you didn’t sleep all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you weren’t allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 fights, including six mainstream fights, and the fights were broadcast all night long on Channel 5 UK television.
At 6 a.m., as Geghard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, fans in the UK were stunned to see Peppa Pig on the screens.
Some fans were not impressed at all, because they did not sleep until the morning just to watch the fights.
One fan on Twitter called the change to a children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke."
“There was a state decree that this content was inappropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, Peppa Pig.
Bellator president Scott Cocker said they plan to schedule the fights in a way that will allow viewers from the UK to watch in the future.
“As for the re-show, I think we can solve this issue,” says Cocker.
“But it’s Sunday, six o’clock in the morning, and we won’t be able to resolve this issue until Sunday in our time, and for them it’s already Monday.
But we'll do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a bunch of text messages were scattered, and all of them were far from friendly in nature.
We tried to solve this problem immediately, we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out that no, it was a matter of national importance.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for the fans we try to increase that number, but it was too much.
Yeah, it didn't go well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels Inferior About His Sexual Orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling the worst because of his sexuality, but that’s what gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4’s first Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that winning the Olympics began to worry him less after he had a baby.
The regular host of the long-term show Kirsty Young due to illness took a leave of absence for several months.
Daly, who played the lead guest on Laverne's show, said he felt "more insignificant than any of his peers" because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He relates: “Until now, these feelings of worthlessness and inappropriateness have been quite real, but they gave me strength and I was able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a well-known LGBT activist and, at his performance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to be able to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “caught him by surprise.”
Last year, Daley married an Oscar-winning actor who is 20 years older than him, but argues that the age difference has never been a problem.
“If so much is happening in your life at such a young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find a peer who would have had the same radically opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, having a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that "all his worldview" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it would be all about ‘I need to win a gold medal’,” he said.
“But you know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not want to put up with the fact that he was dying, and one of his last requests was for first-row tickets to the London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be there, and you can’t sit in the front row,’” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he actually stopped breathing that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” says the athlete.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew it was something I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song, Proud by Heather Small, which helped him prepare for the Olympics and he still likes it so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson, out of shape, spent this Saturday Ryder Cup on the bench
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to tighten up to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the Biennale for a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furik on Saturday for four goals and four sets.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time big winner split his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the pitch in the hope of fixing what was bothering him.
Never having had the most direct hit, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete is not an ideal candidate for the hard track of Le Golf National, where a long raft usually punishes for inaccurate hits.
And if the course itself isn’t frightening enough, Mickelson will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday’s ninth match, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who lost four points in 12 singles matches, make a bright start, Mickelson's match may be decisive.
Ferik expressed confidence in his partner, though, what else he could have said.
“He fully understood the role he was given today, slapped me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Ferik said.
“He’s pretty confident in himself.
He’s a walking Hall of Fame, and he’s done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two games.
I had hoped for more, but that was the way it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Foldo's record for the most games in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Ferik said his presence has brought considerable benefit to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s witty, he likes to cheer people up, and he’s a great guy to be interesting with,” he explained.
“I think the young players had fun with him this week and it was interesting to see.
His game is so much more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Björn knows that the big advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Björn, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that a significant singles lead in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a disadvantage.
The Danish made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but overcame the finish line only slightly ahead with the smallest difference, winning with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,” said Björn, captured in the photo, after watching the 2018 Class, winning on the field of Le Golf National yesterday with a score of 10 da-6, and a score of 5-3 on Friday.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you'll be in full swing.
Go and do the right thing.
As long as there are no glasses on the screen, it’s not over.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
“I have not spoken silently, focusing on our team’s 12 players, but we already know very well what we are up against – against the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with the way his players performed on an inconvenient golf course, Björn added: “I would never outdo myself in this.
Tomorrow we have a different test.
Tomorrow is the start of the show, and that’s a different story.
It’s always nice to be around a partner when things are going well, but when you’re there alone, you’re testing all your strengths as a professional golfer.
This is the idea that players need to instill in themselves to be fully exposed tomorrow.
Now the partner is left behind and he, too, has to do his best.”
Unlike Björn, his rival, Jim Ferik, believes that individually his players will perform better than with partners, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Ferik himself went through this whole carousel in recent days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn, before finally losing when Europe performed the Miracle at Medina.
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, rallied his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to finish it as quickly as in Brooklyn, as in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have built our game plan accordingly and set the guys up the way we thought was right, you know? Tomorrow we will try to do a miracle."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory McIlroy in the top match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Palter, as well as other European players from the top of the standings.
“I chose this group of guys, and in that order, because I believe that in this way they will cover all possible shortcomings,” said Björn, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The commissioning of the new German warship has been postponed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but that won’t happen even less next year due to faulty systems and avalanche-like cost increases, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, reports the newspaper Die Zeit with reference to the military representative.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they will have a powerful cannon, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant postponement of commissioning means that state-of-the-art warships, which are said to allow Germany to expand its power abroad, will already be obsolete by the time they come into service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless in combat.
The software shortcomings were particularly critical, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the workforce on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to implement upgrades in the future.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of anchoring the newest frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings about the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, admitted that the navy was in fact “out of stock of ships capable of deployment.”
The official said the problem worsened over time because the old ships were decommissioned, but no replacement ships were provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could ever be taken into service by the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret lives of bats
A new study, conducted in one of the Scottish Highlands estates, aims to show how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that the findings will give a new look at the behaviour of unique winged mammals and will help in further conservation efforts.
The study, organized by scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland, will study common bats, soprano bats, as well as brown long-haired bats and Dobanton nightshades inhabiting Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some points around the site to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile field surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of screams, as well as the activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the habitat will then be compiled and a report prepared to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Conservation Adviser, hopes these findings will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the main directions of habitat management, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways to maintain forests in a state optimal for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened with extinction due to construction and development works that affect their habitat and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can be dangerous, as can fly adhesive tape, chemical treatment of building materials and hunting domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to accurately identify obstacles on the flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bat populations very seriously.
The organization employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, on-the-spot checks, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even created Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of Scottish bats live.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the perfect area for them.
“Here at Threave, it’s a great place for bats,” he says.
“There are old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But much about bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need for a prosperous existence.”
He recalls the importance of checking for bats before conducting maintenance within private holdings, since the unintentional destruction of one nest can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young individuals, and perhaps even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by law, their destruction, harassment or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer at the Bat Conservation Foundation, is calling on the public for help.
She says, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many of their individual species live.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the rape allegations against him, calling them “fake news” and claiming that people just “want to get drunk” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published charges against the footballer.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga, who allegedly took place in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a video on Instagram, in which the footballer has 142 million followers, hours after the announcement of the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the information “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner claims on camera.
“They just want to sneak up on me using my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that’s just part of their job.
I’m a happy person and I’m doing great,” adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for charges they called “inadmissible information on confidentiality suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player intends to seek compensation for “moral damage in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy, but one percent bad.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but this was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to experience the traumatic feelings inflicted as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he switched to Italian giants Juve in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret carmakers lost forever'
Business and Entrepreneurship Minister Greg Clark said the UK would “regret it forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He also commented on information that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could result in the loss of jobs.
The Bernaston plant produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s managing director at Bernaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini production plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns stem from the fact that, according to automakers, in the absence of a deal within the framework of Brexit, the supply chain will be put at great risk.
Toyota’s production line is launched “just in time” and parts for custom-made cars are delivered by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruptions at the border, which industry officials said could lead to delays and lack of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store stock at its plant in Derbyshire for more than a day, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May’s plan, voiced in Checkers, for future relations with the EU “is precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We need a deal. We want to conclude a better agreement that will allow, I repeat, not only to achieve success now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future," he said on BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers argue that we should absolutely be able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not specify for how long it would stop production, but in the longer term warned that the additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the factory’s union, says the members’ concern is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we can’t get them back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to the White House
A responsible meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed to another week” as the fight for the candidacy of Brett Kavanaugh for the post of chief justice continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, the ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the president’s potential obstacles to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has been a big conjecture in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed using a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
On Monday, however, he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he “would not prefer” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee, at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into FBI complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, and it is possible that it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other events taking place in the Supreme Court.”
But let’s see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the lack of briefings is not caused by the "disdain for the community" of television reporters, although she added: "I will not deny that they are playing for the public."
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The president holds more meetings answering questions from journalists than any other president before him,” she added, without giving exact figures, “We have these numbers.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the ability to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.”
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we’ve had in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, that’s a worthy replacement for press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House, participating in open meetings or press conferences with senior officials.
Conferences exclusively for the press are a rarity.
The president’s frivolous, and sometimes bizarre, behavior in front of this week’s assembled journalists in New York may be the answer to why.
Health Minister addresses EU workers in Scotland with letter about Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health appealed to EU staff working in the Scottish Public Health Service to express gratitude from the estate of the whole country and wish them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, an MSP, addressed this letter to employees less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of filing status applications for EU citizens working in their public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of withdrawal continued, and this fall the expected decision should be made.
However, the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very troubling time for all of you.
Therefore, right now, I want to emphasize once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the performance of health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery for head injury
Michael Organ, from Tennessee, said midfielder Christian Abercrombie of the Tennessee States Tigers underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday after defeating 31-27 in a match against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reid told reporters the injury had been sustained shortly before the break.
“He went out to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting it on a stretcher and taking it to a medical examination.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/degree of injury" and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who had just entered the second year, it was his first season with Tennessee State after moving out of Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five goals, a total of 18 goals per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK.
Under Tory’s new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless.
This move will negate the results of Corbyn's attempts to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in favor of the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will undermine Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters, who promises to make housing more affordable and boost citizens’ incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, and the additional funds thus generated should stimulate the government’s efforts to help homeless citizens.
The surcharge on the existing stamp duty, including the increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary housing and rental housing, could be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects the move to generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s new properties are bought by non-British residents, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for buyers buying their first homes to improve their housing conditions afterwards.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who, having bought housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of bullying real estate prices by acquiring land but not actually using it, and urged Ms May to abandon affordable housing quotas to correct the “shameful housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include monitoring rents and ending unjustified evictions.
He also wants to give local governments more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year, I said that I dedicated my premiership to fulfilling the British dream – to make life better with each new generation.
And this, among other things, means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that for non-UK citizens, as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is just as affordable as for hardworking British people.
For too many people, the dream of acquiring their own home has become too far away, and the threat to be on the street for some is too real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to rule Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the revival of the Northeast club, which currently ranks third in the first league, separating from the championship by three points.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, that’s all,” Ross told the BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland with my father in Hampden as a child, and that always drew me back.
However, such an opportunity will only come if I can become a successful manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland managers were also Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel afraid of such authoritative names in such large clubs, previously refusing offers Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will depend on whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
In its structure and capabilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," the coach says.
Bringing him there is not an easy task, but I will consider that I have done my task only if I can bring the club back.
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, first as an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third level and the following season brought St Mirren from the lower positions to the championship winners.
Ross says he feels more comfortable today than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I truly believed that management was more suited to me than the game.
It sounds strange because I did everything well, made good money in this position and achieved some success.
But the game is more difficult.
There are a lot of things that need to be done weekly.
I still feel stressed at work, but I feel good in the managerial position.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now doing so makes me feel most comfortable as a fish in the water throughout my adult life.”

Summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but reduced sales in restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, and in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of CGA, the business consulting company that obtained the statistics, says: “Prolonged solar activity, as well as longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup, means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8%, and in restaurants, on the contrary, decreased significantly.”
The June decline in restaurant revenues by 1.8% continued in July as well.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol showed much higher results compared to restaurants.
Pubs selling only food have also suffered from the heat of the sun, though not as much as restaurants.
There is a feeling that people want to jump out on the street just to miss a glass.
Sales of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month, and food by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the non-domestic market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant chains continue to experience difficulties, especially since a drop in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be especially painful due to ongoing price pressures.
A long, hot summer has never been better for food operators, and it’s not the fact that August, bringing milder temperatures, will give a much-needed break.”
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, rose 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand shrinkage.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 chains with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a recognised industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of pages of “fake insta”
This news has heightened concerns about sexual content
Twenty Percent of Students Say They Have a ‘Basic’ Account That Parents Know About
However, one in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake insta accounts, i.e. Instagram, a photo-sharing site.
This news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic, “clean” account that their parents had access to, but they also had secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally accessed the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, stumbled upon a teenager who urged others to rape him.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two social media profiles, with half of them admitting that one of them is generally classified.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “Many teenagers are eager to create online spaces that are inaccessible to their parents and teachers, and that’s a worrying fact.”
Aileen Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” of Scottish athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Aileen Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a supervisory member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most titled athlete in athletics. Chairman Ian Beatty says the move is a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport to benefit from the athlete’s extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Aylid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community, and we are confident that her participation will bring great benefits to athletics in Scotland,” said Beatty.
Doyle says, “I’m looking forward to being the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, has a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now works as a regular commentator for the BBC, after suffering a stroke he has lost the ability to walk.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I lost the ability to move.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover, and if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again and today I do dexterity exercises!
Thank you very much for your support!”
The advertising of the milk pump, in which nursing mothers compared with cows, shared the opinions of Internet users
A milk suction company has sparked controversy on the internet by publishing an advertisement there comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
Launching what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an advertising music video demonstrating the freedom the new breast pump provides to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in a haystack to a music track that says, "Yes, I feed my own milk, but you won't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not udder, it's my breast."
And then the choir: "We pump, pump, we feed our babies with breast milk, pump, pump."
This ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them within a few days of being born.”
Elvie milk sucker dresses directly under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
But here is another comment: “It is clear that this is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milk suction for mothers who keep their babies?”
Another user adds: “Advertising detached from reality.”
Others, on the contrary, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was “just great.”
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was feeding a baby, I would definitely buy one.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a bit crazy, but it feels like this.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
And another comment: “Funny advertising designed for moms who are breastfeeding (often they do it right at their workplaces or in the toilets) and who, indeed, feel a little bit like “cows.”
This ad is not to praise or scold our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they were all dancing with these inconspicuous milk suckers hidden under their bras.
The concept behind this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breastfeeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, the Elvie milk suction is completely imperceptible, has no wires or tubes, freely fits into the bra for feeding, and at the same time is imperceptible, giving women the opportunity to move, hold babies and even go outside while feeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and early childhood development specialist at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s milk pump is so revolutionary that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
Drawing a parallel between women and milking cows, we wanted to bring to the spotlight breastfeeding and all its problems, while demonstrating in a humorous and hilarious way the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk suction gives.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s milk suction has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Martha Jakubovska, using this product for its intended purpose.
Hundreds of migrant children seamlessly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies made it difficult to place children with guarantors.
Typically, most of the sponsors themselves are the same undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by taking a child underwritten.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guarantors and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints, and that this data would be handed over to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to take on the bail of underprivileged minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“About 80 percent of persons who are either guarantors or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a significant part of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these individuals,” Albens said.
In an effort to expedite the process of registration of children, officials have introduced new rules, according to which some of them must appear before the court within a month after detention, and not after 60 days, as was previously the case.
In order to declare their legal status to an immigration judge, many of them are present by video call rather than in person.
Those deemed not eligible for assistance would be expeditiously deported.
According to shelter workers and information that has appeared in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers say these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw troops immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Muallem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They must leave immediately and without any conditions,” he told the gathering.
Muallem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been driven from their homes, “the war on terror is almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Muallem said good conditions had been created for their return, and blamed “some Western countries” for “spreading irrational fears” that prompted refugees to stay outside the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be helped to rebuild until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major stronghold of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity for continued political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had “clear timelines” and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants from the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, who would be “destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, will be convened soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the commission’s work should be limited to “considering the articles of the current constitution,” and cautioned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal do not prematurely end his presidency, which is what many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
And it will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential finale in history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed cable ratings, gathering 3.5 million viewers on screens in the evenings of the main news.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s beyond our comprehension,” says Neil Baer, director of ABC’s drama The Appointed Survivor, about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, a long-published comedy writer and author of “Only Funny: A Few Unpleasant Truths About Penetrating the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” offers a different theory.
She recalls how she once drove a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, “Because it’s funny!”, says Mrs. Scowell.
In all this chaos, there is something valuable - it's fun.
Of course, because unlike all other content broadcast on television, the storylines of the events of Washington can determine the future of “Roe vs. Wade” and answer questions about the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, for the sixth hour in a row, watch a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of the “deep background” for his book Fear, or Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket (clothes warmed by pride), or a sharp description of Stormy Dee.
I’ll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“Part of his job is to make us feel like a reality show is feeding you something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars about Trump’s changing cast and daily plot twists.
You can’t afford to miss a single episode, or you’re hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 27 degrees warm on the north shore of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC during the CNN recording.
He couldn’t get away from the screen, at least not exactly when they show Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and deciding the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss says.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Outsider money poured into the harshest midterm elections that the White House is leading
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district receives cash flow from changing districts in Congress, where two officials compete for the same seat.
This suburban area of Pittsburgh, the geography of which was recently changed, supports the Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in a snap election last spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent official, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which substantially intersects with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that election fraud had resulted in old districts being attributed to Republicans in violation of the constitution.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated debate over campaign funding between the main party's financial forces, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after winning with a small margin in the widely observed March special congressional elections in Pennsylvania's 18th district.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district, gaining 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give Democrats a small advantage.
The US punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, which caused a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. His property was also in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was only considered for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, economic development and support.
Proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would be painful for this Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
Against the backdrop of regular internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America were postponing a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to take stock of a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the preparations for the conference to move forward, and had effectively stopped considering the question of punishing El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October, and Vice President Mike Pence will speak in a sign that the administration attaches great importance to this meeting.
Three U.S. diplomatic envoys returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, carrying no new tough messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman, Mr Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were shared by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by a third-party analyst, who is a member of the administration, but also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be a report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, as there is currently very substantial evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia and its attack during the last election.
If Congress changes host, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he is preparing to speak again to voters, and possibly eventually to a jury of his peers.
But there are many “ifs”; I don’t mean that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, as are his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d’état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
We did not, however, and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history unfolds precisely at such points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are going through some of these turning points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, last year he offered to make secret records about the president’s activities and argued about his unfitness for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that The Times data is incorrect.
“How are we going to react if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or truthful, or if he is approved for the post of supreme judge despite credible sexual harassment allegations and false testimony?
Above all, will we vote for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable in the medium term?
If we do not pass these tests with dignity, then this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to pass them with dignity thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied the embassy where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she accompanied me to light the Saturday candles on the swastika symbol table.
With such a family past, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic in the run-up to a clash with the Viennese Rapid football club.
The Rangers host Viennese Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will allow them to take a strong position in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing for the first time in a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
“It was a good moment for us because Villarreal are a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game thinking we could get something and left with a draw.
Maybe we could have handled it in the end, but overall, the draw was probably a fair outcome.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success came in the second half, where we performed better.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a tough one, considering everything that has to do with my injuries and the replacements at the club, but there’s a good factor in this place right now.
The composition is perfectly matched, and the guys really enjoy it; the training went on "hooray".
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women lose sleep because of fears about their retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want to be cared for by someone in the family, but they don’t try to discuss it with them,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
And we have to start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family for the fact that they will probably have to take care of you if you don’t voice your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you will get medical care, as this choice can be an important factor in terms of costs.
Consult your financial advisor: he will help you develop a plan to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed money life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or insure yourself with your own property provided you have the money.
Bring your legal documents in order: save yourself from legal battles.
Draw up a power of attorney for medical care and appoint a trustee who will oversee your medical care and make sure that specialists fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
It is also recommended to consider the possibility of creating a financial power of attorney.
You should choose a trustee who will help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your bills in case you find yourself incapacitated.
Do not forget about the little things: imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical care and he is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to provide information about what medications he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on paper so that you are properly prepared in case.
Martin adds: “It’s not just the availability of finances that matters, but the choice of doctors.”
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of your dog?
Write it down and write it down.”
In Ilfracombe, a man fired several times from a pneumatic rifle
The man fired several shots from a pneumatic rifle, returning home from a party.
The victim, whose chest, abdomen and arm were hit by bullets, 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 GMT, as an "accident".
The victim did not see the attacker.
Injuries are not life-threatening and police are currently searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to communications failures, rescuers are unable to obtain any information from Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palu as a result of the natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (2017 figures).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary with the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a county stretching along 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, which is smaller than the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province's economy, but is mainly concentrated in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the tsunami has destroyed Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also occurred in the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Volcanic Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck Pidi Jaya District in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Indonesia Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily remained under the ruins.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence by intervening in a domestic violence situation and for resisting arrest, according to a report released by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took away her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in detention center Mat-Su and will be released on bail of $ 500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “unambiguous innocence.”
Palin faces three Class A minor offenses, which means he could be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable by up to one day ' s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forging a report of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon in a state of intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after explaining her son’s violent behavior as a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and the death toll will increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos of the incident on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecutor’s office wants to give a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York a rare death sentence
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight people and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to obtain the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges may be subject to a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read out Saipo’s 22-point indictment, which included eight racketeering charges commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and vehicle destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “carefully planned and deliberate”, Saipov carried out it, as described, “in a disgusting, cruel and criminal way”.
Saifullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Laure Decadta, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuk.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since a prosecutor demanded the death penalty for a criminal offense in the Southern District of New York.
In September 2009, the accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last federal death penalty in New York City was in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed using the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack.
Police said he told investigators he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching a video of ISIS on his phone.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on Saipov’s side, said they were “clearly disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only aggravate the pain of these events for all of their participants,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense had previously appealed to prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says NIDEL FARAJ Should Not Be Responsible for Brexit Negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel the ferocity” of Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party member Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have “already left” if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
However, the problem that Mrs May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is compounded by the fact that members of the Tory party who oppose leaving the EU join a separate protest against Brexit taking place in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his compromise plan, voiced in Checkers in the midst of attacks from Brexit supporters, his opponents and the EU.
Allies insist she should continue to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “beat the Checkers.”
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be leveled up and held accountable for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have left,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will continue to stand for Brexit, but we need to beat the Checkers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight world wars to be dependent.
We want to make our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.”
Brexit supporter Tory’s Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, making the following comment to reporters: “I say: Prime Minister, just listen to the people.”
“Checkers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also unpopular with our party members and our activists who are actually storming the streets and electing us first.
“Please put the Checkers aside and start listening to what you’re being told.”
She added: “Prime Ministers stay at their jobs if they stay true to their promises.”
Mr Farage said that if politicians are going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, it means they need to be made to “feel the heat”.
“It’s now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let this out of your hands.’”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of Brexit marched through Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved “Tory against Brexit” posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Labour Party member Lord Adonis criticized the Conservatives for security issues in their party’s mobile app.
“And these people claim that they can set up Canada plus plus IT systems and technologies, to work at borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is a farce.
“There is no good Brexit in principle,” he said.
Warren plans to “examine thoroughly” the possibilities of participation in the presidential race
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would “scrupulously study the possibilities of running for president.”
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat on Saturday spoke about his future at a meeting of the town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Jeff Deal, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There is talk that she has a chance to take the Trump post in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, she held another meeting with voters; since Trump took office, it was her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a town hall meeting.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that requires a woman at the top.”
As a result of the murder of Sims (stuck), the LSU player was arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder (shooting) of LSU basketball player Wade Sims, which occurred on Friday, was arrested.
At 11:00 a.m., at a press conference, Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department released a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who managed to be filmed.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot dead outside the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
“Wade Simms received a gunshot wound to the head that killed him,” Murphy’s chief of police, J. Paul, told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being involved in the incident, carrying a gun, and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist the arrest and was taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the title of world champion after team tactics gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday, overtaking Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that the team tactics of Mercedes will play a big role in the race.
Already with pole position Bottas started well and almost hung on Hamilton, when he defended his position on the first two corners, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go on a pit stop, leaving Hamilton in the tail of the whole group - a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes went on a pit stop one lap later, and then came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after some wheel-to-wheel struggle, broke out ahead, which led the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior free, risking to get caught after a double movement to defend in the third corner.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place towards the end of the first round.
Then he led most of the race, holding on to his native tires, with the aim of finishing quickly, pushing Kimi Räikkönen to fourth place.
As a result, he went on a pit stop on the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace on the remaining eight rounds, as Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day turned out to be a tough one as Valtteri did a fantastic job over the weekend and showed real nobility in sharing it with me.
The team has done such an exceptional job to have a couple of stunts in stock,” Hamilton said.
Traitor Sign Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Feinstein at a voters’ meeting on Saturday for her claim that she did not make public a letter from Christina Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, the supreme judge’s nominee, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying that what was happening in the Senate showed that those involved in the events were “sneaky, disgusting, and lying people.”
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what’s been going on in the last few days in the Senate, is fine, it’s anger, it’s anger, it’s disgust, it’s lies,” he said.
“You see all these leaks, and then they say, ‘No, I didn’t do it.
I didn’t do that.”
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you "speak" the information?
Do you remember her answer... did you “sharp” the information of the document?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't spill it.
All right, stop.
Did we “merge”? ... No, we did not “merge”, – he added with the intonation of the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the accusations made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally made public, but Feinstein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, but I didn’t leak her information,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the allegations of leakage did not seem to appeal to the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “Here’s what I’ll tell you: body language has failed her pretty well.
She may not have spilled, but body language was the worst I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend his nominee for supreme judge, whom three women have accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats are using those accusations for their own purposes.
“They are definitely trying to regain power by all the means available.
We see meanness, disgust, they don’t care who they offend, through whom they have to step in order to gain power and control,” Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
British Elite Hockey League: Dundee Stars 5–3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against Dundee
In the Elite Hockey League game, the Dundee Stars paid for Friday's defeat against the Belfast Giants, winning the rematch on Saturday with a score of 5-3 in favor of Dundee.
The Giants got an early advantage in two goals thanks to the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilliers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the home team before Dwyer led the Giants.
François Bouchard tied Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
For Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, it was the third loss of the Elite League season.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides when the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after a goal pass by Kendall McFall with the support of David Rutherford, after which Beauviller doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt assisted Coney in equalizing the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants intercepted the initiative in the first break when he scored the second goal in the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped, and Bouchard again leveled the score, scoring a goal with a numerical lead at 27:37.
Coney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the opportunity to take the lead for the first time in a match at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured victory by holding rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are headed to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
The air traffic controller was killed so that hundreds of people on board the plane could avoid the earthquake
Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously awarded the title of hero after he consciously went to his death in order for the plane with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many missing in a powerful earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday that caused a tsunami.
Strong tremors continue to destroy the area, many residents of the city of Palu were under the debris of buildings.
Despite the fact that his colleagues were fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the terribly swaying control tower of Mutiara airport Sis Al Jufri, Palu city.
He stayed in place to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
Then, when it seemed to him that the tower was collapsing, he jumped from it.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian news agency ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter could land in Palu.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll from the earthquake could reach thousands, as, according to the disaster management agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The death toll is likely rising as large numbers of people are still under the debris, and many have never been able to get out,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, which will host a mass burial of the dead on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: “Ambulances are bringing in victims every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross staff are already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
The tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and spoke to the country’s armed forces, in particular, saying: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports one person missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that operated the flight, which crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person is missing, while earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew safely left the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it does not have any information about one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to track down the man.
The airline was unable to immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue the other passengers and the crew of the plane after it fell to the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The causes of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses say the plane failed to land on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes says the plane is getting too low on the runway.
“And that’s very good,” adds Janes.
Janes said that he and other passengers managed to get to the emergency exits on a sinking plane, as the water level was to the waist.
He also said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming on board, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors repairing the nearby pier also helped with the rescue, using an inflatable boat on which they brought people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died in air crashes with PNG-registered airliners over the past two decades, but none of these accidents had anything to do with Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst managed to prove the fact of burning a woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution opened a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told members of the department how he used cell phone recordings to make a general picture of the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained data on the whereabouts of these people from several cell phones; according to this data, Tellis was spending time with Chambers that evening, which contradicts his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but his cell phone was reportedly in the vicinity of Chambers; when it became clear, the police questioned Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said that “it’s a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, according to the phone records, they only made calls for one week.
Roulette also revealed that some time after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale says.
The defense must begin presenting its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Aware Hip-Hop?
The hip hop trio is going to fight the negative attitude towards this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The Bristol-based band The High Breed claims that the content of hip hop has changed, moving away from the original political and social issues.
The band members want to go back to their roots and make “conscious” hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York Nanny Sues Couple for Racist Texting
A New York-based nanny sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from a woman complaining that the nanny turned out to be “another black” that the woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
The couple denies being racist, claiming the lawsuit was filed for “extortion purposes.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she learned that the new nanny offered by the childcare service, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family for her first day of work in 2016.
“NOT HER, ONLY NOT THIS, ONE MORE BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending a text message to her husband, she mistakenly sent it to Miss Morris twice.
Realizing her mistake, “confused” Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, saying in the service that the nanny, who turned out to be an African-American, was not doing her job well, and in general, that they were expecting a Filipina, not an African-American, according to the New York Post.
Morris was paid for one day of work and then sent home on Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple and demanding $350 a day for six months — under the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, were not enshrined in any contract.
“I want them to understand that these things are unacceptable,” she told The Post on Friday, adding, “And I know that this is discrimination.”
The couple disagreed with the allegation of racism, and argued that the dismissal of Maurice could be considered a reasonable step, as having offended her, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t really mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joe Plasco, the husband, told The Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone you were rude to, even if you were rude and didn’t want to?
Would you trust your newborn baby?
“Come on, you!”
Calling the lawsuit “extortion,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to a child just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“And you are ready to persecute a man who finds himself in such a situation?
Not very nice of you,” added a bank employee specializing in investing.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already issued its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behavior and problems with logic.
Publishers Paddington feared that readers would not understand the move with the talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the work for the first time, even before it’s published.
It’s funny to know that Paddington has been a huge success.”
She also said her father, before he decided to write a children's book about the bear, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, and would have dismissed the publication with optimism, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of his books was "both joyous and bitter" since last year their author disappeared.
As for Paddington himself, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family,” and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually gained fame.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” his daughter says.
"After all, Paddington was so real to him, and for a father it was almost as if his own child had achieved success: he was proud of him, although he did not really consider this success to be his own merit.
I think that’s how he treated Paddington’s success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear himself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After landing the plane, her daughter was taken to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad regularly called and said that everything was really bad, that something went wrong,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa.
“Then he called again and said she was going to die within the next two minutes and that we had to say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that the doctors gave her, making her heart work, gradually ceased to work, leaving her body.
She died sooner than expected.
I had to just sit and wait, knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself tight.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, accepting the enormous loss she had just had to endure.
“Nobody around here knew what happened,” she says.
“My head fell, I didn’t stop crying.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this overwhelming feeling of empathy for Nadia.
He needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her.”
Women who have survived the loss of loved ones prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking this step.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey place postcards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to experience what I experience every day,” she says.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a great cook and had a hell of a charming smile.
Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiles, it’s like a light in the room.”
However, before his death, he quit his job because he was going through really terrible times.
It happened in 2014, and the suicide of Tyler was found by his brother, who was then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, “I don’t stop worrying about a chain reaction.”
Mrs. Davis came up with these postcards, “so that people know there’s someone to turn to and tell everything, even if it’s your friend.
You can’t sit still, you have to talk to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, with whom she had lived for 15 years - he died shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he was feeling depressed or upset or anything like that,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas, he felt particularly bad: he didn’t even look at the children when they opened their gifts.”
She says his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through this, this event shocked our family.
It ripped her apart.
But we have to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance: the FBI begins an investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — an investigation limited in time and scope, we could bring at least a little unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “rising apart” amid a growing party chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their hesitation.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, things go badly for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want and elect him as the country’s supreme judge.
George W. Bush calls the senators to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who had once worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and who, thanks to Bush, had become acquainted with his future wife, Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to address the issue of vote equality and confirm his candidacy for the post of supreme judge.
North Korean Refugees Decrease Under Kim
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-seug, citing data from the South's ministry, said that compared to the 2,706 escapes recorded in 2011, the figure dropped to 1,127 last year.
Mr. Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher rates charged by smugglers exporting people.
Pyongyang does not make public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the reliably protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to resume deadlocked nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which they reached common agreements on disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yoon-ho accused the United States of hampering progress on the issue with its sanctions.
“If we don’t have the slightest confidence in the United States, we also won’t have confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no way be able to start disarmament unilaterally,” Mr. Ree said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, a supreme court nominee, “hysterical” and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave in this way, she would immediately be called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual harassment, which allegedly took place when they were both still teenagers.
Kavanaugh was quite emotional, sometimes even screaming and suffocating, talking about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and clearly planned assassination of an actor” orchestrated by liberals furious that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with his allegations and the way he’s attacking the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable if his guilt was confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Kavanaugh bypassed the question of whether he would overturn some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time to put a hysterical and biased person in the position of supreme judge and at the same time exclaim, ‘How magnificent!’” Pelosi said.
And women have to own it.
It's righteous anger, months and years of rage, she can't go through it without tears.
“When we’re angry, we cry,” Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s as unusual as you think?”
She continued: "I was very helped by a woman who worked somewhere in a management position. She told me that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique with which she explained to her interlocutor: "You may think that I cry because I am upset.
I’m actually angry.”
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed with this approach.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first work in an office dominated by men: I once cried with furious anger, but I was grabbed by the neck by an elderly woman, a soulless manager, whom I had always been terribly afraid of, and dragged to the staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re crying out of anger.
They think you’re upset, and they’re happy to think they’ve finally brought you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some frivolous affair and walked out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to run for president.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
The campaign was already coming to an end, it was far behind in fundraising, and so she swore not to participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It seemed like a totally losing option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 each to men, offered her only $250.
“What am I to them, a priced commodity, or what?” she wondered.
When she delivered her speech announcing that she would not run an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions — gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access voters, and anger over gender discrimination that she suffocated.
“You’d think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what are they going to write on my monument?
"She cried endlessly?"
How a Trade War with America Could Benefit Beijing
Experts believe the first salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, the split between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, when new tariffs affected $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in goods, effectively taxing half of all U.S. goods coming from China.
Beijing has struck back every time, recently imposing $60 billion in tariffs on U.S. goods ranging from five to ten percent.
China has promised that retaliatory measures against the United States will be equivalent every time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to start experiencing even the slightest difficulties in the near future.
To force Washington to back down means to yield to the demands, but to publicly yield to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war could provide long-term support for China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a premature political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to an economic spin-off in either of these countries is actually much more dangerous than previously acknowledged by observers,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow at the Center for New American Security, which specializes in Asia.
Syrian Foreign Minister Says ‘Ready’ to Return Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and safer thanks to the successes in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live there in peace.
All conditions are now in place for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country will not accept aid on any terms or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe consolidates victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost on European soil six times in a row, and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe regained its crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, made his first long shot into the water on the 16th hole of par-3, giving up his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming the 1st-4th player to ever go 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated 5:4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup last time.
Spaniard Sergio García, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the winner of the tournament in the history of Europe with 25.5 points for his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to win the cup again.
It’s all about the team, and I’m glad I was able to help,” says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a single game on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud of this victory – I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, behind only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend, in vain trying to succeed, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finow, who showed top-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we were able to beat Europe a little bit.
It didn't work.
We take off our hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played well.
We will regroup, I will work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward to achieve success.
I love all 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You have to know how to lose.
We have lost."
Red tide: news The concentration of microorganisms decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission’s latest report reflects an overall decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay Area.
According to FWC, in the areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties reported abundant flowering, which indicates a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Tide stretches approximately 130 miles of coastline from the northern Pinells to the southern Lee counties.
Foci can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but their number has decreased significantly compared to last week.
A red tide is also observed in Pascoe County.
Last week, average concentrations were reported in and near Pinellas County, low to high concentrations in Hillsborough County's coastal area, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasota County and coastal areas, average concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations on the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Cole County.
In Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, airway irritation is still likely.
In Northwest Florida, no such possibility was reported last week.
