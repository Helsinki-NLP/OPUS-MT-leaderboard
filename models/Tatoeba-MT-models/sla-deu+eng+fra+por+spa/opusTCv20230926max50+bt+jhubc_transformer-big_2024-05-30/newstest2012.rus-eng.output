Parliament does not support Tymoshenko’s freedom amendment
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in the course of amending the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected an attempt to repeal the article according to which the leader of the opposition, Yulia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would have resulted in the release of a former prime minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the bill on commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was deemed unprofitable.
The verdict is not final; the court will hear Tymoshenko’s appeal in December.
Tymoshenko claims that the verdict is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process is also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to ratify it.
Victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya already has losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert. Without him, the war is over.
It is time to determine the winners.
Islamists tend to win; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The transitional government has declared itself a follower of the customary Sharia law, of which we have already heard.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the punishment for theft is decapitation.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and would hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is neither unique nor the best and probably would not be suitable, for example, for the population of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from non-believers.
Their only justification is that they believe that the NATO raids were led not by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after each strike.
And if you look for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootings, we served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of profit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not have to worry about the expulsion of the "crusaders".
Although without occupation, will oil companies get Libya’s black gold at virtually no cost?
Most likely, they will not. And then the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of civil rights.
Unless the Shariahists put an end to it.
A New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are now in the spotlight of investors.
A statistical storm swept through Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries published GDP data in the 3rd quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stagnation, Germany and France are showing growth.
And yet the debt market today is breaking records.
Investors are already looking not only at Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%; France - by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was doing better than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of the initial 0.1%). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (the initial information assumed stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in a state of stagnation. According to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts had predicted.
Key Events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed growth compared to the previous quarter by 0.2%, which coincides with analysts’ forecasts.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The yield of its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The yields of both Italian and Spanish bonds are approaching a critical point.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the fact that the situation in the region is deteriorating, the yield of Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4%.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor that can save the situation.
The Czech national team was selected for the Euro.
In Montenegro, they won 1-0 and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team successfully coped with the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and the beautiful goal of Petr Jiracek, they won with a score of 1: 0.
In the second half, the Czech team was lucky enough to retain a significant advantage after the home rematch, and it will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and great luck in the second.
The Czech national team, in part because of the team's defeat at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Jira<0xC4><0x8D>ek; won 1–0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanovi<0xC4><0x87> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x87> became the most unsuccessful couple of the match after missing two great opportunities.
The magnificent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech is one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year. And Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minute the game was very intense.
Both teams had difficulty making combinations; most of the time the game was played in the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the home team in the first half. Long-range strikes beyond the defensive line were carefully intercepted by the Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred university students have created a human shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In this way, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible attack by Israel.
At noon on Tuesday, the prayers of students before the entrance of the building were followed by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a human shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They have thus demonstrated their willingness to defend their country’s nuclear program at the cost of their lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) pointed out that everything indicates that Iran has not abandoned its attempt to acquire nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran has been discussed in Israel.
At noon on Tuesday, the prayers of students before the entrance to the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant were followed by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at paralyzing Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, the targets would be, according to the Israeli press, installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is being carried out.
Nutrition of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% are obese.
According to the latest study, children suffering from obesity usually come from families that lead an unhealthy lifestyle.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and behavioral patterns accompanying a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from obesity, almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19% of obese children ate French fries for dinner on the eve of a survey related to an educational event called Obesity is no accident.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not play sports. This, however, applies to the majority of families of modern schoolchildren - only 15% of children said that their parents find time to play sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of the last academic year and involved nearly 900 elementary school students across Bohemia.
The Obesity event was held for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company Obesná zdravní poji<0xC5><0xA1>t'ovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 pupils from grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient athletic activity are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either overweight or obesity.
“For example, only half of the respondents said they eat five times a day, according to the breakfast-meal-meal-meal-meal-meal-meal-meal scheme, and this is one of the prerequisites for proper nutrition,” says one of the findings of the study.
No lunch or sausages in the evenings.
Experts warn that for healthy development, even such relative details as the constant time of the family breakfast are important.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families have breakfast together.
Most families eat breakfast separately.
The worst finding was that in every tenth family, people don’t eat breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of the correct daily diet.
The study found that fried foods are more commonly consumed in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sugary soft drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40% of children exercise regularly, this figure is more than halved – up to 15% – when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to make their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged 12-15 are far from ideal when it comes to healthy eating."
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
“The high popularity of sweetened beverages is of particular concern,” the study concludes.
As the main dinner dish, the pasta defeated the bird with a small margin.
However, the children showed little interest in legumes, fish and vegetable dishes.
Striving for a healthy lifestyle
The study also found that children are willing to change their eating habits provided they are provided with relevant information.
"Many participants in the control group of the study showed a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when filling out the questionnaire after the lecture Obesity is not an accident," the results of the project say.
This was especially noticeable, for example, in the case of sugary soft drinks - more children began to prefer them just water.
In addition, as a main dish, children were more likely to mark the poultry and fish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and pastries.
A stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article on training for stylists, I complained about the amount of information in the introductory classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in the field; tips on choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how it all works in real life.
Further - more.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really full of information.
This time with Alenka, the director, (there is not a single man in the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, the other has a boyish figure without proper shapes, another weighs more than normal.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce broad shoulders, lengthen the neck or add missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. the owners of more lush breasts and thighs and narrow waist, without wearing them too provocative.
For example, if the difference in the volume of the waist and hips is so great that you can not pick up a skirt or trousers, it is worth having at least one thing sewn to order.
You will clearly not regret the invested funds, since ideally sitting clothes are invaluable.
In a skirt made to order, you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves away, rolls down, strips the waist, etc.
Owners of boyish figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with ruffles, appliques, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of this kind of information and the types of figures, I’m glad I have a whole week to realize it all.
And yet, I'm afraid that's too much, given the homework we've been given.
Each participant of the course had to come up with two outfits for any celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I’m going to dress up Miranda Kerr, who you may know from Victoria’s Secret advertising campaigns.
I’m happy for myself because it’s a lot easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguilera, who recently gained a ton (please keep in mind that I’m exaggerating), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet, print and process them using graphics programs.
Mudboard – so called the result of the work – then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphical component of the style.
The stylist does not just dress real people, but creates grocery pages in magazines (based on special instructions, for example, fashion bags, coats, etc.).
This is what stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us.
But that was only on Sunday.
A stylist needs general knowledge
The Saturday lecture, full of information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests - specialists in this field.
Stylist, Honza Pokorny; fashion designer, Jakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Ranch.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist knows how to use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a trench coat can be worn the usual way, on top of jeans and t-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be worn on the naked body, without clasps, like a dress.
Another option is to roll up the sleeves or lift the collar, and the whole image changes completely.
“Play with him,” he said.
Anyway, I appreciated the following advice the most: "For your work, you need to know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them," Jacob told us.
Here I finally understood why we are studying all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see completely different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
I learned from Ben, a photographer, that a stylist should have more outfit options on hand than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a ten-page fashion review (equivalent to ten outfits) I must be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture the item of clothing often looks and works in combination with others in a completely different way than in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorny confirmed that often the image and style is half the success.
Just take a look at Madonna, who doesn’t have a striking vocal, but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
The attitude towards the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often find it superfluous (and believe that it is enough to be an expert in something, and the way they look - secondary).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we should expect them to name us a different (lesser) size than the one they actually wear.
Then we turn to Google and find out if the tabloids have written anything about some celebrity getting fat/skinny, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it is not enough for a stylist to understand fashion and be able to pick up a outfit.
Our work mainly consists of communicating with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to condone them and stick to their opinion.
“If a manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can’t throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are awful.”
“Find at least a few things you can praise and advise what you can wear with them,” says Mario.
He also showed us what exactly should fit a work bag.
This is a bag that you tie around your waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to the obvious things such as scissors, sticky roller or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylists use it when shooting some items, such as bags or hats), special clips to fasten the fabric on the back in case the clothes are too large (blows and similar items are prohibited for clothes) or set because they spoil the clothes)
In order to distract from the lectures and gain some practical experience, we learned how to properly make the linings on the soles of shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged – not to mention shooting outdoors.
And here we go with the glue.
You should not touch the shoes with scissors, so as not to spoil them.
It requires real skill.
I was pleased that Mario praised my work.
I did not like the skills mentioned.
This is only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I’m starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn’t that easy, no matter what you say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Revision
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning commute to work due to a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
The ambitions were satisfied to some extent, but that didn’t matter, because no one clearly wanted to do the extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subtitle "Escape" was associated with high hopes.
It was expected to move the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demo versions indicated that the game would take a worthy place in the genre of racing games.
We were curious to see the parts of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, it ends up being a lot different than we expected.
The game is quite a good arcade race, but the overall impression spoils several unnecessary mistakes that are present in this series of games for several years.
So, in fact, these are not errors, but a manifestation of the inexplicable laziness of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You become part of a story whose main character, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
This idea has some interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes place on its own route, individual stages are held in a diverse and interesting environment.
Therefore, there is no feeling that the same thing is happening all the time in the game.
Despite the fact that the graphics are at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some tracks are nice to look at.
And yet the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs or high in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the race from time to time brings to life an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert, you fall into a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to fall under the avalanche.
The races are pretty well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that’s enough.
For a while you are trying to overtake several opponents (essentially a normal race); then you are trying to improve time (a standard race with a stopwatch); or you are competing against one opponent.
Among other things, from time to time you run into the police, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components on the outside of the car are new.
This is just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
Although surprisingly, these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (only three to be exact).
In fact, it turns out that this is good for the game because this property is not boring; given all of the above, this is one of the things that make the game more entertaining.
The racing model follows in the footsteps of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a disadvantage.
If you’re looking for an imitation of real life, you’ll have to look elsewhere.
And yet, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic racing, although there are better options on the market.
So far, so good.
After a while, however, the problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don’t expect complicated transformations and collisions from such a game, but if you have no idea before a collision with an object how your car will behave, something is wrong.
Usually, overtaking or driving past cars in a dense stream, you sometimes slightly touch another car. And yet sometimes in almost a similar situation, your car begins to spin wildly.
Or smashed up.
It’s not that important thanks to the restart system, but it’s enough to ruin the fun.
The restarts are arranged so that if you crash or go far away from the track, the game takes you back to the point where it stopped.
However, there are only five reboots available for each race.
If you use them all, you will have to start the race from the beginning.
This is useful in case something doesn’t work out, but you can’t fully rely on it.
Sometimes reboots are not enough, and you have to memorize a separate section of the race.
An important drawback of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be done in a certain way, otherwise you just won’t fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a certain place in the same configuration regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your opponent easily drive between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you find yourself there, the cars are already arranged in such a way that you need to either bypass them or reduce speed.
It doesn’t matter when you’re next to them; everything is arranged so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have other advantages.
During the game, you discover several places where, no matter the time, the same opponent overtakes you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you drive in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand in front of you no matter what.
The fact is that when it rides in front of you, it worsens your visibility, leading to one or more accidents at that site.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it is so obvious that it quickly begins to cause irritation.
It’s a pity, because despite the simple driving model, the game is entertaining and sometimes so eventful that you don’t have time to pay attention to what’s happening around you.
It doesn’t matter what keeps you bored – a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races or something else.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
You need to keep track of the gas stations along the way, as it is on them that your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars for straight sections of the highway; and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain tracks.
The main mode of story mode is closely related to the mode of challenge mode; these are races on individual sections, which you will learn during the game.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and points common to the challenges and story modes.
Many possibilities are available for obtaining a higher level of driving: from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the online Autolog feature, which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides public communication.
Here’s another flaw that’s hard to understand; it’s an example from the last race in the sequence.
You and your car get into a subway tunnel (let’s assume it is), where you race on the rails in the dark (let’s assume it is).
Your speedometer shows figures from 150 to 200 km/h (assuming so), when a subway train suddenly crashes at your back, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For several days, our editorial staff discussed whether no one really thought for a second at the time of creating the game, or whether its creators really think we are such idiots.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video series is mostly pleasant, sometimes even stunning.
Although it is a pity that in some critical moments the quality of the recording, sometimes quite severely, decreases.
This is especially true for incidents with a large number of participants, where a good record wouldn’t help you much either.
The sound is fine; the soundtrack is for the amateur.
In order to please the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack 'included songs from different styles'; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
Need for Speed: Escape is pretty messy.
If the game had avoided clearly unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say Escape is the best part of NFS for the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a feeling of incompleteness.
Of course, this is a good pastime, but be prepared for the fact that the shortcomings will blind you as the airport spotlight.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenova:
The Czechs have a reputation as adversaries and skeptics of the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has caused significant differences between individual organizations.”
“I didn’t expect such a cruel war.”
“It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes, calms down and all players get used to their new roles,” EU Ambassador Milena Vicenova said.
She proved how much she adhered to her motto "Clear and Open about Europe" in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so simply and clearly that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the KU would be envious.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
“At first, critics said he was an ordinary gray office mouse that couldn’t perform any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed at how well he handled his role.”
“He is a person who can listen to the twenty-seven participating countries at the same time, communicate well with them and who has a clear idea of which way the EU should develop.”
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security issues in response to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number should I call?"; i.e. as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one is going to ban our cheeses.
Vicenova further focused on a program that was key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech Republic's presidency a success in the year before last.
The Czechs were dealing with an impending financial crisis; they overcame the crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the government at that time was a negative phenomenon that caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Currently, the Czech Republic is very busy in the EU.
As the Ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing fermentation.
In addition, it is necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very difficult, given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be scarce and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which less; all these issues are in the upcoming program.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans that she brought to Brussels: “About Europe, in an understandable language”.
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curved or round cucumbers, bananas of all sizes, or that someone is going to ban our varieties of cheese.
It is also going to use the EU environment more effectively and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
A multi-speed Europe is our future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered Euro-skeptics; as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive side of things.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are to blame: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful chairmanship of the Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what's the meeting about, the Visegrad Group again?' and he's not happy about it.
In the future, Vicenov expects mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.
Compared to the new European Federation, she considers the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe more realistic.
“We have countries both inside and outside the eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area, and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation.”
“For the first time, it has been said that countries that want to unite, while those that don’t want to can stay away.”
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe," Vicenova expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in advancing the rule that all issues affecting the whole EU should be discussed by all member states, not just the eurozone.
Brand history:
The innovator IBM is entering the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find the word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one is likely to be “long-lasting.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company’s longevity was laid down by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant unfolded (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means constantly moving towards the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and the company.
In the second century, we hope to achieve even more,” said Samuel J. Palmizano, the company’s current CEO, on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complicated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of caring for employees just as Batia in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms, and a sophisticated bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
Equally advanced are IBM’s long-term relationships with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company found brilliant application to talented people. It was one of the first global companies to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it an excellent choice.
It aligns with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, under which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently the Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
In the last few years, IBM has been organizing meetings, online brainstorming, during which many future innovations arise.
Not surprisingly, there are a lot of ideas - about half a million people work in the company.
An organization with a good reputation
The strong position of the company in business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
“From the outset, from the standpoint of IBM’s concept, it was an organization rather than a technology company,” Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor and author of the IBM book, told The Economist.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” adds Forrester Research’s George Colony.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
For a hundred years, IBM, or the “Blue Giant” as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most versatile technology company – developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services – from servers to nanotechnology.
She holds the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, five of her employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a barcode, and a floppy disk.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM this year became the second largest technology company (first place with Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking Forward
Not all of its products appealed to buyers and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is determined by moving forward, you can’t be emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That’s why IBM easily lays the foundations on multiple platforms – if they don’t work, it abandons them.
This differs, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is based and experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Promising technology
IBM’s main revenue comes from services, with about one-fifth in each case coming from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990, with half the capital, it was the strongest manufacturer of equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-income assets. At the same time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the amount of investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has increased by a record 120 percent; the company's net earnings have steadily increased.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything but its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM: From Cheese Knife to Space Flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original name "Corporation of Computing, Tabulation, Recording" was quite complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924. Originally, this was the name of the brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were laid by the merger of four companies whose history begins in the 1880s.
They possessed technologies such as the legendary "table watch", i.e. the clock that records the time when employees come and go from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who until 1930 also chaired the board of trustees of the company.
Flint hired a rival company director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
Then the head pushed the founder of IBM into the shadows - Watson's ideas remain the basis of an unshakable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and sale of various business equipment, from cheese knives and meat cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson's management, revenue doubled to nine million dollars, and the company began a large-scale expansion to all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his place in the chair of the director was taken by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM employees and computers helped NASA control spaceflight — to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 — the flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC that set the computer standards of the time, called the IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computer manufacturing to Chinese company Lenovo, simultaneously buying the consulting branch of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus fully concentrating on consulting and high-value-added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to use technology wisely in areas where it has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban management.
In Commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
IBM’s traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country located simultaneously in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM established its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague, where there is also a world-class speech recognition research group.
Regarding his unfaithful husband:
Yvette, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Daria Richtarzhova (53) said that it's over!
After her husband, Josef Richter, 53, became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova, 45, Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and has set out clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," said Richtarzhova.
When Darina Richtarzhova provided the shelter to Bartoshova at her home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Yvette to leave R<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>an after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to accept her husband’s romance; and now she finally said goodbye to him.
I don't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richtarzh and Bartoshova ever part, his wife will not receive him with open arms.
“He’s the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will kick him out.”
"However, he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a person with whom I have something to do," said Richtarzhova, adding that she has already freed herself from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
So far, Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yvette, I'm not going to change that."
“My wife has decided to leave her marriage on paper, and I respect that decision.”
“Our union is still functioning; I’m responsible for the repairs, the garden, the house and the shopping.”
"Darina and I communicate perfectly normal, only we no longer share a bed," Richter told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtarzhova finds a new love, he will not interfere with her.
“We don’t sleep together, and I don’t care where she goes, with whom or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I'm responsible," he said.
Women’s Worst Habits: Do They Affect You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually list them all at once.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines describing several female habits that make men angry?
SHOPPING
Is your spouse complaining that you are constantly shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one item each week?
Do you like to shop at big sales?
If so, then your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to somehow control their passion for shopping.
And yet, who among you will refuse to go shopping for clothes in search of perfectly seated clothes and try it (preferably in different colors) in the fitting rooms?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it can be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your soul mate to wait for you outside.
Eternal dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Oh, yeah?
Then you are part of a group of women who are obsessed with their appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to the constant complaints of partners on their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more often such complaints arise, the more women irritate them.
The most important thing is order and cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
Glass washing, vacuum cleaning, floor cleaning, dust cleaning, bathroom cleaning - at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for stepping on a clean tile in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on the window glass in the living room that was so difficult to clean?
In the event that you suffer from this “deviation,” try to realize that going to extremes is not good; and that in your family, order and cleanliness should not come first.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship, as well as your entire family.
Desire to command
"Throw your underwear in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towels shouldn't be on the floor."
If you make remarks to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps if men understood this, women would not have to command them so often.
Gossip Girl
Some women like to gossip, insult, and plot against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how and why.
From time to time, we all gossip.
Let’s be honest, that seems to be the nature of all women.
However, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise the rest. They, especially in the women's workforce, pose a greater danger to their environment.
Jagr and Vorachek's successful transfers helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful transfers of hockey striker Jaromir Jagra helped Philadelphia beat 5:3 on the ice of Carolina. He again became the most successful Czech player of the match.
In both cases, Claude Giroud used the experience of the thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another gear and was named the best player of the match.
Two successful transfers of the match also belonged to Yakub Vorachek, who played in the same team with Jagra.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he had predicted a great evening for Gira.
"I told him before the game that he would score a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel things like that," Jagr explained, after whose actions Giroud scored a goal at the first opportunity Flyers gave.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a "Czech footprint".
The closing Hurricanes Vorachek seized the puck and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the rounds.
A second before the first break home player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap with a numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second half again led the Flyers.
Especially fat.
He scored a third goal after Jagr's successful serve; later his shot was transformed into the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
“I like to play with him.”
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," Jagr said, praising his midfielder.
“I never thought I’d be playing with a hockey player like him at the end of my career.
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
“All these years in the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer's penalty, shortening the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger did a great job in our area."
"He hit the washer, I accelerated, and Reed crossed to the far end."
“I was aiming at him and I’m glad it worked,” Voracek said of his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to first place in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal defender Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an upper body injury.
Together with an experienced defender, the Canadiens lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a penalty shootout.
Tomas Plekanec was unable to score during one of their attacks.
More than the points lost, the home coach was saddened by the large number of injuries in the back row as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
“We finished the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young people.
“However, we can’t do anything about it, we just have to put up with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement for replacement, it was astonishing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
"What was our weakness," added defender P.K. Subban
After thirty attacks, Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0xBE>ej Pavelets helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The goals of the Jets, who interrupted the five-match series of defeats, were scored by five different players.
Dynamics of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed to operate in the former Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, travel agencies of the time mostly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, on vacation, Czech tourists went to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which entailed significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter was needed from that country; otherwise, individual travel was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered travel to the West, but you either had to stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or have “good friends” at the agency.
And that's not all.
A currency permit was necessary for travel to the West. It was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without a currency permit it was impossible to obtain money (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most often, the Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the emergence of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit persists to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus experienced a real revolution.
While before 1989 vacations in the GDR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox, which we no longer realize, is that until 1989 we could not freely visit the most popular currently Croatia, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the very beginning of 1990, the need for a visa to the neighboring countries of Western Europe was abolished. This marked the beginning of a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of traveling to the West. Everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, as their income at the time was insufficient for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism in that period was the desire to bring their own food (canned food, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech koruna. After decades, our tourists are finally free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income were rising, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights operated by charter airlines. Compared to the past, air travel has now become incredibly cheap thanks to the ability to order wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all the developed countries of the world, except the United States. This made our travel even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000. Great demand led to the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have been delivering Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter, flights from the Czech Republic will depart to twelve exotic destinations.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished the requirement to obtain a visa for Czech tourists. Thus, our country has permanently joined the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15,000 crowns per person during vacation abroad, including their expenses at their destination.
The general assembly must elect a president, the threat of pata returns
For about five months, Czech football has not had a president. There is a risk that the successor of Ivan Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will be held in Nymburk on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on which election rules to follow.
Without this, voting for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomasz Patzlik are eager to lead Czech football.
Hashek left his post in June. As he left, he urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future.
However, the Hasek era has again plunged football into a rift between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became quite obvious on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly came in vain to the National House in Prague, Smíchov, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no agreement as to who was entitled to vote at the general meeting – only the legal representatives or also the officials to whom the powers had been granted.
This point has since been partially settled by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law that representation based on the powers conferred is not possible.
Controversy over the rules of the election, however, continues.
The Executive Board was also not very helpful, although in its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it was mainly concerned with this issue.
Ideas about voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do you move on to round 3 and avoid a pat?
"The controversy is whether to follow the established norms or find a different model," says Dusan Svoboda, one of FACR's vice-presidents, who represents professional football in the association's management.
Based on the model provided for by the statute, the winner of the 3rd round is the candidate who has received great support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree to a compromise to consider the candidate with the highest number of votes in both chambers as the winner of the election.
The Czech side insists on the condition that the overall percentage of the winner must receive at least two-thirds of the votes.
"However, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; it would completely reject the concept of two chambers", Svoboda agrees with Moravia's arguments. He says it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing norms.
Slightly unexpectedly, Tomasz Patzlik agrees with his opinion, although according to the rules of the election, determined by the charter, Pelta is more satisfied than other candidates.
“I would like the election to be held in accordance with the constitution as much as possible.”
“I want to avoid all sorts of representative nonsense, as at the previous general meeting,” says the owner of Victoria Pilsen, who is a candidate for the first time; and in his remarks he largely contradicted Pelte.
Pelta remains an optimist.
He trusted that the new president would become known in Nymburk; he also hoped that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
“All the emotional fermentation will calm down after today’s expected entry of the national team to the European Championship.”
"Football will again be on a happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate," says the representative of Yablonets. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management both at the professional and regional levels.
Riley is more restrained.
“I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous.”
"This is not between representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"This could cause another breakdown of the general assembly."
"I hope common sense wins," Reichl said.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, separate talks took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight, which was to deliver, among others, Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Reichl to Podgorica, did not depart Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction. They were looking for an alternative to deliver part of the Executive Committee to the venue of the replay match.
After all, the ministerial meeting expected on Wednesday could be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobes, would like the opponents of the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
A lot is at stake: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV with the new directorate of Czech sport after Sazka’s financial problems.
Patzlik enters the presidential fight because he does not see a suitable candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of football players Pilsen Tomas Patzlik would see a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements for the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not even claim a high position.
“If there was a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and I would not participate in the fight.”
"But such a person has not yet been found," Paclik told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
Patzlik’s motive for joining the fight against Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl is to try to prevent Pelta, the alleged favorite of the elections, from joining the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R government.
Moreover, Patzlik emphasizes that if he wins, he will remain president only until 2013, when the next general meeting is planned.
In the future, he would like this position to be taken by an experienced top manager, not too attached to football life.
“I’ve talked to a few people that I could think of.”
"It was horrible for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they don't even want to have anything to do with Czech football."
"I would like to change that opinion," he said.
At present, the main disagreement between Patzlik and Pelta is related to the latter’s relationship with Roman Berber, president of the regional football association in Pilsen. Berber is a man of controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist who is able to influence the voices of the delegates of the general assembly.
Patzlik, therefore, considers it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berber, a capable businessman, it would be even more damaging to football," Patzlik said.
He hints at the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was recorded while wiretapping phones during a corruption investigation; Pelta managed to escape the verdict.
“I don’t know what prestige a win by Pelta would bring to football.
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Patzlik. He now does not mention his previous statement that he "will sell the club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president".
If Patzlik wins on Thursday, he could present a collaboration with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Patzlik supported before the September general assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He would be the first one I would turn to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can imagine him at the head of the team."
"But he can't run the association."
"I don't stick my nose in what I don't understand either," said Patzlik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of a judges' team led by Ludek Matsela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Patzlik claims that he will risk running the association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; from last summer he managed the team Pilsen, which with his help celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
“I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better.”
"To limit the influence of certain groups of people who tend to exert influence on the disciplinary and appeal board, which leads to disgusting situations," Patzlik said. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta Daniel Krzetinski.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money for sports from lottery fees.
“This is one of the key points that the new president should be dealing with.”
“If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they have to make it clear where the money is going,” he said.
Patzlik does not consider his association with the club Pilsen a burden, although he argues that the president of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be independent.
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, and Reichl with the Prague Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
“And yet I don’t see the point in hypocritically transferring my shares of Pilsen to someone else, since I’m going to be back there in six months,” says Patzlik.
Pelta promised new rules FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which will avoid the Electoral Pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for the new rules of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R in order to avoid disputes over the rules of election in the future.
Until Thursday’s talks in Nymburk, the official remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the pre-election struggle will significantly distract today’s expected success of our football team.
Prior to the failed election in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the election at the last moment before the last general meeting. A two-month delay could thus be useful to him to defend his ideas regarding football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"They feel that now is the time for someone to lead the association," the man, who is mainly affiliated with the Yablonec club, argues; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the association's executive committee.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“Unfortunately, the rules, which were not as perfect as we all thought, were adopted at a general meeting in June.”
"If different forms of representation were not adopted, we would already have a president from September," Pelta said.
He treated the rewriting of a key civil association document as a false target for delegates.
“If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I will take personal responsibility if this attempt fails.”
“This is a fundamental issue without which we cannot exist,” Pelta argues.
In addition, he says that he is not trying to stand out from the background of rivals.
In the past, he had already stated that he could present his cooperation with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl, whom he appreciated for his legal education; he was well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Patzlik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
“He’s been in football for over a year and he’s had some success.
"However, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by the methods of his election campaign."
"Also and therefore some of them now doubt his true identity," Pelta said of his competitor. Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his main weapon knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team should represent all football.
“I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemian case or the consequences of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“Immediately after that, I would focus on negotiating with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for the whole of football,” the 46-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of football head would not entail dismissals of staff.
"I will need to know the job instructions of individual employees." This was his message to the Insurance, where the prolonged period of inter-government causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general meeting, he believes that delegates will arrive in Nymburk on Thursday not in vain.
“If the only question is how to hold the third round, we can deal with that.”
“Football needs the trust it can only gain by finally electing its leader,” says Pelta, who remains optimistic two days before a key day in his career.
Raichl promises that under his leadership FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will begin to work actively
If Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl, the incumbent vice president, becomes president of the Czech Football Association at the meeting on Thursday, many people in the Association are rumored to be dissatisfied.
Reichl promises that if he is elected, it will be a time of hard work.
He wants to establish changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual areas in football.
He also promises to solve the Bohemian problem; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; raise more money for football; and continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I would like to focus on football in general.
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national teams, professional football and youth football events."
"I don't mean to say that I will do everything myself," Reichl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to allocate powers in the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area.”
"I will be very careful with the tasks, so that in each of these segments football has made big steps forward."
“It’s probably not going to please many people because it would mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others,” he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly made him doubt his candidacy.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if there is any sense in it; and that I will not be surrounded by people sticking sticks in my wheels and questioning my every step," he explained his doubts.
"However, many people have told me that I should not give up, otherwise others will come."
“It’s a trust I can’t throw away,” he said.
What’s more, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Hasek.
“A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don’t want to take it all away.”
"There have been processes that can bring results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the Association could return to what it was before Hasek.
“I believe in a systematic approach, and this is something that Mirek Pelta is hardly competent in.”
“He’s surrounded by people who would play football so that it’s only accessible to the chosen ones.”
"I can be accused of many things, but certainly not of subjectivity."
“I’m trying to be objective.”
“I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just an elected minority,” Reichl said.
Moreover, he denies the accusations that he will be only the president of the Czech Republic.
“While many people are trying to argue otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia.”
"For example, it is time to think about the division of the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Reichl said.
While the presidential fight entered the manager of the club Pilsen Tomasz Patzlik, Reichl does not dare to assess his chances of victory.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me its vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious successes," said Reichl. He attributes to his successes the savings of tens of millions of crowns on unprofitable contracts, negotiations on contracts with television and negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, he partially blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was "excluded from the process of returning credit to Czech football", he considers another rival, Patzlik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen this year."
“If he is elected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Hashek started, without significant personnel changes in the committees.”
"He would not distort the facts to his advantage," Reichl said of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump into the water
Yulia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can try on the incredible water of Europe - and relax the tired body in the jacuzzi after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
One thing Iris Meder could not do without during her research trips for the past year and a half: without her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, swam to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
She hurried to add every pool she liked to her notebook – with important details about the building’s construction and history.
Architecture historian Meder has inspected more than 200 swimming pools – and has now gathered impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden (The Joys of Bathing), which includes everything from public swimming pools in Munich to historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and “functional concrete buildings” in Taunus.
Her "journey to the most unusual swimming pools in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited swimming pools in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for the sport, Meder says, but the water is different.
The only drawback is that swimmers have to put up with the blue tile and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the enticing smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
“I once asked myself why swimming pools always have to be so horrible,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Slamming in the pool and exquisite oils in the sauna is a health factor in baths that is so significant because, according to Meder, all the senses are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real eye-catcher if builders take on this kind of work. "Instead of the pool floor, you have the surface of the water."
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles and trampolines.
The 190-page illustrated edition of “The Joy of Bathing” contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases – and makes you want to jump into the water.
The water collector Meder discovered several outstanding specimens during her research in Hungary.
She discovered nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (Cave Bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jasberen), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old Bud<0xC4><0x9B><0xC4><0x8D>ín Ce.
Of the many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is a stunning view. You can see all of Zurich from the rooftop swimming pool or view the snow-capped Arlberg from the outdoor pool in St. Anton. And the steam room has a window that allows you to see what is happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits bathers in Langenfeld. The aqua cathedral in Etztal looks like a UFO, just landed in the Alps.
In winter, a pair of three open shells rises from it, which seem quite small against the background of the Ettal Mountains.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
The pool collector Meder did not meet the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell gray. The baths named after Arpad in Bekeszczaba smell of oil so much that it can be difficult for you to believe that you are in a wellness source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in alkaline water. The water is almost black from the silt, which sticks to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool - a wellness experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was at some point disappointed in her search for beautiful places to swim. When she tried to visit the outdoor pool of the Czech Baths in Luga<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she found that the area was sealed.
The baths, designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovi<0xC4><0x87> in 1902, were closed.
When Meder peered into the exposed windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on the hot tracks is the amazing swimming pool in the Black Forest - the Palace of Thermal Waters in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already gone through three stages of construction. You will find not only neo-Romanesque elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also a Moorish Alhambra-style hall added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite swimming pool of the pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because she comes from the Black Forest.
“It’s a real achievement to combine such different architectural styles so skillfully,” Meder says.
Dive into the thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a secondary occupation.
Speculation of agricultural products
Deutsche Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Teaves
Will the Deutsche Bank stop selling agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann gave the task to the working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the poor around the world.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg - Heidelberg
For German citizens, the situation is clear. According to one survey, 84 percent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of respondents are demanding that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products as trade exacerbates the problems facing the world’s poorest people.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schumann, demonstrates that gambling on the world’s commodity exchanges raises prices – and banks are thus involved in world hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign is aimed directly at the head of the Deutsche Bank, Joseph Ackermann, although major banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade in the same way.
Initially, commodity rates were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand – and profit at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism. He promised to investigate the allegations and stated that no trade "is not worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the board of directors of Deutsche Bank - with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decrease or stop altogether.
Ackermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch President Thilo Bode was delighted with the news, emphasizing his criticism of the financial sector. "Bets on rising food prices are an egregious example of how thoughtlessly banks are now acting against common interests."
As the bank’s chief lobbyist, Ackermann has a certain duty, according to Bode.
“The Deutsche Bank should remove from its portfolio all investments that make money bets on food prices,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter whether it’s starving people or Deutsche Bank’s reputation.”
Ackermann’s quick reaction is surprising at first, but in the meantime the director would like to have a flawless image just a few months before the end of his stay in the office.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not move to the supervisory board as planned.
The elimination of controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also practically does not need to worry about costs - his successor will have to deal with the consequences.
One in two would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday. The study was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on November 7 and 8, and 1001 people took part.
No more than eleven percent believe that investments that bet on the price of food are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they found their bank involved in such trading. According to the study, every second would withdraw deposits that ultimately lead to commodity speculation.
43% would recommend leaving the bank, 49% said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st Century House in Vienna
Pavilion in a new place
Ingeborg Winsowski
An architectural story with ups, downs and happy endings. The Austrian pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and was abandoned.
It is now being reopened as an exhibition centre.
The Pavilion of Austria, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a famous example of modern post-war architecture with its simple shapes, glass halls, bold that expressed faith in technical progress.
The Schwanzer pavilion won the Grand Prix of Architecture in 1958 for its light floating structure made of steel and glass.
The building is considered a landmark in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World's Fair.
Eventually, it became world-famous in 1973 for its legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and its sister, the bowl-shaped building.
The pavilion, conceived as a building for temporary exhibitions, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna's South Railway Station, transformed and opened as a 20th-century museum in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "20th-century house" for this reason.
However, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls on which to hang works of art, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition has been getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Kri<0xC5><0xA1>anitz has now restored the pavilion, which was called the "21st century house" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is a branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening - in all senses a joyful event.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, contributed to the new start.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a skater in her youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, persuaded politicians and curators to continue the reconstruction, raised public funds and private donations and made a decision on how
The new museum was to accommodate the permanent exhibition of the Fritz Wotruba Foundation, a cafe and a bookstore along with contemporary art. An office building was also to be built.
Strict control & limited budget
Kri<0xC5><0xA1>anitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession by Josef Olbrich, and won the contest, but he also studied with Schwantz at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was for him an "exceptionally important place", where he attended exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and knew the challenges that stood in front of the building, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that arose during the last restructuring were much more serious. The building was a "energy absorber", says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, fiberglass-reinforced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with high-strength safety glass.
The steel bars of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors have created space for a new use of the building, the fallen light well between the building and the street provides lighting – a practically new building, but still an elegant Schwantzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was painted in the old red-brown color of corrosion protection.
The cinema hall is the same as it used to be.
All this under strict control of the museum administration and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and would have been approved by the museum's management," Krishanitz says, pointing to the uneven flooring in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light, despite the limitations, challenges and transformations.
Kri<0xC5><0xA1>anitz recently noted that the pavilion “from Brussels” was rude – a typical story of “a drop in the city”.
Such architecture is "always out of place" and nevertheless wants to "stimulate real awareness".
The 21st-century house is in the very right place, as unexpected luck has occurred in the planning of the city. A completely redesigned "main station quarter" with offices and residential real estate is growing around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may occur. The 21st-century house may be supplemented by the second building of Kri<0xC5><0xA1>anitz - collector Francesca von Habsburg has acquired the Temporary Exhibition Hall of Berlin and is reportedly negotiating with the city about its location next door in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans multimillion-dollar winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has unveiled an anti-crisis plan to avoid cancellations of trains in the winter.
The number of staff should double.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn’s internal crisis plan, Bild newspaper reports that a total investment of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million is planned until 2015.
The investment is intended to increase the efficiency of locomotives and the railway network even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and engaged employees involved in snow removal from tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice before the start of work and 90 percent of the necessary arrows within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of train cancellations and delays this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger transportation, as it lacked reserves at a time of worsening weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays with the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also had to check the axes of ICE trains much more often for years after one of the ICE trains broke the axis at Cologne’s main station.
Deutsche Bank to pay millions of pounds in U.S. fines
New troubles have come in the wake of unrest over Josef Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a multi-million pound fine in the US.
As if Deutsche Bank had little trouble at home, the past of the industrial giant in the US has now caught up with it. Deutsche Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million euros) to settle disputes that arose after the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Unions Authority (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of the largest banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and pulled down credit unions.
“We are delighted that we have resolved this issue without going to court,” a spokesperson for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
In the agreement, the bank did not admit its guilt.
The same is true for Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the prompt response from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for losses that spill over from billions.
This is the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and filed a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called securities backed by a pool of mortgage loans.
They are backed by internal loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when the real estate bubble in the United States burst in 2007.
American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 on the crest of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the US are still struggling with the storm.
Investors and regulators have raised a large number of claims, demanding compensation or punishing fraudsters.
Behind the largest wave of claims is the Federal Agency for Housing Financing (FHFA).
It accuses 18 major international banks of having purchased collateral agreements worth about $200 billion from American credit institutions Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank also faces the threat of prosecution by the FHFA over numerous agreements worth a total of $14.2 billion concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires the bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, to take responsibility for “substantial losses”, but has not yet specified the exact amount.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and announced its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests $10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares totaling more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the largest American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM’s annual report changed his mind about investing in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have realized much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett’s investment was seen as a chivalrous act.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, has now received the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the American business channel CNBC, Buffett said that since March he bought shares of IBM for a total amount of 10.7 billion dollars.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has become one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM did not know anything about his involvement until recently.
He praised the management, which managed to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
For a long time, IBM focused on high-yield IT services such as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, who is now more than 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided tech companies.
He claimed that he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
and invested, for example, in rail freight, lubricants and machinery.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Municher Rück), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and with the help of skillful investments built on its basis one of the most expensive companies in the world.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable instinct for making money earned him the nickname “Oracle of Omaha.”
IBM’s share price rose one percent before markets opened after Buffett’s announcement of investments.
The “Blue Giant,” as IBM is also called, is worth more than $ 220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
The Imminent Danger
After the discovery of the “cell in Zwickau” Turkish media began to doubt the rule of law in Germany.
One newspaper speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now rising to the surface again.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a reaction to this report in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community in Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news brought to life long forgotten fears. Such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks have not occurred since the arson attacks in Melln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network now discovered has a scale that is not yet fully understood.
“Revival of a bloody ideology?” was the headline of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a covert informant of the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be drawn into a right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, commemorating the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket in front of the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin in a ceremony with the participation of German and Turkish politicians celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on the hiring of labor.
The cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
Coverage in some Turkish media was like a slap in the face. "Gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriyet also did not miss the opportunity to draw this parallel.
"Begins to smell bad" is the name of Ahmet Kyulahji's column.
He notes that people who paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany were killed.
The behaviour of the police and the subsequent successful raid were sharply criticized in German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities hadn’t thought earlier about keeping an eye on suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have come to a rather harsh rhetoric. "If they continue to act as clumsily, migrants will have no choice but armed self-defense."
“It will be the best self-defense.”
"Peace in Germany depends very much on how the entire network is opened and on the lawfulness of the punishment," Selen wrote.
The crimes of Melln and Solingen in the 1990s were an example of how the peace in Germany was under threat.
A photograph of the burned ruins in Solingen is deeply imprinted in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks living here so clearly that they are in danger, and the Germans that distrust and indifference can turn into real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at that time mainly condemned the failures of the German police after the attacks. Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Melln.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president after the arson attacks in Solingen, but his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel took part in a memorial ceremony in Cologne.
It was as if he was determining the value of a man by the taxes he paid.
The current coverage in the Turkish media once again showed how deepened since then the mistrust of many German Turks to the current German state.
By clearly showing what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
The Zurich Lake Banking Scandal
Most of the leading risky banks in Europe are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been struggling with one crisis or another ever since.
Now the German must return him to the right course.
Alex Weber had no idea he was going to play this role.
In July, after his spectacular resignation from the post of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would start working in an equally spectacular position - Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Weber was clearly enthusiastic, praising Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its renewed strength, and making some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
“UBS has managed to change for the better.”
“I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Gruebel.”
But in September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
The UBS trader in London bypassed the bank’s security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Gruebel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS is considered ill, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will take the post of chairman of the council in May, and not in 2013.
It's not going to be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist of the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He was suddenly responsible for the bank’s strategy, which proved once again that he had long earned the title of “the biggest banking scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, is very large – until recently it managed the largest assets in the world – and on the other – it has not come out of scandals for years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank spares nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The bank combined the image of a secretive and resilient but skillful asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus having more wealthy clients’ money in management than any other bank in the world.
and as an investment bank entered the league of the largest banks in the world.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking who has long taught at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich, explains: “I have always led my students to UBS as an example of a good bank.”
“Knowing what we know now, you may ask how I could be so wrong.”
He was really, really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffley – who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker – unexpectedly stepped down from his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he had left.
The investment division of the bank tried to play on subprime securities and was forced to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS reported a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The bank has indeed managed to find investors – but investors that many bankers would have politely declined until recently – one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund so secretive that even its name has not been disclosed.
That was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and chairman Marcel Ospel – Switzerland’s second-highest-paid chairman of the board in 2006 – resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster occurred. Due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was in danger of collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank bought toxic securities from UBS for an undisclosed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a mandatory conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country realized the dramatic consequences of having huge banks settle in a small country.
After all, UBS’s total balance sheet in 2007 was five times larger than all of Switzerland’s production (see graph).
“We won’t be able to save UBS a second time,” said bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the United States and said it was ready to hand over data from wealthy customers who may have been evading taxes with the bank’s help.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursement of undue business income plus fines.
UBS has thus more or less admitted that it was a tool of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in the fight for rich clients – the veil of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors have since resigned, and
The customer’s money has begun.
Over the past few months, the bank has lost credibility in both of its main areas of activity – in investing due to unsuccessful speculation and in asset management as a result of helping and encouraging tax evasion.
And only everything calmed down and it began to seem that UBS managed to turn the situation around, as happened this crash with the scammer-trader. One single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear - risk management in the investment department is not working yet.
“The Adoboli incident has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of one of Germany’s largest banks also has no doubts: “The problem with UBS is that it doesn’t have a tool to control risk.”
Precaution has long made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world’s largest assets – not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine republic or not.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unwavering reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the refined taste of chocolate.
UBS’s Zurich headquarters still fits the image of a worthy Swiss private bank – only it’s a bit larger.
Its location is a classic in itself.
The head office of the bank is located in Zurich on the Bahnhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, surrounded by the snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli here you can find such jewelry companies as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been located here for hundreds of years - from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace and elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marbled walls there are large leather sofas. Next to the bank emblem, a large indicator "Safe".
UBS knows what its customers need – reliability.
But both of Switzerland’s largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point abandoned Swiss concepts of banking – or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He would not like to see his name in the newspaper - like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big - in particular, in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
The Swiss have nothing to add.
"And if there is anything, it means that they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it first big profits - and then a fiasco. No other financial institution in Europe lost so much money in the jungle of subprime assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“That Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the country’s history,” Lucas Hessig writes in his book The Collapse of UBS.
Politicians have approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have gone so far?
If you ask Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed that was already too big for little Switzerland at the time of the merger – and a bank that continued to grow.
This was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a wealthy but degree bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not as wealthy, but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly had access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin the all-powerful wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Wulffley, CEO of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wulffley and Ospel were the dream team,” says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
“Wulffley, an outstanding intellectual, humble and profoundly understanding of models and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instinct, who has gone all the way up, starting with an intern at a bank.”
But Ospel eventually relied on Wulffley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were real," Geiger says.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember well the meetings of the board members, at which Wolffley always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he headed the "tournament table", where the successes of the banks were recorded.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to do part of the way.
UBS was the largest player in currency and government securities trading.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weakness. Under the parameter, which in banking terminology is called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS has had failures in American mortgage products.
To close the hole, UBS got involved in an adventure that almost cost him his life.
Seeking growth, the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in US subprime securities.
This evolved into a large mechanism that pooled securities based on American mortgages and sold them further—continuing to bear the risks itself.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
“UBS was buying until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire,” said bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the rise, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to put the bank in order proved more difficult than it seemed at first.
Posts at UBS have become a child’s game with chairs and to this day remain unreliable.
Anyone who runs this huge bank faces an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Bank analyst Geiger already has an idea - to abandon investment banking, focus on asset management and forget about their Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not yet ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activities need to be significantly narrowed.
The bank’s new chief executive, Sergio Ermotti, plans to unveil his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually only seen as a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly parted ways with his predecessor Grubel.
In the past, he managed to show character and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, heads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to bring the investment bank back to the state it was in in the mid-1990s.
It will cut 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions are probably asked by Axel Weber.
Publicly, he has so far only said that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe pull US stock market down
The impending recession in Europe has worsened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The continent’s decline in industrial production has dampened hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in its infancy.
The general relief that followed the change of governments in Rome and Athens was not reinforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half-full rather than half-empty — but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index closed at 12.078 with a drop of 0.6 percent.
The barometer of the market during trading fluctuated between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, falling by one percent.
The Nasdaq technology index lost 0.8 percent, trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 percent, closing at 5,985 points.
Industry in 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced production and is adjusting towards the end of growth.
Eurostat reported that in September, the companies produced two percent less than in the previous month.
This message plunged American investors into skepticism. "We are not on an island. We depend on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said Europe was unlikely to shake off the recession quickly and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these fears. In an interview with CNBC, he said it was still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it takes to end the crisis.
Therefore, in his opinion, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffett dumped a decades-old principle in the garbage can and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM of more than ten billion dollars raised the price of shares of this oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
The stock closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett said he paid an average of $170 per share and now holds a 5.5 percent stake.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathway fell by 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell by 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted into cash almost all of its remaining share of the Construction Bank of China, earning $ 6.6 billion.
The bank mainly plans to maintain its capital quota with net sales profits to meet tighter regulations.
Aircraft manufacturer Boeing won by reducing losses on the Dow-Jones.
The stock price rose 1.5 percent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 series aircraft worth a total of $18 billion.
Including the option to buy another 20 aircraft, the total amount is actually $ 26 billion.
Approximately 710 million shares have changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of 719 companies rose, 2,281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.
Shares of 630 companies ended trading in growth, 1913 fell and 82 remained at the same level on the Nasdaq with a turnover of 1.38 billion shares.
Crows fill cities.
Gracians are considered problematic birds in many places. Experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to drive them out of the cities.
Some love birds, others would like to get rid of them as soon as possible. Crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents complaining of dirt and noise are becoming more and more in many settlements.
The solution to the bird problem, however, has not yet been achieved.
At the first symposium dedicated to crows in the city of Leer in East Frisia, experts argued that it is no longer possible to drive crows out of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservationists argued that the root of the problem in cities was in the migration of specially protected grazers, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction, and cutting down traditional nesting trees made life more difficult for birds.
The crows are guarded.
In the town of Zeest in Westphalia and in the northwest in Jever, Diepholz, Achim near Bremen and Lere there are large colonies with more than 600 parent couples.
A controversial project to shoot crows in Leer caused disapproving headlines in 2005.
Critics described catching birds in traps and sticking them with sticks as a special cruelty.
“Normal movement and intimidation do nothing,” said architect and landscape designer Werner Klever of Leer.
Knocking down nests with water jets or cutting down trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals are scattered, and large colonies are divided and spread to other areas.”
Scaring is possible only as an exception near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We have to live with them. Getting rid of them is not an option."
In isolation from the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, - says the mayor of Lera, Wolfgang Kölner.
A combination of scaring birds away from sheltered areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be an option.
"Information stands instead of chainsaws" - was the slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We must be confident to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands provide information about the lives of very clever crows.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jurgens also expressed her opinion on complaints about noise made by birds. "Noise transmits a lot of information. They have a lot to say to each other."
The wit and ingenuity of these birds have entered the legends. Gra<0xC4><0x8D>i often not only use tools to capture the beloved piece, but also make the tools themselves.
Behavior researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested a measure of bird’s mind on four hawks.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that you need to knock on the board to get a moth larva.
Without much training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the board.
In another experiment, the clever grahams had to solve a more complex problem.
Researchers put a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get their prey with their beaks.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used the wire to make the hooks and used the hooks to hook the bucket by the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players managed to do this from the first attempt.
Ronaldo takes Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of Bosniaks and Turks for last-minute victory were not long lasting.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the last places in the Euro 2012 championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1), perfecting its fifth Euro exit after 0:0 in the first stage.
The Czechs had enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of the playoffs against the outsider of Montenegro after a clean victory in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss their chance by playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloz (80th) scored the remaining goals for Portugal.
Former professional Bundesliga player from Wolfsburg Zvezdan Misimovic and Captain Emir Spahic reduced the difference of two points thanks to the resulting penalty shootout in the 41st minute and the goal in the 65th for Bosnia.
Sena Luli<0xC4><0x87> received a second yellow card in the 54th minute.
Portugal has already knocked Bosnia out of the 2010 FIFA World Cup playoffs in South Africa.
Portugal made a great start at Lisbon’s Estádio da Luz.
Ronaldo took an early start, throwing a free kick into the goal from about 30 meters.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-range abilities, from the 25-meter mark increasing the score to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not open the score in the first half hour, got their first opportunity thanks to the striker Edin D<0xC5><0xBE>eko.
Former Wolfsburg player from the leader of the English championship Manchester City in the 33rd minute sent the ball with his head to the bottom edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line.
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Then the focus was judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
Following the attack on Elder Postiga in the penalty area of the Bosnians in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player simulated and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a questionable penalty for playing hand-to-hand after Fabius Quentan's foul - Misimovic realized it.
After a break, the vice-champion of Europe in 2004 secured the score with four more goals.
Petr Jiracek dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championships will be held for the fifth time in a row.
Luck also smiled at the team of coach Michal Bielek and the Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlets (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake at the very beginning that could have been catastrophic.
Goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech in the 9th minute thanks to an instantaneous reflex prevented a potential auto goal of Tomasz Siwok.
The best chances in Montenegro were when there was a duet of Stevan Joveti<0xC4><0x87> and Dejan Damjanovi<0xC4><0x87> on the field.
Damjanovic in the 40th minute struck from the edge of the penalty area and almost scored a goal Czech.
After the break, the rod saved the already battered world-class goalkeeper of the Czech Republic after the forward of FC Seoul left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks could not play better than a 0:0 draw in Zagreb.
Although there is little doubt now that coach Guus Hiddink will now vacate a seat on the bench of the team that reached third place in 2002, the Croats are in the final round of the European Championship for the fourth time.
The Turks almost managed to start perfectly in front of 31,000 spectators at Maximir Stadium.
The long shot of Seljuk Inan in the seventh minute hit the stand, and the attacker Kazym Kazym failed to hit the ball into the net.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly took control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
Bundesliga legionaries Daniel Pranich (Bayern, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjuki<0xC4><0x87> of the Wolfsburg team, who gave way to Ivan Peri<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x87> from Dortmund in the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is going to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro entry since Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team - which already looked confident in its place after a 4-0 win in the first stage - took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to a goal by Stephen Ward.
Konstantin Vasiliev from the guest team equalized the score in the 57th minute.
Ireland from the start took a good pace, but only in the 23rd minute Robbie Keane from Los Angeles made the first clean goal.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from leading Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Bypassing the defense of goalkeeper Paul Londonak, Ward was in the right place and, dropping the ball across the line, changed the score by 1: 0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software maker, SAP, plans to invest billions and nearly double its workforce in China in the next few years.
The Dax-listed company said on Thursday it plans to invest about $2 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 billion) until 2015.
“We will create more R&D opportunities and employ thousands of people,” said Bill McDermott, one of SAP’s executive directors, in a statement at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
The staff of 2,500 people should grow to 4,500.
The world leader in industrial software plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
In this booming country, there are about 4,000 SAP customers out of more than 176,000 worldwide.
Counting on China’s growth is an important component of the Dax-listed company’s 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase its turnover to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Waldorf-based company earned about 12.5 billion euros.
The software vendor’s business, with 55,000 employees worldwide, looks better than ever.
SAP has been present in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to change the scale of our operations,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth by relying on informatization in China.”
Mass killings are a human dimension
Peter Englund’s tense and very good new book, Beauty and Sorrow: A Personal History of the First World War, begins with a long list of actors from which the heart freezes.
Here’s a tip to read on: Carefully cut out this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund narrates, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon at the moments when, like one of these men and women, you stray from the road and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he’s written now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as “a work on anti-history.”
There are few known names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, skilful journalists, or discussions of tactics and military equipment.
It’s not so much a book about what was, he explains, as “a book about what it was like.” It’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences and a state of mind.”
Beauty and Sorrow brings together the experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and nerd scientists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone will be taken prisoner, lose an arm or a leg, go crazy or die.
Their lives flicker here like church candles: new ones are added to a multitude of others, and some are extinguished at this time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is an amendment to the notion that World War I was only a heavy trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully gives a panorama of other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Beehives fall on the soldiers in this book; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolvable problem is the tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the start.
War covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of smokeless gunpowder.
When a cannonade is heard nearby, and you are a woman and you are at home with children, will you stay in place or run away?
Either way, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening and in general why it is necessary to fight in this war.
“The lack of facts,” says Mr. Englund, “is replenished by conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows the fate of men such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas Navy.
Their stories are mostly taken from memoirs, letters, and other materials already published.
The stories of their lives may be scary or exciting, but they are extremely vivid thanks to the small moments and fragmentary details collected by Mr. Englund.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with it.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, erzac everywhere."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about ersatz foods in Germany.
He describes "meat from pressed rice cooked in lamb's fat (and decorated with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato peel; shoes made of wood."
He notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes permitted in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American notices in himself the craving for cruelty and says about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men were created for, and not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a bestseller and claim that this show is civilization and under your starchy shirt."
The British soldier, on the contrary, notices that he is likely to die and no one will notice or grieve.
“When a person puts up with the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen in front of the public,” he writes.
But the opposite is terribly similar to a “convicted man who is hanged secretly.”
Other remarks concern old Europe, which is falling apart, and new types of fear.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” Mr. Englund writes, “a war of factories.”
He notes the arrival of what he calls "a new look in the bestiary of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-stitched suit who arranges a massacre sitting at a desk."
People act in an unforeseen way: lowly deeds are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who tried their best to get sexually transmitted diseases from prostitutes in order to avoid serving at the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrheal pus, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
"The desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which often led to lifelong blindness."
Translated from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose is flexible but discreet, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war “liberated completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassel's The Great War and Modern Memory, or novels such as Erich-Maria Remarque's On the Western Front Without Change, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unconventional pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending I can remember in nonfiction.
I'm not going to tell him.
But it’s like he reached out from a book to a page with a list of characters, grabbed it from your hands and lit it with a match.
After the previous mistake - a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some wearing protective helmets.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because Zuccotti Park was supposed to be the least crowded at that time.
The operation was kept secret from everyone except a few high-ranking officers, the others were first told they were going to exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the events, his presence underscoring how much importance the Department of Police attached to the operation.
There could be no question of repeating episodes of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which was contrary to the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation began to free Zuccotti Park from protesters.
The authorities prepared, watching as the occupation unfolded in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were held on Randels Island with Zuccotti as its target.
Authorities have increased the number of so-called riot training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers - referring to Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came “at the last minute,” said a source familiar with the orders, which referred to the task only as “training”.
“The few cops I know who were called to this case weren’t told they were being sent to Zuccotti Park,” said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zuccotti Park were in the highest positions in the department."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that the city learned.
On October 14, authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated before hundreds of protesters rushed inside ahead of schedule after hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved members of various police units, including forces from the districts, a team of police officers who were usually used to control the criminal neighborhood.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and leave the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to attack.
“It was the right thing to do when there was the least crowd in the park,” he said.
Rescue vehicles with floodlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
Floodlights and pre-recorded announcements from loudspeakers seem to have intimidated many protesters.
When administration officers in their blue windbreakers entered the park, many protesters simply packed their bags and left.
Police said the tents were not touched until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack up.
Other groups of police officers, according to eyewitnesses, gathered around the perimeter to enter in case arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a spokesman for the head of the police department, said this was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police operate and that the police treated them rudely.
Mr. Brown said that cars with TV cameras on Church Street, along the park’s western border, could be taking pictures.
As police moved west through a heap of protesters’ personal belongings, including bags, plastic mats and plastic bags full of clothes, the Sanitary Department teams followed her, collecting what had been thrown.
Some of the protesters who refused to leave were dragged out, photos of this soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took up positions near the camp kitchen, near the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police entered, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp chained themselves by the hands.
And two men chained themselves to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Rescue workers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until around 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleaning operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Brown said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “disturbance of public order and resistance to detention,” he said.
The highest ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the department's detective police, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “did not lead the operation,” Mr. Brown said.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they had to enter.
The barriers were placed on Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw police expand the perimeter even further beyond Zuccotti Park from these positions.
At one point, observers saw a group of policemen, many with shields, pushing people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one protester jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, drained air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one policeman and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The trade union of school staff will sue the city for dismissal
The union, representing hundreds of school attendant staff who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students study.
The lawsuit is probably the last recourse available to the District Council 37 union trying to rescind the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, the coordinator for working with parents and other employees who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their jobs on October 7 as a result of what union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds managed by groups of workers to close the hole in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically rejected the accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, school Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget they signed in June.
One council member objected, telling him that nowhere in the budget was there any indication that school support staff would be fired.
Representatives from 37 county councils said they filed a notice of claims, warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit was filed against them; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce a formal filing with the state's Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will identify Mr. Wolcott and the City Department of Education as defendants and list eight of the workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint available to the New York Times, the union has focused on a series of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, arguing that poor schools have lost more assistants because they are chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island, and there were few redundancies in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school attendants lost seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at Free High School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says: “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill budget gaps.”
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and she also lost money when the city changed the way it counted the extra funding for every poor student enrolled in school.
The union also argues that school principals may have been misled by the language of the notice allowing parents’ coordinators to be fired.
The notice used the word "exceeding", although "exceeding" is more often said when a teacher moves from a school payroll to a list of existing employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six coordinators for working with parents were fired,” the draft lawsuit says, “and not just transferred.”
The mission is over, the Congress is ready for an agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is due to consider a resolution put forward by Chairman John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph E. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), which praises Libyans for their successful uprising and U.S. troops for their “rebellion.”
“The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the courageous people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"This is a confirmation of the support of both parties for their democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but not a single discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and with the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the votes of both parties and never got a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut funding for the U.S. operation in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory – when Congress is angry enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not angry enough to actually knock the ground out of its way.
Events overtook the indecision of Congress
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate is now ready for action.
The Foreign Affairs Committee’s resolution “admires the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary perseverance in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measures get the full support of the Foreign Affairs Council or split lawmakers like the June bill?
The last version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans on the Committee.
Luger’s spokesman said on Monday he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives is due to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a top legislative priority for nearly every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
The measure, proposed by House Representative Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), would be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be put to a plenary vote by Congress of that convocation.
Other legislators have so far failed to bring their amendments to the plenary, but not because they did not try.
Goodlat's amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that address a wide range of issues that were introduced in that convocation.
Some were duplicated — the same bill was being tabled in the House of Representatives and in the Senate — others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendments on a balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and a few more on "control over federal spending".
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors – mostly newly elected Republicans wishing to embellish their resumes – the opportunity to boast that they have “proposed” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote in favour of an amendment on a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of members of Congress, and the member of the House of Representatives José Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed many amendments to guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as has another banning the burning of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states object to them.
As much as members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are not advancing faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th they made 66.
This rate is dim compared to the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment that was passed, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced into Congress in 1789.
“Beaten but not defeated,” Giffords said in her first television interview after the attack.
Ten months after a gunman shot her in the face at a public event in Tucson, House of Representatives member Gabrielle Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on a federal channel on Monday evening, sang a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Return Tomorrow" and said she wanted more to recover than she did.
Appearing on the ABC News program 20/20 with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to formulate suggestions and needed help walking.
The program showed her the difficult way to recover from a bullet-inflicted injury that crushed the skull and punctured the left side of the brain, going from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the bill on the marginal debt.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and called her recovery “difficult.”
When Sawyer was asked how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords said, “Very good.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hour-long special 20/20, which aired ahead of the release of the couple’s new book, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.
The special edition told about the recovery of Giffords after the shooting on January 8.
In a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Nod your head.
Pull out your lips.
And then her first word: "What."
A few days later, Giffords uttered the second word, “toast,” asking her to change her breakfast menu.
ABC’s video shows music playing a central role in Giffords’ recovery: We see the congressman singing along with the doctors “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” by Cindy Lauper and Tom Petty’s “Free Fall.”
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she does not remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he read Giffords an article in the newspaper about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him to ask about the six who were killed at the time.
Suspected assailant, Jerd Lee Loughner, is being held in Missouri prison and undergoing forced treatment pending trial.
“A lot of people have died,” Giffords Sawyer said.
"Heavy, heavy, heavy."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, "I'm beaten."
“I said, ‘Gabby, you’re not defeated,’” Kelly said.
You're just beaten.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better, and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more pity than respect.
The event was a holiday on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of helplessness, disappointment and loss.
At the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines lined up around him.
The tuxedo audience applauded him standing up.
“The military was seen as heroes,” said David Salzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, which was also attended by the then chairman of the Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
“They were treated like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I think the organizers wanted the best.
I know that. I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The very opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been established between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired, American public.
The troops are being praised for their sacrifices.
But praise has its price, military officials say.
The audience increasingly behaves as if they feel pity for people in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and soon left for Afghanistan.
“But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us like unfortunate people.”
This is a sensitive topic for military leaders who don’t want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger faced by returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity take place quietly and only between combat veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat as Marines, retired colonel Mark Canshun warned them that non-Army people would look at their service from two angles.
Some will look at them with admiration because they crushed the rebels and went to exotic places.
Others will wonder if “there’s a cruel, evil veteran hiding under the mask,” said Canshun, who fought in Iraq and returned to a senior government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he said, he felt some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could withstand the strain of responsible work in Washington right after the campaign.
Canshun recalls saying to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative effect."
The embarrassment experienced by the military comes in part from America’s indifference to war.
Victories on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that is little acquainted with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value war heroism as we did in World War II,” said retired lieutenant-general David Barnow, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public mainly focuses on the depth of the soldier’s suffering.
Troops are judged by the number of campaigns they have made, by the number of comrades they have lost, or by the scale of their losses.
The army faces growing pressure from anti-rape advocates
This week, a historic court hearing is set to decide whether to pass a lawsuit by 28 men and women against the army on charges of non-resistance to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the next one.
Private first class Elizabeth Lyman is 25 years old and at 11 weeks pregnant, according to her, was raped at night by her colleague.
It was in October 2008, she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Airfield, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend and met a male colleague carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
“It was a red flag,” Lyman said.
But a native of Texas has eased her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts then."
Minutes after they entered Lyman’s room, a man approached her from behind, knocked her down and raped her, she says.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be eagerly awaiting a court ruling at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether to go to court on the lawsuit they brought against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rasmfeld.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to cope with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by attorney Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., initially involved 17 plaintiffs but rose to 28 in the following months -- 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or threatened with sexual violence by co-workers and that the army has not properly investigated, prosecuted, or secured the assaults.
Burke says she's targeting the top ranks of the army because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the people who can exterminate the cult of violence? Supreme leadership."
Burke also says she has been contacted by about 400 other victims since February, many of whom may be involved in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case – putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak – she will open a lot of cases if needed to maintain pressure.
The Defense Department’s defense team, led by federal prosecutor Neil McBride, took steps to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek reveal a defense strategy—mostly consisting of former or current soldiers not being able to claim damages in the military.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court ruling as the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for damages caused by persons in military service.
"The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the plaintiffs' military service," the documents said.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the story.
Since the 1950s, the situation has changed.
Although women are still officially banned from fighting, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear frontline.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldiers' teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contacts with local women in the war zone.
Between the two wars, 150 women soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for the armies to become modern, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her claim, three others are preparing.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies on charges of encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
Separately, the non-profit association of American veterans of the Vietnam War is preparing a lawsuit against the army, which focuses on diagnoses of “personality changes” that are put on victims of violence to remove them from service, a common occurrence, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the human rights group Women in the Military Action Organization.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Office of Veterans Affairs in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices in reviewing pension applications from people who claim to have been subjected to sexual violence while on duty.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were submitted to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Department of Sexual Abuse Prevention and Control Service, there were 3,158 reported rape attempts.
But the attacks are often not reported, and the Pentagon estimates that this figure is about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases went to court -- half as many as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case call the attacks on them only the first of a number of other injuries.
In the Lyman case, she reported the rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she says, she was asked to give details of the rape separately 11 times to a string of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the assailant's blood -- from a cut on her arm -- was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat in front of a judge at a hearing in which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier in the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive characterization to the defendant, who was ultimately acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was having a baby - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember my commander saying, 'It wasn't a trial for him, it was a trial for me.'"
Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change that made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with an unfavorable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case brought by Lyman and her classmates will move forward is a difficult question, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: “In my opinion, they are in a position to move forward.”
Between them and the verdict stands the doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared.
I've been criticizing the Feres Doctrine all my life.
The army has lagged behind for decades because it lacks the incentives and deterrents it imposes.
He adds: “The odds are largely against them ... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was an ordinary guy laying out his anti-immigration views online.
Breivik, who confessed to the July massacre in Norway that claimed the lives of 77 people, appeared for his first open court hearing on Monday.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was far from being alone online: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack at his computer, chatting with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It’s easy – you just have to go to Facebook.
“We realized that it was not difficult to approach them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European cyber-populism by the British DEMOS Research Centre.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the site’s advertising tool to single out the necessary demographics with scientific accuracy – which marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then pitched them an ad, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ad suggested the user undergo a survey that asked questions about their level of education, attitude to violence, and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without even leaving the office.
“This is a completely new way to conduct research,” says Bartlett.
Some results are not so striking: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young males dissatisfied with immigration.
But unexpectedly, “those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more intelligent, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who just hide behind a monitor.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends, which are expressed in 'Likes', posts on the wall and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three posts a day, Facebook’s “super-update information” is triggering a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the site’s title in the headline by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it makes it possible to study people who cannot be approached on the street with a notebook.
“In the past, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to join the party and they would never accept you,” says Bartlett.
“Facebook excludes all of this – you address them directly.”
Others say that with the help of this site it would be possible to identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk for alcoholism than students who remained silent about it.
Moreno suggests that peers of students, such as their dorm mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who updates drunken status too often.
“You can’t solve the problem without identifying it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
“We have found a way to identify children at risk who would not otherwise have been found.”
Facebook also constantly retrieves all sorts of data about its users.
The site’s data processing team processed statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, midterm turnout in 2010, and the National Happiness Index (mostly using information that only they have access to – cyber-freedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive data collection public for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined norms for conducting offline research, online data is publicly available.
“I don’t think many users even thought about what a researcher might be watching their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a study he conducted in 2006 using public student Facebook pages.
"As far as they could imagine, it was only between them and their friends."
This raises the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that the subject of the study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much information in the profile and on the user's page is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” says Selwyn.
That’s why, despite years of work in technology research, Selwyn thinks the notebook and pen are still the best research tools you can use.
“Nothing can replace going into the real world and communicating with real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social, and much of the social is still happening offline.”
‘Cold and Inhuman’: Anders Behring Breivik to appear in court for first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to orchestrating the double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance fighter” during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway," he said in front of 500 people in the courtroom.
“I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I admit my actions, but I don't admit my guilt."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he “didn’t want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views.”
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought with him a pre-written speech, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to detain Breivik for another 12 weeks, banned him from the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was locked up.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
“I thought he looked cold and inhuman,” one of the survivors told Norwegian news channel NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but I felt a little better after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange idea that he was part of a large “resistance” movement, the judge ruled he was not crazy and said there was no evidence that he had acted with accomplices.
Some may be reassured that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation is feeling right now.
“I would like him to look like a monster, but he’s not,” said a relative of one victim.
“It would be much easier if that were the case.”
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview Showed at the Theatre This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans may consider the biggest discovery in the newly uncovered interview, which was recalled ahead of the previews in major markets this week, is how much that creative mind understood in business processes and in manufacturing technology.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and a hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from “the sickness of thinking that a truly great idea is 90 percent work... [but] a great idea from a great product is separated by a huge amount of skilled labor.”
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the television series Triumph of the Nerds about the advent of the personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By that time, about 10 years had passed since Jobs was kicked out of Apple, and he was already fully working at his new computer company NeXT in anticipation of the mass development of the Internet.
While a small portion of Kringley's interviews were used in the Nerds, he says the original interviews disappeared during transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This footage, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which comes out in Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusually prepared here to lay out his technology philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different moments during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers – 10-15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems annoyed by Kringley’s questions, forcing him to move more quickly to questions or phenomena of greater importance.
In the pre-Pixar, iPod, and iPhone era, Lost Interview has something sinisterly prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It’s one thing to read about Jobs’ posthumous assessments of his work, but there’s something vulnerable and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, an anxious dreamer on the cusp of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven significant findings of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All the time in business, I've been asking, 'Why do you do this?' And the answers you always get are, 'Oh, that's just how it's done.'
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
Here's what I learned.
Jobs continues to detail his efforts to streamline reporting at Apple.
Frustrated by the way expenses were recorded, often starting with “standard expenses” that were taken from the ceiling and then customized with “clarification,” he created an automated structure that ensured they could track business expenses down to the smallest detail.
Jokes about the Pope:
Jobs details the “blue box” he crafted with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device before, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using an automatic phone, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
“We’ve covered the globe half a dozen times and you’ve been yelling at a vending machine phone, and it’s been penetrating a minute later into a neighboring vending machine phone,” Jobs says with a smile.
“We were young and all we learned was that we could make something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us knew a little bit, but we could craft the little thing that could control the big thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple could have ever come without it.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous trick that he and Wozniak practically coped with, calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope to call, struggling to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to an American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was picked up to answer the phone.
On falling in love with technology (and the cold nickname of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to assemble the frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
“It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP's employees visiting the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the very first desktop computer".
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a small monitor with a beam tube, and I fell in love with it.
I often drove to HP as a teenager and swirled around that car and wrote programs for it.
About improvised innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of circuit boards, one buyer asked him to assemble a whole computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think through both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he encountered while developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the fierce arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], and I was fed up, and I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to assemble for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
For companies that are losing energy:
Long before he led Apple’s renaissance, Jobs accurately predicted how many industry leaders would go wrong in their vision and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who eventually come to the management of companies, and the people who make the product are pushed out of the decision-making platform.
The product genius that led to this monopolistic position is being supplanted by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products – the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
It could have been ten times bigger, it could have been Microsoft of the '90s...
They were defeated in victory.
Innovation as a Form of Art:
“A great idea is separated from a great product by a great amount of skillful labor...when you unwind a great idea, it changes and grows.”
You will learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises you need to make – some things you won’t be able to force to make electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head — these concepts — connecting them all together.
Ultimately, it all comes down to taste – it all comes down to trying to express yourself in the best that humans have ever produced, and later – trying to bring that into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We were always ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made the Macintosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best IT professionals in the world.
If it weren’t for information technology, they would be doing amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with opponents of the health care law while the court sees the case.
On a day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether it would listen to President Obama’s revocation of the health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, celebrated a lunch sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the Supreme Court.
The case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss petitions filed.
One case on the agenda was a petition backed by 26 states challenging a sweeping health review passed by Congress last year, a law that brought conservative activists across the nation together.
The judges agreed to consider the trial; in fact, a pivotal debate of 5 1/2 hours is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the health care law should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was deputy attorney general during George W. Bush’s presidency.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Society of Federalists, a long-standing group that has consistently championed conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court meeting on the case.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the health law.
Honorary guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical norms.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they obeyed, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “A judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor, or mentioned in the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia’s apparent closeness to the two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
“This overwhelming violation of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the claims of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the General Case.
“The judges were drinking and having dinner at an official fundraiser with lawyers whose cases are now in court.”
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all statements of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very willing to confuse court cases with factions such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Jeannie, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that it is an ethical question that arises with respect to Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration when the first court objections to the law were filed at the level of the first instance court.
Her critics demanded that Kagan drop the case because she was too involved in the defense of the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan hasn't shown that she's going to do it.
Boeing receives record $18 billion order for aircraft
Emirates is ordering 50 wide-body Boeing 777s and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal is more than $1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the price list for all these 50 aircraft is $ 18 billion.
Equally important is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the rising goldmine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest order in dollar terms for commercial aircraft – 50 two-pass Boeing 777 aircraft.
An incredible order came from the airline Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total price list to $ 26 billion, Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Airshow.
Later on Monday, Boeing said, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel economy and passenger comfort.
The price list for six aircraft will be more than 1 billion dollars.
“It’s really very good for Boeing,” Morningstar analyst Neil Diora said.
"The quality of these specific customers is quite high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but also the rise in fuel prices, which is usually detrimental to airlines, as it is one of the largest items of expenditure, is not so pernicious because the country makes money on high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel the aircraft when prices rise, Diora said.
“They have a natural defense,” he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps prevent the rival Airbus SAS from attempting to encroach on its dominance with its A350 airliner.
Boeing’s victory at the air show came four months after Airbus said it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which rivals the 777-300ER.
He postponed his debut to increase axial load after buyers demanded an increase in payload and range.
The shares of Boeing Co rose by 1.5% to $ 67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico apparently lost the election in Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug dealers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderón's sister appears to have failed to deliver on her bid for governor of Michoacán during a bitter state election, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped prop up the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the post of governor of the Western state is Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
“The interference of organized crime throughout the election process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country,” Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview the day after Sunday’s vote.
“They intimidated our candidates, our election workers... They grabbed ballot boxes, put obstacles... and made people vote” for the IRP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
She is preparing to return, and winning Michoacán is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only slightly overtaken Calderón, who headed the ratings until election day.
Calderón, the candidate of the National Action Party, or HDP, led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, which now holds the governor’s seat, came third – a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital Morelia, denied ties to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence continues to this day.
The mayor of the HDP was killed a week before the election when he campaigned for Luisa María Calderón, and several candidates withdrew from the local election race out of fear.
For the IRP, however, no matter how awful the Michoacán elections may look, the victory will give the party a driving impetus.
The man who should represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging on the eve of next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has pledged India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB’s office in Manila, said the two fastest-growing major economies should “do everything they can” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that BRIC countries look at Europe’s challenges “impartially” and said Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
“It concerns all of us.”
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable.”
“So if China and India can help, it has to be done.”
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing has grown threateningly, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The unfolding debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could once again lead the world economy into recession, and has led to calls for leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian aid would be delivered through the IMF, but he said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU bailout bonds, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided enormous negotiating power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing declining exports and declining foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have huge challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a possible option, it’s a prerequisite because where we find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls.”
Others argue that it makes no sense for emerging economies like India to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Warshni, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be very difficult politically to help Europe for India’s 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
“At some point, they will find out that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and going for holidays to the sea, and that will not be well received,” he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, unprofitable enterprises such as the railways.
Mr. Neg said the eurozone crisis threatens “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
The ADB’s forecast for 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 now faces “lower risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to make “emergency plans” to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon warns of potential cuts to defense spending
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta stoked on Monday in Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting used to the $450 billion cut in the coming decade, but now fears that additional cuts of $600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress fails to come to an agreement on spending.
“The consequences of these cuts will be devastating to the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Republican Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said the Congress’ failure to pass a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration triggered a 23% general cut and the termination of many new projects.
“Such a severe cut, applied so thoughtlessly, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or building – and would cause serious damage to other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote.
“We will also have to forcibly lay off many of our civilian workers, and since the cuts will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to lay off civilians to achieve the goal.”
“These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will cause serious damage to combat readiness.”
The cuts will eventually affect military units, Panetta said.
“While military funding in overseas emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequester, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious breakdown in core budgets,” Panetta warned.
“Contract personnel will be reduced, which will result in the cancellation of contracts and the oversight contract that supports the troops.”
“Staff will be cut, resulting in delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted.”
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of the sequestration of the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We steadfastly oppose these draconian actions,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday evening as they released Panetta’s letter.
“It’s not an option that we can live with, and it’s not an option that we have to impose on ourselves.”
“Sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and that cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter or the senators’ latest warnings will lead to a budget compromise or intensify calls for the Pentagon to be freed from cuts will be seen later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about the possible cuts, although he came to work in the Pentagon leadership after years of budgetary expertise in Congress and the White House, and realizing that he was facing a tough choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a bleak picture of what might follow -- troops with a shell but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a squad with no bullets."
"This is the wing of an airplane without sufficiently trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission,” Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from an unstable fighting spirit, poor readiness and is unable to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta voiced new details of how the cuts “engender significant operational risks: slowing down the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limiting our ability to be first in deployment and response everywhere in the world; and leading to unacceptable risks in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face obstacles, including those that have already passed the tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 strike fighter, a planned new bomber, a next-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship, and a new ground fighting vehicle that the Army and Marines need to replace the hummer.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it is a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to catch a lie
A quick look at the latest headlines shows how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Kane is busy challenging allegations of sexual harassment from several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania administration was charged with perjury because they allegedly concealed that a retired football coach had raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner has made a fool of himself by denying his tricks, which were quickly refuted by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with financial fraud during a campaign to cover up extramarital affairs.
And again, no one living at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton accused of lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of fraud in school and college exams are commonplace.
There were times when teachers gave students answers to tests in order to have a good assessment of their performance.
Mentors who are supposed to teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In one day, research shows you can be lied to 10 to 200 times.
Now it is assumed that a significant part of this is a lie for salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of dating each other.
Detecting lies or incriminating them is a necessary skill for everyone, both for personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game like, say, charades, where you have to exclaim “Caught!”, the detection of lies is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been debunked.
Liars look into your eyes.
They do not always stutter, stutter, blush, or fuss.
It is not necessary to conclude from this that liars are difficult to notice and difficult to expose.
An experienced whistleblower can get to the truth by observing the structure of allegations, facial expressions, question structure, and time characteristics.
I’ve spent several years researching scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of lying knowledge, and it’s clear that lying detection is a modern skill that’s easy to learn and that helps navigate in our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, negotiating, or managing.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie more about others, usually to protect someone’s feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried ones (but the lies they tell are most often brazen).
We also know that if you are perceived as a deceiver, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called "definition of the initial state."
This helps to provide a starting point for evaluating changes further.
Observe the posture, laughter, voice characteristics of your object.
It is good for you to know if a person is constantly tapping with his feet in a normal state, then you will not make unjust accusations when you see a tapping with his feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Deceivers can fix their upper body when trying to remember their story, they can put their feet towards the door, lean towards the exit, change their posture in a certain way, or demonstrate “relief after an interview” – that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture when all the difficult issues are behind.
Investigators often falsify the signal to end the interrogation just to see that relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to the speech of your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson stumbled and used the past time, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her searches throughout the country.
Vaccinating people can also use distancing in speech: “I didn’t have a sexual relationship with this woman ... Miss Lewinsky” or repeat the complex question altogether.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely noticeable.
Someone can use the “qualifying language” when answering the complex question: “Well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... as far as I know.”
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to detect a lie, but it is possible to master the skill of detecting deception.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone not to become a victim of skilled crooks in professional and personal life.
Controversial plan to build oil pipeline needs revision after US threat to delay approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- sparking anger from trade unions but calming environmentalists -- a company planning to build the pipeline says it will willingly reconsider the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada said on Monday evening it would remove the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Sand Hills area in Nebraska and is confident the project will still get approval.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada spokesman Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for the pipeline, albeit with a different route.
This follows the State Department’s announcement last week that it would postpone a decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills area and the Ogalala Aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
“This is a real step forward,” said Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
A new environmental review commissioned by the State Department is likely to delay the decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, although authorities have denied that politics was involved in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama called the decision a call from the State Department, and expressed support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline is expected to stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It is supposed to transport 700,000 barrels per day from Alberta to oil refineries in Texas.
To do this, he has to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by trade unions, who hope for some 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposing the plan are considering a bill to expedite relocation from the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current study on environmental impacts showed that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but an energy industry source said the Department’s auditor had ordered a separate review of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada’s hired lobbyist, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other was whether the choice of the firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was inappropriate as it was related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to feel sick from fear
A family in New York claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle began to rage in the lobby of their Manhattan home, terrifying their young daughter to the point that she vomited out of fear.
Lady Marmalade's tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so badly that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "a strong fear of strangers," her family told the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It happened on November 10 last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to embark on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and lowered her daughter to the floor for a minute.
"Someone came to me from behind and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
Labelle angrily reprimanded the pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, 'You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door,'" Monk said.
“I told her, ‘I don’t care what you say or think.’
She became furious and began to use curses -- the word in C and the word in F -- in elevated tones ...
She had a bottle of water and she started pouring water out of the bottle at me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
“I told this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” the mother said.
LaBelle attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her companions had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanne Monk.
The baby cried so much that she was sick, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle a note demanding an apology, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives do not respond to calls for comment.
The amount of compensation for the harm done is not disclosed, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money he receives to charity for children with cancer.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her actions,” Davis said.
“Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially in relation to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms.”
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López's reign in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labor market increased, foreign funding declined, and the economy was weakened.
2011 is a year that will go down in the economic history of Sinaloa as related to the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés, also called the year of change, which gave rise to high hopes for economic development, but given the unfavorable climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, however, a decline in the main indicators of economic development was recorded.
The low temperatures of February not only led to millions of losses for the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth opportunities of the state economy, causing a decline in economic activity overall by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly due to a historical decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on frost-affected areas provided by the Council for Sustainable Rural Development of Mexico, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were completely affected and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected. The main crops damaged were vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state with more than half of the population, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters there was an accelerated increase in the unemployment rate, from January to March 55,053 people were unemployed, with a share of 4.53% of the economically active population, in the second quarter of July 18.
Reduced liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is plagued by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions that have been taken in public policy.
“What we’re seeing now is an increase in unemployment, which is due to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market to limit the resources imposed by a law passed in Congress to fight money laundering, as people who illegally own dollars are not easy to work with, invest in and use in something,” he said.
Stopped Immigration
López Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad was limited in the United States, primarily because of difficulties with entry, and in the second - because once they enter, they already face many difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people stay and demand jobs here in the state, as a result, the unemployment rate is growing,” he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of Sinaloa’s labor market becomes worse if you pay attention to the large number of violations that prevail in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the state’s active population works without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregularities in design, another reminder of work in the state is represented by low wages; the state has the lowest wages in the country, according to records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was up to September 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, which is 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to a decline in economic activity and a high unemployment rate, 2011 saw the largest outflow of foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, according to the Treasury Department, the state’s FDI was $630.697 from January to July, showing a drop of 87.74 percent compared to $5,143,312 over the same period last year.
For its part, the State Department of Economic Development recorded a total of 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, mostly in service companies.
Debt
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, the state government requested in July during the state congress approval of a 3 billion peso loan that would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of government capabilities.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011 there was a lack of agreement on the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
“The economic performance in Sinaloa this year was really low, we have to work hard to recover the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have not been able to coordinate the efforts of everyone and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic slowdown
López Loredo said events such as early frosts this year halted the state’s economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
"The low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not getting fast enough to create economic dynamics that allows us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations," he said.
Revision of direction
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, said the state needs to continue its most dynamic production activity.
“In general, we found that we were working on this, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Upcoming work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction in order to better guide the government’s efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government is trying to be successful in various areas, in terms of economic development there is little progress, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has demonstrated progress in its own manner of conducting public policy.
“There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware that there is a lot more to be done,” he said.
He was sentenced for 8 kilograms of marijuana
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days’ income – a sentence that was handed down to a citizen of Navolato for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General’s Office reported that the convicted drug trafficker was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of a crime against health, in this case marijuana possession for distribution.
According to case AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 while patrolling Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck, in which he was carrying a black bag in a drawer in the car, and in the passenger seat there was a small backpack, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continues to be imprisoned at the Crime Legal Consequences Support Centre.
You need to make contributions to the work
Public works related to programs such as Homeland, Saving Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk remaining unfinished or postponed for a long time due to lack of funds, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that although the work programmes have so far evolved, they are in danger, as the state government is unable to make appropriate contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which the staff had to contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, they did not give us a penny when they were supposed to give us a part from the beginning of July," he said, "so as not to delay, we started the work and they made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions that he had to make, so at the beginning of the term the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than $7 million, an amount that was not provided in that case by the state administration.
“It happened to us in the previous administration because the state didn’t have the financial capacity to participate, and the programs continued to evolve, and this year, to access these programs, we need to find resources to cover what the state owes,” he explained.
Although the state had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to increase efforts so that interest related to them would arrive as quickly as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny."
The court will approve the “transition to digital television” in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court has rejected constitutional claims put forward by the Senate and House of Representatives against a presidential decree that postpones the so-called “digital television transition” from 2021 to 2015 because the eight votes needed to overturn it were not obtained.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers, issuing a decree detailing the actions to move to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes necessary for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television program is a right enshrined by law in the Federal Telecommunication Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvador, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the demand of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the prime minister said he disagreed with the draft arguments in the sense that the federal executive cannot determine by general rules the measures for which the state administration should prepare.
"I also do not believe that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of state policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the management of the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals – one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years – has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Delaying the transition, he said, would mean deferring the benefits of digital transformation, which involves meeting societal needs that have more than just a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These issues, he said, "require the work of the entire system, formed on the principle of state economic management, includes a group of authorities, which the Constitution unites into the state executive power."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and did so with the help of the executive branch, despite the presence of highly specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be inferred from this that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws passed by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoacán analyzes the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data transmitted to the PPRV, the difference between first and second place in the governorial elections is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes, accounting for 879 of the total number of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of counting “vote by vote” is real with regard to this year’s election process in Michoacán, where, according to data obtained from the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor’s elections is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes, which account for 879 of the total of 6,074 protocols.
In light of this, the Chairman of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (MII), Maria de Los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the Electoral Corps approved a set of principles to align local rules with federal electoral reform.
As it should be recalled, Michoacán did not pass the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the deadlines set forth in the law.
On the same day, November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (SJJ) ruled on the constitutional claim put forward by the local legislature and called the vote of the state's constitutional reform representative "invalid and illegal", as he did not have the right to "allow or support them".
In an interview about the possibility of a “vote for a vote”, María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council, it would be possible to submit a partial or full vote count by a local electoral body.
Thus, a partial recalculation of one or more ballot boxes may be made under the condition that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no protocol for voting and counting documents in the ballot box or it is not in the possession of the chairman; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the minutes.
In addition, a general recount of votes in all ballot boxes may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the supposed candidate-winner of the elections under consideration and those who received the second place in the voting is less than or equal to one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from a representative of the party and/or coalition that put forward the second of the mentioned candidates.
A general recount of votes shall also be made if, at the end of the ordinary recount, it is established that the difference between the winner and the second-placed candidate is less than or equal to one percent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate has taken second place, in the event that the ballot boxes that were taken into account in the partial recount are excluded.
It is worth noting that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PPRV, the difference between first and second places is only 0.16 percent, not even counting 129 votes out of the total number of 923 protocols.
His last will.
His ashes will be scattered in the Sapaliname Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortez arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday evening; an examination and a funeral service were held on Monday.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last will was to have his ashes scattered in the Sapaliname mountains.
After accepting condolences along with other people who died in the crash, the family of Basio Cortez returned to the capital Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he underwent a tour of the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member while in high school.
“His wish was to return to Saltillo, and to have his ashes scattered in the mountains of Sapaliname, he always told his family and friends,” said Sandra Cortés Basio, the pilot’s sister.
In her opinion, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother, devoted to his family".
Felipe Cortez Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the College of Aviation in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some did not believe him, they said that he was dizzy even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Marta Saagun to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Zapopan for a diploma ceremony of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying a plane.
He is escorted on his last journey.
Gunshots were fired in honor of Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortes Basio, headed by Governor Jorge Torres López, people from the village and government of the state, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth War Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, and by the leaders and students of the Technological High School at Saltillo, 1985.
Basio Cortez was killed recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, along with the provincial government secretary, Jose Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of that ministry.
At 18:05, the remains of Basio Cortez (cremated), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force led by Major James Martínez, on the esplanade of a training school, where his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, students, her mother, brothers and other relatives, were already waiting for him.
Three bodies found abandoned at NL Caderaita farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Caderaita Jimenez, Nuevo León.
The find was found on the 1.5-kilometer highway of Caderaita in the direction of Santiago, on a hill in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people passing by noticed that in a village house, the wall of which is painted beige and brown, the gate was open.
Looking inside, literally three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow T-shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white T-shirt.
Almost in one meter was the body of another person, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three lay face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no shell casings on the site.
On the fence of a village house there are signs addressed by one organized criminal group to another, also in it and in the gate there are several bullet holes.
11 caught in a quadriplegic
The Department of Homeland Security presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Caderaita municipality and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, “fraud” and secret burials.
According to published information, initially on November 11 in the colony of Los Alvero, eight people were detained, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three homes and a phone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another event occurred on November 12 at 06:00 a.m., military personnel were making a patrol tour of the village of Old Rancho in Kaderite when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the cabin.
After stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 cartridges.
Later, after these statements, on November 13, at 14:00, one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Pravda, who, seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Terran, Hina and Kadereita.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italy's appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take its positions.
Monty said he would present the president with the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country’s ability to emerge from this difficult period,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not say directly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that obstacles were overcome.
“The structure is now well outlined,” he said.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less than usual, as Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
At the heart of the pressure on Monti to hurry, volatile markets set Italy’s BTP bond yield at more than 7% for 10 years, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to bail out.
Emma Marchegalia, leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after meeting Monti: “We said we would actively support this government.”
We believe that this government is Italy’s last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monti's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP's Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts should lead to a good outcome,” Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the technocratic government majority that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government should have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has stepped up pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations.
He will finish his series of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief pause at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the value of Italy’s debt has now reached a critical level amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will be successful.
Rescuing Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern eurozone financial defenders.
Monti said his government would exist until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite widespread forecasts that politicians would only give him time to carry out reforms before calling new elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist it should be composed only of technical specialists, a testament to their dissatisfaction with the fact that the process is affected by the financial situation.
Political sources said the parties’ mutual mistrust and disagreement complicate the attempt to include political figures.
Spaniards have more gaming experience than Ticos
Of the 22 players announced in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 matches.
A slight contrast to Costa Rica when compared to the 22 players challenged by both countries for a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the San Jose National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, have a whole list of qualifying games of Class A, Tricolor has only defender Michael Uman as the only one to have held 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2), at the stadium named after Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players, who play in the All-Star League and in the strong clubs of the Premier League of England, have been very active in the league and in local cup competitions this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the Champions League.
To this, it is worth adding the experience of the Spanish Furia in a difficult qualification in the Euro or the World Championship.
Tikos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see the top of the list in the Spanish national team goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Subizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernández, a Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Javi were named the best last week by UEFA together with another player of the Iberian team, Subizarreta, with 126 matches and scorer Schalke Raúl González with 102.
Almost close to a hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Javi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side, next to Michael Umana, left side Junior Díaz with 48 matches and scorer Brian Ruiz with 45.
Further, only five have crossed the line in 30 games: Keylor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain with Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiola (31).
The squad with less than 30 appearances has Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The others didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet made their debut.
Spain's lead player David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who brought in more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernández and three times as much as Roy Murray and Parks.
The quintet included the country in the tour in honor of the twentieth anniversary of his career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the band is ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It’s been over 20 years of waiting, but the band says it’s also a dream come true for them to play in this country.
This was a statement by bassist and founder Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is in South America as part of a 20-year tour and will make its only stop in Central America on Sunday, 20th.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Los Angeles team The X and the local group Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from a conversation, the full transcript of which is available online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once – on vacation, it’s a beautiful country and I think we can stay there for a few days.
We are very happy to bring our music here.
I ask this because there is some commitment to the band; the fans live in tension in the days before the concert.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat it like the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played in the last 21 years have taken place over the past two weeks.
We’ve had some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope it put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you learn about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua as well as Mexico, these are great places to surf, that’s how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say that you made a grand show with a lot of songs.
What do you plan to do in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there before, there’s no limit to what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible with a wide variety of songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a great variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How do you do that?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven’t played in a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
This tour marks 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe what you’ve done?
Yes, absolutely.
First, I think none of us could ever have imagined that we would be in a rock band and the fact that we have been doing this for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We are delighted with our success and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love making music.
We are happy to go to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
Everything is going very well for us.
What does it mean to you to be a significant part of the flowering of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We are good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s great when a movement grows out of a group of friends, and that’s unusual.
From time to time, one group from one city appears, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle band.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we are happy to be friends with all of them and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle sound that came out.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same composition for so long.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many bands exist.
First, I think we’re lucky to still be alive, and second, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, musical paths have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other’s music and it couldn’t have been better.
Your attitude towards the word glory was not easy; but thanks to your success you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We take care not to be on tour for too long because it’s easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for the music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what made it, not deciding to be famous and to be a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we write really good songs and it was great in the beginning.
We were a band for almost three years and didn’t release a single album until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of disappointment because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still close friends with Bruce (Fervezer) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a photo, I think about the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh a lot and about football, it was always a pleasure to go to work.
He was a wonderful man and we miss him.
Local band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you’re familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose her to discover?
Yes, the producers sent us a few video offers and it was the band we liked the most, so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas has to offer live and it should be very exciting.
Why do you constantly change the words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he uses the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwhistle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping grunge relevant, even though it is no longer in vogue?
I think we all feel a certain detachment from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of bands I’ve mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came out at the same time, and if it matters now, I think it’s wonderful because it’s music that’s worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are making music better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, but now it’s more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a few songs on the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very gloomy, although they may sound a little bit positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are very gloomy.
I think as you grow up and there’s been some kind of trauma in your life and you’ve lost a family member or a friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs of course reflect that for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at a state hospital for examination for muscle loss seen in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, which has left him under observation and surgery four times.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told television channel N that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that in his opinion Fujimori should be a candidate for the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He underwent four operations on tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, to which were added other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with blood circulation in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Special Operations Police Department.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by a squadron of extermination of the army, which operated secretly during the first years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguay’s President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will arrive in Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and begin negotiations on the region’s political issues.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the most important point of an extensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be “favourable for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations”, as the South American country’s leadership published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderon’s support for Uruguay in an incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in the list of tax havens at a G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that sparked Uruguay’s protest and recall for consultations of his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group formed from the most developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, had a tax information exchange agreement with the South American country since January this year to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has tried in recent years to expedite the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in order to leave this “gray list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, compiled from countries that do not use international standards of tax cooperation.
As for the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The mustache plumber will be 3D with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser’s evil paws, but never before has he done it in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The edition, which will appear in stores around the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the portable console Nintendo 3DS, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
“Mario is a hero who has to tell you how stereoscopy will work without glasses,” said Omar Alvarez, Nintendo’s Spanish head of press, during the game’s presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said Super Mario 3D Land was "the first Nintendo video game specifically developed for this platform" because hitherto successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adaptations of existing games.
A Nintendo spokesperson said that despite its existence in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and agile gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go "for the second round" to the levels of the game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that affects only the depth of action, but which needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome a variety of obstacles and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, a plumber with a mustache has to walk on dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new movements, scenery, costumes and enemies, as well as "playing" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process for Alfonso Portillo had begun to hold him accountable in the United States for a $70 million laundering plot.
Thus ends the process in which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which demanded the extradition of Portillo to be tried there.
At a press conference, Kolom said his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure he did not “lay hands” on legal decisions and had undertaken all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
Together with Portillo Sergio Ruano, Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Kolom did shows the enforcement process after all legal and constitutional courts were exhausted to prosecute the former head of state from 2000 to 2004.
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court, Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzlement of Q120 million in the Department of Defense during the presidential term, a process preceding extradition, but the Department of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove’s social support organization are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social exclusion have helped overcome difficult situations during this quarter of a century.
It is worth adding to this more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the reason for the results of the ceremony, held in the premises of the old factory Fabra I Coats, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove was born near Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or subject to marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association over these 25 years.
Various political representations during the election showed the unified nature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the chairman of the Generality, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the ceremony was attended by the former Socialist Education consultant, Ernest Maraghal, and the former mayor’s lieutenant and current eco-socialist, member of the municipal council, Ricardo Goma.
Fabra I Coats also featured the current Social Welfare and Family Advisor, Josep Lewis Claris, and La Caixa Social Work CEO, Haume Lanaspa.
He said Trinijove was born at a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base."
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of fighting bad circumstances and inspiring hope in people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not new for the organization and the work done to it,” he said.
Captured building, where mass parties were organized, evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51.
12 occupants left the building yesterday at noon without a fight
It seems that the nightmare experienced by neighbors living in the house 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they illegally occupied yesterday at noon, where they organized mass parties that annoyed neighbors, by court order without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, there will be a checkpoint here," the manager said.
Squatters, who seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest were inhabited, appropriated all electricity and some water, painted the walls and left marks of various kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a venue for mass parties that lasted up to two days and annoyed the owners.
Right behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club says that the intruders of the building dragged her into an unfair competition, as they sold drinks for three euros, while in the club for 10.
In addition, the owner of the disco had to respond to the neighbors' complaints about the noise, although, as she noticed, the noise was caused not by the visitors of the club, but by the residents of the squat and, above all, by those who attended the parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The owner of the club said the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and now for nine months, he "forgives" her the payment of the rent.
The city police also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, Alberto Fernand Díaz, demanded last week that the building be evacuated “immediately to address the problems of coexistence and common spirit that have arisen among neighbors and the degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that until the summer, only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months squatters have invaded all floors and virtually every room, and that some of them have been hacked.
In this sense, he added, “Impunity must end and culturelessness in the building must be steadfastly resisted.”
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building to Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police drove to 35 rue de Montrall after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
A park or a forest?
Architects agree on the possibility of a competition after disputes about contributions
16-door municipal contest renews debate on Collserola’s role in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now extinct Capital Corporation of Barcelona (SCB), this administration printed promotional leaflets for Collserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park of the capital of Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with Central Park of New York.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987 the park again took its place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that are oriented not north-south, but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The positioning of Collserola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar in the role of Yoga Bear.
This was so until, in September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 competitions for a multitude of other gates in Collserola.
Under the gate is understood the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that, or someone wants to put a gate on the field.
The question is one: Collserola? Park or mountain?
Competitions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a topic of discussion for all architects in Barcelona.
This is perhaps the most recurring topic discussed when two members of this clan of chosen people recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact leads precisely to one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona say and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: competition is appropriate
For Roldán, after reaching the coastline, it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front side of the mountain" when Ildefone Serda's proposal, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
“The biggest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, thanks to its excellent accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the headline "Colserola's gate" contains a "verbal trap": we should not think of them "as an entrance to the park, but as a restriction of some areas where we must act."
Modolo, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in urban construction, called the proposal an “intellectual task” with “some dangers”.
Risks arising from the “uncertainty of forecasting public space” after the experience of the 1980s, which ended on the Forum site “with its swan song”.
The first fear is actually limiting the boundaries where you can build.
“Limiting something is preparing the next step,” I mean, the transition.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools because the current [regarding the Capital Master Plan (GSP)] can lead to real disaster.”
Closer to the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Collserola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, and not" as a purely topographical issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside of Calcerola that "should not be missed", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the city hall offers his profession to join this project "from the very beginning".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is what should guide the interdisciplinary teams ("success", he argues), which were supposed to create: "Architects should only be a tool".
Bayona hints that the answer to the question, which asks the title of this part, is complex, as the rules of the competition lack the general appearance of Collserola: "16 overlapping competitions were announced," he says, "in the sense of sea-mountain, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
At least in his case, he decided to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the design for one gate can intersect the program and definition with the architect's design for the neighboring gate.
From your point of view, the council should ensure that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrazabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlements, a Red Casino court representative pardoned Monterrey’s brother in a lawsuit against him on extortion charges.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazabal will be free after the legal representative of Red Casino granted him forgiveness before the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting extortion proceedings against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garcia posted a series of photos and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic fee so that the Monterrey authorities would allow a secret operation in the gambling house.
After public condemnation, the Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Department of Inheritance Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He remained there for 49 days, following the instructions of the second order banning the movement after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereita allegedly for extorting half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours there in a prison with a moderate degree of isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
Authorities allowed him to continue serving time at the San Nicolas Municipal Prison in Garza.
On October 25, the arrest order was issued by the Second Criminal District Court’s secretary, Jorge Janes, who said that after almost two months of investigations, the evidence of Jonas’ guilt was quite obvious, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from representatives of bookmakers in exchange for permission for the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask for pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that in the next hours he could get his freedom.
During the trial, the state prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether he had compensated for the damage and which of the gambling house’s partners was granting a pardon, although the lawyer tried not to say his name.
Based on record 197/2011, Jonas Larrazabal has been granted a legal pardon, and thereafter no statements can be made about the trial that was planned against him; nor will any compensation or punishment be required.
After a hearing of the bookmaker’s legal representative, almost at 15:50, it was ordered to release Larrazabal Breton immediately.
Court clerk Jorge Janez went to the prison of San Nicolás Municipality in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionisio Pérez Hacome details the crash that killed Interior Minister Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) said the results obtained in the accident, in which Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed, showed that the helicopter hit the ground directly in a state of complete integrity, without the pilot attempting to make an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Hacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found out that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
“Items that appear to indicate that the vessel had multiple contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 meters, where the vehicle lost its fuselage.”
He also reported that the ship was intended for 19 people, respectively, it met the necessary requirements for the carriage of people.
He also said studies conducted in the strike area did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
"The study reports that there are no components of the vessel elsewhere, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
“The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for the transportation of passengers.
The earth in this place has a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
So far, the secretary said, the main thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study could take months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto López Meyer, CEO of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said the presidential helicopter was operating at cruising speed at the time of the strike and that it happened on soft rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal flight maneuver at the moment of impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Hacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the rules of aviation, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports identified suitable conditions for takeoff when the aircraft headed for the border area between the city of Mexico City and the state of Mexico, where layers of clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that due to cloud conditions, the team was looking for a zone of lower altitude and greater visibility in the Cuernavaca Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording from the aircraft radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change of direction.
The scattering of debris in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact fell on the front and side lines.
The scattered debris indicates that the helicopter collided with the ground in structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
In the disaster zone, there is undiscovered evidence in the wreckage of a ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies show that there may have been multiple contacts with the ground.
During work on the site were found pieces of the aircraft at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After careful study of a larger area than the demarcated area near the site of the crash, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Obesity Gene Search Program
Social Protection Leads Study on Obesity Gene Search in Children and Young Adults; Supported by IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young adults, dubbed the "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence" protocol, which will provide counting of signs associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the 21st Century National Medical Center, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been assembled.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students of the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (prescribed or not) is invited to participate by going to the MSSI sports centers participating in the study, in the Valley of Mexico City, where tests involving children will be conducted every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began to be conducted at the sports center in Cuauhtémoc (west of Mexico State), and from October 8, the events are held at the sports center in Nezahualcoyotl (east of Mexico State).
Once the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children is reached, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (South Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (North Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of this study is to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 years with parental permission and under their supervision to fill out individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and a history of family inherited diseases to avoid the risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist circumference), measurements of blood pressure and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity) will be carried out on Saturday.
Cruz López said the study reflects health professionals’ concerns about the alarming weight gain among children.
In medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006, there was an increase in just 6 years: in the case of boys, 77 percent were obese, in the case of girls, 47%; in the case of overweight, there was also a significant increase," said the MSSI specialist.
He said the validity of the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from other peoples in their genetic history.
He reported that, on average, a Mexican is 65 percent descendant of American Indians, 30 percent descendant of Europeans, and five percent descendant of Africans, and this condition is reflected in genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, basically, the consequence of the genetics of obesity is the body’s inability to burn excess energy that we consume (calories), and it is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the immediate benefit for participants is a comprehensive assessment of children, which can reveal whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, having dark folds on the neck (acants) and forearms means the likelihood of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is treated with complete confidentiality, doctors pass it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and lifestyle changes that must be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main causes of overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the TV, and using transport for short distances instead of walking.
This is also due to the high calorie intake, that is, the increase in the consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic predisposition analyzed in this program.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Department of Chemistry, has developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality, resistant to environmental and temperature influences.
If the signals sent by the road surface were paid attention, then it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand pits for each rainy season in the metropolitan area in the Valley of Mexico, says Rafael Herrera Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM Department of Chemistry, and adds that if the process of construction and maintenance of the paved road surface is correct.
In his lecture A Technological View of Pits, given as part of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nachera said that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and therefore counteract the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight called maltenes, which together give the road surface its characteristic viscous-elastic behavior.
The viscous behavior of bitumen lies in the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not constant, but varies throughout the day, depending on natural conditions and temperatures, said a specialist in chemical engineering.
The chemist noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexible coating, which is composed of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the topmost layers is bitumen, composed of small stones lowered into bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is submerged in bitumen.
When moving vehicles and exerting effort, it helps the forces to distribute very well on the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be distributed even better, a chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt, he added, placed the last layer, which is called the wear layer, which is made of fine stone, actually sand also submerged in the asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact the transport wheels, it should have more resistance than asphalt and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute these efforts, the wear layer also requires proper thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the condition of the asphalt.
When the earth is wet, water enters the coating and it is difficult for it to get out of it, this causes all layers of the coating to soften and, consequently, the formation of pits.
When the pits are formed, he said, the first wear layer is worn and only then it affects the bitumen, but the damage does not occur instantly, this is a process that should be paid attention to at the first signs of ongoing repair programs.
Also, a member of the National System of Research explained that the transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each coating layer should always be associated with the transport load and it is necessary to ensure that this requirement is met in order to prevent the frequent occurrence of pits.
Rafael Herrera said that there is still a lot to learn about bitumen and make, for example, bitumen emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even help to fix pits with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing from the Vallée candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serna Melina Ramirez from getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Valle received the title of princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca only wanted to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Cerna had to be content to get on the podium with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her the new princess of Colombia.
Taking into account the result achieved last night by Alce Alcea Alcea Alcea in Cartagena, Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea Alcea
The question that many are asking now:
What was missing? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in each of the performances demonstrated that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not for nothing she was elected Queen of Police and the Most Beautiful Face by Vogue - titles held by Queens, for example, Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the crown
The first factor that played a role in the jury’s decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to convincingly answer the question “Which book characterizes you and why?” asked by Martin Murillo Gómez of the Let’s Read Society.
She replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it’s a form of cultivation, and I definitely think that the book that characterizes my childhood – The Little Prince – is a rather deep book.
Today I am reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all be reading; also at the moment I am reading a book by Irina Nemirovsky, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called The Heat of Blood.
The answer, which the jury did not like because of the term “cultivation” and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the cited books characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and satisfied with her result: "The universe is wise, what is going to happen is what is going to happen."
And you all, please read a little, 'The Little Prince' is a great book."
Among the hypotheses voiced – Valle burned out of favoritism.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that because she was preferred, she was greeted with a standing ovation, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (the Osters culinary contest, the audience vote for the best national costume, and the Queen Mother), "which aroused the jealousy of other candidates, provoked the queen's stress, and as a consequence, she would not.
And this was noted during her first appearance in a swimsuit at Hilton Beach and during her two screenings at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy that representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for RCN’s “As At Home” program, said the fact that Milena was named a princess “means that the candidate who wins more awards during the contest does not become queen.”
In addition, the representative of Valle recently avoided communication with the press and it was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle's representative failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Dottie said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for Miss Colombia, we have to look not only at appearances, but also focus on public consciousness, before they take part in the contest, they should already be involved in the projects," she said.
There is also a suggestion that the representative of Valle sinned defects on the buttocks and fibrosis, which was visible on her abdomen, but this is controversial, as the jury specifically noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Hernán Orosco, a consultant to Queens, notes that Melina didn’t have the best body she’s ever had, “but the problems of fibrosis on her abdomen, which weren’t very noticeable to me, made her lose her glasses on her last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the error of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she underwent surgery.
“Operations are good, but the representative of Valle does not know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, the cruel prediction came true last night, it is said that it was a woodpecker that Raimundo gave to Melina as compensation for her loss of the pleasure of getting the crown.
Whether or not this is the case, the fact is that today Melina begins a year of reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions indicated directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the competition in Cartagena, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of the man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A forensic scientist from Cali made history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI forensic scientist Kali went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the head of the FARC, Alfonso Cano, by matching his fingerprints.
Of the seven forensics working at CTI, this week it was Elizar González, a man from Puerto Tejad, who spent 21 years in the field of forensic investigation, who was on duty.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the cities of Chocó, where he often had to hike for more than five days through the jungle to reach the place where there were bodies that needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and after completing the relevant courses, he became a specialist in forensics, where he studied skin friction, i.e. palms and stings.
During the week of Elizar’s operation to identify the man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was approaching.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Cauca to Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses, and one of them was supposed to have belonged to the man who led the world’s oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten snapshots of Guillermo Leon Saenz’s fingerprints (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the location where the body was located, he did not identify it by its appearance; it was very different from the one shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and significantly thinner.
But prints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, a spatula and a flashlight, Elizar matched the fingerprints of the corpse to those in the pictures.
His eyes did not fail: it was Alfonso Cano.
The same night, a Puerto Tejada representative was asked to confirm to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that he was the head of the FARC.
Search for fingerprints
For the fingerprint specialist of the Sijin unit in Cali, the recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar González at a press conference about the operation against Kano is particularly significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Fingerprinting is a rigorous science, without errors, it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprint specialists are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and establish the identity of the detainees.
During detention, many criminals have fake IDs or do not have documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that in the case of the theft, he had to take a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief leaned his hands to seize a safe full of jewelry and money.
“Walls are hard to work with because they are not comfortable surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a full palm snapshot and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts,” he said.
Fingerprints also help to rule out or establish the involvement of suspects in murder-related cases.
Recently, a dead man was found with liquor bottles around him.
During the investigation it was established that a relative could be suspected of committing the crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A fingerprint specialist from the CTI explained that chemical or physical reagent is applied to places where there are fingerprints.
When they appear, a spatula or tape is used to remove them.
After that, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered into the registry.
“The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the TV program about CSI.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves a print on it.
However, where possible, a comparison is made.
Angry People Challenge New York City Authorities
Hundreds of protesters camped in front of Zuccotti Square.
Some of the protesters heard the court's decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the park next door.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday when they attempted to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to seize another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters rallied near Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get, thanks to a court order that allowed "angry people" to camp in the square, while the rest of the movement responded to the dispersal, capturing a park in the north of the city where further arrests were made.
“Our idea is that since the court won’t allow us to camp in the square, we will camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle for a return to Zuccotti and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations,” said Occupy Wall Street spokesman Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of “angry people” to the evacuation of the tent town, which was ordered personally by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, came to the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, “angry people” began to seize the new park, located at the confluence of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the property of the parish of the Church of the Trinity.
For at least an hour they could occupy the post, but then police arrived and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not give an exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The organization claims that several hundred people stood with tents in the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support for members of the movement, trying to act as a mediator in negotiations with the police.
Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday to review the legality of this morning’s dispersal of protesters.
Some of the protesters on their way there carried and distributed copies of the court order at the same time and even gave these copies to the police guarding the square, which led to "some small clashes," Bray said, who said some police officers beat the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of the Occupy Wall Street movement and enforcing “laws that were issued after the start of the seizure, or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with shops and other previously used property.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that the city had suspended the opening of public space because of the court order and the demonstrators were informed about it, but local laws prevented them from rolling out tent stores and sleeping bags again.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zuccotti Square, carried out at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made, and the decision was made because the protesters "broke the law".
Bloomberg said he ordered the square to be cleared as it became “a place where people came not to protest but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people” as “some businesses were threatened” and neighbors feared “for the deterioration of the quality of life.”
The evacuation carried out this morning was disgusting and shows that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” a spokesman for the movement added, condemning the mayor for “disrespect for freedom of speech.”
The Occupy Wall Street leaders also said they intend to organize "grand rallies" on Thursday, working with NGOs and trade unions to commemorate the last two months of protests that began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on Russell Peters' Christmas TV program on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Big Repair", a rescuer in "Rescuers of Malibu", Bunny in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private CTV today announced that Anderson, along with ballad performer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on Russell Peters' Christmas on December 1st as a very special Maria.
CTV today unveiled footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for a widely circulated online home porn video, appears alongside her then-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, appearing dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll depicting Jesus in a crib.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently performed as Charlie Sheen’s “My Cruel Torpedo of Truth” tour host, appears in the role of Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a special Christmas show CTV features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married in Buenos Aires with Argentine model Louisiana Lopilato and who also knows a lot about scandals.
Recently, Bublé called "bitch" American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York
Japan, reborn after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and put an end to the downturn that began in March
Japan’s economy has been paralyzed since March last year and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that triggered the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster suffered by the Land of the Rising Sun since World War II.
According to initial estimates by the Tokyo government, the material losses amounted to $300,000 million – a blow that, despite the difficult world situation, seems to be passing.
After three consecutive quarters of loss, data on gross domestic product from July to September definitely helped to turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% year-on-year.
Registered in the second quarter – for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 – also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The revival can be explained in part by the revival of the purchase of machinery to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, the companies increased their investment by 1.1% against a 0.9% drop in capital expenditure from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true turnaround in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for using the crisis to strengthen – or rebuild – infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan woke up, mainly due to the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This figure increased by 1% under the influence of increased costs for cars, travel and recreation.
Yen stigma
Tokyo granted the domestic market when the yen — the Japanese currency — became one of the “refuge currencies” chosen by investors seeking to get rid of the eurozone debt crisis and negative outlooks on the US, a privilege that squeezes like a rock into the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic exchange rate is determined by the health of large tech companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for its low performance from July to September.
As long as markets continue to besiege the EU’s peripheral countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda has not reduced its vigilance.
We must be attentive to continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, Economic Policy Minister Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries showed clear signs of a downturn in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts the fractures in the world economy, showed that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell four-tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the 100-point average, after falling by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives rise to doubts
Papademos said the adjustment would be approved, but the Conservatives would not sign any written commitments.
With peripheral risk premiums and uncertainties reigning in the parks, Greece continues to wander the maze that leads to a way out of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new Hellas transitional government is imposed by Brussels’ demands rather than the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While new Prime Minister Lucas Papademos warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment may not be enough to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assures that he will not support the new austerity measures in any case.
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on October 26, Papademos said yesterday, opening the parliamentary debate, which will be crowned tomorrow with a vote of confidence of the new executive power.
A package of 24 programs to increase employment, reform the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear up any doubts about his position: “We are ready to help the transitional government, but we make no promises.”
The Conservative leader took a step further in his sentiments about the EU and the IMF, the organizations that must defrost the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of consent to the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect of Papandreou’s all-or-nothing referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unambiguous: it will not resume aid unless the new government and the leaders of Greece’s main parties sign a “written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible.”
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeu Altafai said the troika’s inspectors could “very soon” return to Athens to discuss with the new government “what needs to be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although an exact date has not yet been set.
In the Greek ball there will be enough thread for a while.
Sofia: “These are tools of progress and hope”
The Queen stressed the "main" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain has “taken a prominent place in the world in the field of microfinance”.
Queen Sophia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades the country has become the second largest donor in terms of instruments of cooperation, whose “essence”, she said, is that it is “an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on faith in people”.
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such action is “absolutely necessary” to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals by 2015 and “especially with the aim of halving the number of people living by less than one dollar a day”, the level at which “the misfortune is fixed”.
Spain is “still working” to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes on this task with all “responsibility”, says dona Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements made during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, the “principal recipients of these loans”.
There are “many achievements” and “many difficulties we face.”
The microcredit summit is becoming not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that promotes “two main goals.”
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will benefit from these financial services and one hundred million of these households will emerge from the poverty in which they are immersed.
The impetus for the creation of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world "was on the path begun years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, Ms. Sofia stressed, as an "act of justice and recognition".
And she described the instrument’s father as “a striking idealist in the general cause of poverty alleviation,” whose work has been known for 15 years, since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study on the spot his lending policies.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d’Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I have seen continuous development everywhere,” said Her Majesty, whose connection to this project earned her yesterday the title of “head of the family” assembled in Valladolid by the “banker of the poor.”
Finally, Queen Sophia concluded her speech by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"The Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said solidarity is an "ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries with times of economic boom, as it is a “permanent commitment”.
Jimenez concluded that microcredit entails a “serious and firm course to eradicate poverty” and that now “more than ever” governments in developed countries must work according to the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to become a victim of spending cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, praised the “success” in giving “confidence” to the “deprived people, to whom all doors are closed”, and Mayor of Valladolid Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed everyone present in the city, which “opens its doors in a spirit of solidarity”.
CDU proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal vote
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, was without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program, but emerged in the autumn itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that the government's policy is far from as strict as it should be today with regard to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with regard to Italy.
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, submitted for discussion by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
Standing ovations, lasting a few minutes, which deserved his speeches Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, Europhile and Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct response to the crisis is "no less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the chancellor, “it’s time for a breakthrough in Europe.”
It could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty that make it possible for the European Union to strengthen its control over the eurozone’s financial policies, but it could also affect the European Commission’s general election of the president “to give Europe a face.”
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which apparently belongs to Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree to this decision; the UK opposes it, and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also against it.
The soil is prepared.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh each member state’s vote on the board of the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of each of them’s economies, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In a bid to calm down her party, the chancellor increased the number of references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence Congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in dire straits who like to criticize "arrogant" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devotes an entire paragraph to the importance of “German-French friendship,” Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just passing through.
Recalling that two centuries ago Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What Is Hospital Letter Fraud?
Following cash benefits, the UMP and the government launched an offensive on sick leave.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the family benefit distribution fund and deliver a speech on the issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on the fight against social benefit fraud.
And to help this offensive, born of the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also part of the right-wing campaign for re-election to the presidency, most want to concentrate on sick leave.
First of all, with budget savings in mind, the Government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on employees of private companies before the benefit begins to be paid.
Obviously, without the special consent of the employer, the sick employee will lose a salary in four days, equal to at least 15% of his / her monthly income.
The measure, which threatens to trigger a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will result in savings of 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose on public servants one day without payment of sickness benefit (public servants so far have not had to wait for payment of benefit, as opposed to the three-day waiting for private sector employees).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority is also once again raising the topic of fraud, referring to abuses in the issuance of sick leave.
The controls will be tougher and if you are caught, you will have to return all the payments you illegally received,” Bertrand warned on RTL on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of sick leave.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subjected to constant monitoring and political attacks that are bearing fruit.
People in France are sick no more than anywhere else in Europe.
First, let’s look at the country’s numbers.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily compensation costs of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 million in 2008 accounted for 5% of total health care spending.
Of this amount, 46% were related to maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% to sickness benefits, which amounted to 6.2 million euros.
And, therefore, accounted for 2.5% of health-related costs.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days on sick leave in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
An average arithmetic that hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by career management site Monster.com found that 75% of 40,000 French workers surveyed said they hadn’t taken a single day off sick.
Another study, this time on health insurance, claims that in 2010 37% of hospitalized patients lasted less than 8 days, 15% of 15 days to one month, 15% of one to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
If you compare these figures with the figures of European neighbors, you can see that French workers are no more inclined to take sick leave than workers of any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absenteeism in France (for health reasons or not) fluctuated between 10% and 11%, compared to 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with sick leave is very low compared to “grey” employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has led to a systematic check-up of hospitals lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 findings about short-term illness were “unjustified” or too long, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked sick leave for more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were “inappropriate or unreasonable”, which equals 132,000.
Overall, it turns out that 169,000 cases were “unreasonable” for several million workers who received sick leave.
Figures that show very few cases compared, for example, with figures for “grey” employment.
According to UMP deputy Dominic Tiane, author of the report on the issue in June, they account for between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000 million of missed budget revenues per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and is therefore infinitely higher than the losses from fraud.
Papademos: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papademos told parliament on Monday, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition government were not enough to accomplish the task.
"In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program," the head of government said, making his first public statement, opening a debate on a confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 should be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's presence in the eurozone is "on the map", he added.
Accordingly, Papademos forecasts the country’s budget deficit to decline “to about 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new government's measures.
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with lawmakers from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debts and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that hinders the recovery of the economy.
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000 million loan without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, says committee of experts
Canadians are denied death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
Regarding palliative medicine, the committee argues that the government, health institutes, and doctors are working together to provide the best palliative care possible, not counting cancer cases.
Canadians are not allowed to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which brought together six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee proposes that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death.”
Because of medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report concludes that it contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse in application, i.e. euthanasia or suicide with help against people who cannot or do not want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during a teleconference that the majority of such cases were in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Suicide with help is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favor of euthanasia because, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid, they believe that it will allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not be a signal that the lives of older people or people with disabilities are of less value.
As for people who assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As for the extension or termination of medical care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also suggest, among other recommendations, that the criminal code should establish that legally valid termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for the refusal of end-of-life medical care without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee encourages the government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best palliative care possible, and not just in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requires that it be applied when it is not used to dull physical pain like euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some health-related legislation experts have already commented on the conclusion of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, described the position of the experts who signed the report as “extreme” because, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says Metro Deschan, who yesterday discussed the summary of the report.
Deschamps also emphasized that the authors of the report seem to put the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that "there are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
Healthcare law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed “categorical disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called the “euthanasia manifesto.”
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes in particular the report’s data on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Urges President Assad to Cede Power
Damascus condemns 'conspiracy'
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure increased on Syria by Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after Syria's suspension of membership in the Arab League, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria's neighbors Turkey and Jordan called for President Assad's resignation.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II on Sunday became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to cede power in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime’s armed forces were killed.
“If the interests of his country were expensive for Bashar, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new stage of political life,” the king of Jordan, a neighboring country to Syria, told the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu expressed regret that Turkey’s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, have not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, hinting at Syria, a neighboring country towards which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “expanding consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly tough course towards repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s armed forces were killed in the Deraa area of southern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed in a shootout and heavy machine gun fire at Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to the ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said the country was nearing the end of the crisis.
In addition, he reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which, according to him, is a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this plot against Syria will fail.
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently exploring “a mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers to come to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also called for UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said had fallen into “paranoia.”
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November, which includes, inter alia, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities where the fighting is taking place and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the decision of the Arab League “incorrect”, while China urged Syria to implement the plan for a way out of the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
ITALY
Monti demands time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
Italy’s future Prime Minister Mario Monti has asked the markets for some time to form his team and execute a program that will require “sacrifices” to restore creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi’s rule.
The former European Commissioner took part in discussions with political parties yesterday ahead of today’s meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet composed of technocrats who are not in parliament.
Monti spoke about the importance of a program that involves many casualties, said Francesco Noucara, a spokesman for one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the discussions following a meeting with a candidate for prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament to vote confidence before Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The meeting will conclude with the submission by Mr. Monti of a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of the country, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on yesterday’s nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them for time.
In a democracy, it takes time to prepare the government and the program, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that the markets would be patient and understanding.
His appointment as president was initially endorsed by the markets, but concerns resurfaced, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister was to form a team, including, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians.”
The new government will have to operate until 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
Speaker of the House of Deputies Gianfranco Fini said the new government would receive a vote of confidence in parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti guaranteed that once he took office, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important actor in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: “Despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed.”
Convinced that Rome will not meet its budget for 2013, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, the European Union has demanded, inter alia, new austerity measures.
Italian boss Emma Marchegaglia, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet deficit parameters."
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence during his time as European Commissioner (1994-2004), presents the “change of the era” for Italy after 17 years of “Berlusconianism”, a “professor” symbolizing the “challenge of seriousness” and “a different Italy”, according to the authors of the foreword.
The great unknown is the durability of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid snap elections, as Italy is due to make payments on public debt worth 200,000 million euros by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, a U.S. agency specializing in nuclear hazards confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) draws on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other UN documents to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, “since the 1960s, at the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by explosive methods.”
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to create a company producing "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then collaborated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its report, the IAEA mentions “clear signs that Iran’s development of a nuclear detonator system” was facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technique well, but who also told the agency that he had worked most of his career on this technology as part of his home country’s military nuclear program.”
Anti-Muslim Crimes Increased by 50%
According to statistics released Monday by the FBI, anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50% between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined slightly or remained unchanged over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49%, compared to a 13% increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in attacks against Jews and a 14% increase in the total number of religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that the number of these crimes is rising again, Human Rights First emphasizes, "the increase in cases of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in an official statement.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be treated as serious human rights violations,” said Paul Legendre, one of the leaders of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to tackle these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reporting on hate crimes.”
“Hate crimes” in federal law are a legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King, to punish acts of violence related to race, color, religion, nationality and today sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and becoming similar to Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter made changes to the presentation of its platform, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, which makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new “activity” tab and another “name” allow you to more easily and directly track the activities of other “twitters”, Internet users whose messages (“tweets”) you are tracking, and those who are tracking yours.
This makes it possible to find out if they will publish messages, if they will subscribe to new accounts, if they will have selected messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested on a “small percentage of users in August” before being widely used across the network on Monday, a spokeswoman for Twitter, Carolyn Penner, told AFP.
Twitter, which has long been known to be intuitively rather obscure and to use rather vague terms (RT for overlaying someone else’s message, #followfriday for recommending tracking other users), is mainly bringing pleasure to experienced users, thus opening itself up to a wider audience by presenting users with something closer to popular social media and Facebook.
On the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of "tweets" on the Internet.
“It’s useless, it’s intrusive and it resembles Facebook too much.”
Functional activity will help me better follow certain elements of my Twitter stream, wrote <0x40>dannykronstrom.

Introducing the “Golden Rule” of the Budget to the Constitution
The leadership of the large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write the budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade by rating agencies of the state credit rating of Austria (triple A).
Social-Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann personally announced the decision at the end of the Council of Ministers meeting, with Austria’s public debt standing at 74.6%, well above the 60% threshold set by the Maastricht Treaty but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria’s solvency had fallen by just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest by three thousand million euros more each year, argued Vice Chancellor and Christian Democrat Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Thus, Austria complies with the demand of the Eurozone summit on October 26 in Brussels; the heads of state and government demanded a reduction of budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The ruling by the Austrian government resembles the "German model" because Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule".
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should be reduced each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP), and from 2017 the structural deficit of the state budget of the federal state in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and lands, like communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to force the public debt to fall below the 60% mark set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esihiko Noda
threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities will conduct new interventions in the foreign exchange market if the value of the yen continues to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the exchange rate of the yen, explained Mr. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose almost to a historic level, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On this day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new strength record since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown steadily, driven by the purchases of investors who perceive it as a “safe haven” in these turbulent times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic level of 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen, and the euro more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is damaging Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the amount of income of Japanese firms from abroad when converted into the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to recover" from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Mr. Noda said, who fears the yen's rise will kill the fragile embryo of recovery.
The world's third-largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to the growth of exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect Japan’s “fundamental economic performance.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “appropriate steps”, making it clear that no further easing was expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of Treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (47 million euros), raising to 55,000 million yen (519 million euros) the ceiling of the amounts it allocates for the purchase of various financial instruments to saturate the securities market.
Eurozone
Rates rise, stock exchanges fluctuate
The risk of a debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges went a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 am, CAC 40 lost 1.4% and finished trading at 3,064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell to 0.4% and London to 0.1%.
Due to the new difficulties in repaying loans to euro area countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“Worry investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% fall under the weight of new market participants' doubts about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has shifted its gaze to Europe, and exchanges will follow each other in a corridor of narrow change until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Aquino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of concern about the future of the eurozone hits the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest point in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, falling 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after the congress of the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel CDU on Monday, at which a resolution was adopted, providing, in particular, the possibility for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly higher than 6%
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level that raises concerns.
On Tuesday morning, Italian 10-year bond yields reached 6.85% and Spanish bond yields with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These difficulties with interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel participants’ fears.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the time exchanges to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened with paralysis under the weight of its debt.
Greece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 will be his government’s “principal task”.
Spain has come under fire from markets ahead of Sunday’s parliamentary elections.
The spread between interest rates on 10-year debt obligations of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
In anticipation of growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, despite this, revised down the second quarter figures, with a 0.1% drop in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogma
If there is a topic that cannot be decided after a brief discussion or under the influence of emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings become a reason to reflect on the share and place occupied by nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options have been explored.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
With 7,000 million people on the planet now, demographic development will double the need for electricity by 2050, unless the vast majority of the world’s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to make up for the growing scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue producing electricity continuously, not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate imbalances – a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear power, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who continue their projects decisively.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one installation to its kit, resuming the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident on Three Mile Island.
Although Germany’s renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, aggravated by an increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal plants.
After a few months, all these unpleasant effects will already be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European turbine builder, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to intermittent wind; which causes carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices, respectively, to be 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalised economy the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the key to the maintenance of industrial equipment on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country’s energy policy made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect ones.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a pleiade of internationally traded small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be relocated to another industry.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What kind of electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years if its manufacturer was scheduled to close?
To solve the energy equation, one must admit that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of security is undoubtedly a vital issue.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centers such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is universally recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
Over the course of 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any consequences for humans or the environment.
In Chernobyl, a reactor device and an unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident, as it has learned from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is being considered by all energy experts wishing to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to competitors Areva and EDF, clearing them the way to gain the leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased maneuvers to prevail in a dispute that is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a benefit to the economy?
Immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative services, subject to the policy of figures and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a "human rights state".
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which got into the news when the Minister of the Interior (Liberación dated May 23) stated that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waiters".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The left and the right agree a lot on this.
The right-wing tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers", and the left by Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France "cannot accept the poor from all over the world".
The only difference is the level of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of invading the territory of the Polish hordes plumber felt both left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity they will allow to show to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confined himself to trivialities, saying that “jointly working together will solve our immigration problem.”
This view of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but it is very costly economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarizing the latest data on immigration (Special People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among professionals about the positive impact of migration flows in countries that take it into account in terms of economic growth, wages and wages.
Restricting immigration weakens growth and reduces employment.
Fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the idea that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled ones, provoking lower wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are far more complementary than they are replacing the local workforce by doing jobs for which the local workforce is lacking.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract a local workforce, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not tied to job offers.
Positive impact on salaries
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity that exists between locals and immigrants leads to the fact that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in migratory flows leads to a 0.6-0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
And this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to new ideas and economic growth (among the American Nobel Prize winners a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also bring net profits to social security systems, giving an average of 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, in Germany, an immigrant, arriving at the age of 30, will bring to the state budget a net profit (income minus expenditure) of 150,000 euros on average.
Nicolas Sarkozy at the beginning of his mandate was going to “tooth” to grasp the missing growth points.
The aforementioned teeth, which were used to scare away immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but at the same time fragile.
The European continent must remember that, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it was enough to organize a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since the time of Napoleon the "Little" it is known that this comes from the superficiality of thinking.
The universal vote, while a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient prerequisite, and may even become an “instrument of repression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vashro once said.
No, democracy requires many other things - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this respect, the palinody of the truth-and-false Greek referendum will have a double revealing effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious policy change and the unpleasant sense of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now shifted and, according to many, Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We will gain nothing by demanding a series of national referendums organized as needed and in a chaotic manner.
"Carte blanche" for an absolute European monarch or a leap with tied feet into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of a guillotine blade, but of the exercise – jointly, clearly and continuously – of choice and democracy, this time at a pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent to return the management of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because only by working together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of everyone’s debt, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The way out of the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the socialists and Jacques Delors are all now demanding a European economic government.
Let it be.
But to imagine it without stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which has entered into force, is another madness and a new impasse.
We need to start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
A revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a Europe that is united at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a real people’s European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are spreading more and more widely.
The world exhibition of chip cards opens Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM-cards), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6 thousand million units.
The most important is the contactless technology sector, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases simply by holding a card over a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and will account for almost 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, long behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the field of contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature, and they are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France starts from a more modest position: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are in circulation.
But big shops are growing at a pace.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards.
To move to a higher speed, banks need to equip their customers with equipment.
“Two large organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute to their customers in the future bank cards adapted for contactless use,” said Gerard Nebois, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage in the development of the future means of payment, that is, the mobile phone.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to perform such transactions.
“They were postponed.
"But they should really blow up next year."
"We expect global sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
The banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced that it would conduct an experiment from December to June next year in Cana.
The iPhones of approximately 200 customers and employees will be provided with cases that provide contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to launch an offer on the market that allows its customers to pay via mobile phones.
Terrorist Front Spreads from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the Islamic Maghreb’s ties to the Boko Haram sect.
The long-anticipated links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's deputy foreign minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algerians are now convinced of this.
“The way these two organizations are using and the intelligence reports show that they are actively cooperating,” he said, without going into detail.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French men in Niger in January revealed two links.
Abducted at a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocourt and Vincent Delory were apparently killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces.
Among the wreckage left after the operation, French and Nigeri investigators found several phone SIM cards belonging to the terrorists.
The Axis of Terror
The analysis of the calls indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one pointing to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other pointing to a person allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but we certainly need to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect is receiving financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly apparent in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and in her methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community, led by Washington, is now putting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems Boko Haram is creating.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of enlightened people of no interest.
Rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri near a mosque, school, and imam-fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram—which in hausa means “Western education is a sin”—preachs the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict adherence to Sharia, and its activists have begun the fight against the wicked central government.
It is aimed mainly at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction, as usual, was uncompromising.
The army blockaded the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalized and will go beyond its northern patrimony.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June in Abuja, Boko Haram staged the first suicide attack on a fortified police headquarters.
In August, the local office of the United Nations will be their first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security experts.
Today, with Aqmi gaining ground in Mali and Niger and the Somalis from al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with Goodluck President Jonathan Allen Juppé warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed readiness to share all the information available.
The world as seen by Republican presidential candidates
Regarding China, Iran, and Israel’s aid, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and incompetence.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, or rather simplistic, ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe it.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying loud, but devoid of details, foreign policy statements that have traditionally been the Republicans’ strong suit.
Slogans concerning China, Iran and aid to Israel are often confused with each other.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of being nominated by the “Old Good Party”, threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of “manipulating their currency is a sensitive topic for America, annoyed by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
“It’s even worse if it leads to a trade war,” he said.
John Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a knack for complicated foreign policy, has been unable to overcome an emotion-indulgent stance.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who holds at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard of.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they’ll have a bomb.”
He also vowed to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to deliver on his promises to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second in the ranking of candidates, has demonstrated discouraging ignorance of cases.
He recently called for confronting China’s military threat because Beijing is trying to gain nuclear power – apparently unaware that China already has it since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
Torture of suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
All this is very far from Republican candidate of 2008 John McCain, the heavyweight of foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president respond that Reagan, too, had simple ideas and that he had won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to lower his tone in the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the “boys” from Iraq, his tricks in Libya, which have earned him a reputation as a weak politician.
But the offensive is not so easy.
The population considers a positive balance of national security under Obama, who eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are stranded in the sand.
And, arguing that America needs to rebuild economically to regain its leadership, Obama is right.
Nord Stream, a new gateway for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, connecting Western Europe and Russia directly on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It is designed to supply gas to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate the event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the orchestra’s performance and exquisite snacks, in the opening of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mart Rutte together turned a symbolic valve controlling the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
Under the new pipeline, 27,500 million additional cubic meters of gas will be supplied to Western Europe each year through the first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the Leningrad region with the land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The second pipeline should be ready by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas equivalent to the entire consumption of France.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic states.
Nord Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
The two countries will lose some of their power: it will become more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the heaviest moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop at comparing the Nord Stream to the new "German-Soviet Pact", hinting at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin with the aim of occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is achieving greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has achieved its understanding of the direct alliance between Russia and wealthy Western countries that consume large volumes of gas and whose own reserves are already running out.
“This pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it’s a new artery that organically binds us,” Fillon said, opening the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel encased in concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left over from the Second World War.
“A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesperson for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing the weight of 242 Eiffel Towers, without bursts along its entire length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the Swedish area, but project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not thrilled that a Russian state-owned company would settle permanently off its shores.
“In the event of an accident, we will cut off the flow of gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline will go into the air.
But that seems unlikely to designers who designed seams designed to leak only once every 100,000 years.
Control over the state of the pipeline will be carried out by an underwater robot, which pulls the ship, for external observation, as well as a device circulating inside the pipeline.
The cigar-shaped apparatus is inserted into the pipe with a diameter of 1 meter and pushed forward by a gas flow.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it gives accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the slightest repair.
The circulation of gas is carried out only at the expense of its pressure.
It is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was tasked with building and operating the pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Then Gazprom leased the company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
“Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas is actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works will be 7.4 million euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez will invest around $240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay back their costs, because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline exits from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy shore planted with coniferous trees.
The valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity it will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine brand notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company fifteen years ago, will bring back the taste of writing.
He has the scent of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easy to recognize by the rectangular black cover, by the elastic, by the yellowish-white pages, as if yellowed with time.
The Moleskine notebook, however, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to launch designer notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant to the company, took responsibility for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique, moleskin - lacquered cotton fabric, used, for example, for covering benches.
This type of notebook is said to be highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine aligned with today’s taste an old and forgotten thing that was iconic for avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the managing brand at Modo Modo.
Success has arrived.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales grew by 25% to reach 12.7 million units.
We were far from producing the first few years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed the borders of Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish the profile of a typical buyer, because the notebook equally attracts a businessman, a student and a person of the free profession.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, have broad views and are educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in Fnac bookstores, shops in the centers of small towns and has been able to gain wide fame.
“We followed the spirit of the time and this new need for a letter, despite the advent of email,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This distinctive cultural trait accompanies the development of Moleskine; recently the brand organized an exhibition “Around the Road”, where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched covers with a leopard pattern on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its successes and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags. The brand includes all kinds of support.
In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for disabled people begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities is still twice the average, namely 19 per cent versus 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Discouraged?
“No,” said Eric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for disabled people.
“In 15 years, significant progress has been made.”
"At that time, the share of unemployed was not 2 times, but 3 times more."
“But there is still a lot of work ahead.”
There are many barriers to employment for people with disabilities.
Among them are more elderly: 37% older than 50 years (17% on average).
Rather, they have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor’s degree, and out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85% for the disabled versus 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to get back to work and that are at the heart of the problem,” says Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a mentality that is changing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association commissioned by Cité found that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disability and "imagined solid people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally impaired."
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6% disabled workers set out in a law passed in 1987.
The latest known figures for 2008 are 2.6%.
“Today we’re at about 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that don’t comply with the law.
Evidence: The number of “taxable” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased in 2007-2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law that raised the tax put a lot of pressure on companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects an increase in awareness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with a number of employees from 20 to 49 have employees with disabilities, compared to 82% of organizations with a number of employees from 100 to 199.
Hazard: "What a happiness"
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday evening (20.45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match.
We will not come to the point of claiming that there was a collusion between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other at the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after his striker’s stunt against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he is Belgian."
“I want to go further,” Lillia assures the player.
As for the contrast between his achievements at the club and at the national team, it is one whole.
"I'm in Lille all year round, but not in Belgium."
“I need to get my glasses.”
Left in reserve, on the eve of this match against France, in a game against Romania on Friday evening, Hazard came to Saint-Denis to finally "shin".
Not forgetting, however, the concept of "pleasure".
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I have always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of this match.
And especially the fact that on the other side are Mathieu (Debuschy), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami),” he recalls.
“Our paths just crossed.”
“To be able to play against them is pure happiness.”
Leekens remembered "pride" kindly.
"Pride" to play in the "holiday match."
"Pride" also claims as a "neighbor" that France "became a very high-level team again" just a year after its injury in Naizna.
"Laurent Blanc was like a thunderbolt, he admires.
Now, when Belgium misses the next Euro, the technical athlete will fly in the same plane with the leadership of the Blues... to Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll see that in future matches, including this one against France."
Portugal is very confident.
Portugal's Paulo Bento starts his rematch against Bosnia (22.00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to lose their sense of reality.
“By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paul Bent is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the national team, which he has been at the helm since September 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match to be played and Bosnia to be won.
Given the 0-0 on Friday in Zenica hell, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the coveted goal that would reassure her.
“It’s a good result, but it involves some risk.”
But at home, in their brightly lit de la Luz stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the audience, who should be delighted, although the match will be very tense," said the optimistic but sensible Bento.
"We are expecting a very intense match, but we are convinced that we can win," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
A draw on Friday in a match against Bosnia demands a victory from the Portuguese.
No one could get the Bosnians.
"It's a good result, but there's some risk," Bentu said.
“We will play against a team that has many technical merits and players who have many individual merits,” he added.
As was already the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosniaks from the very beginning, "not giving them time to think."
It's a good idea, if only it was realistic this time.
