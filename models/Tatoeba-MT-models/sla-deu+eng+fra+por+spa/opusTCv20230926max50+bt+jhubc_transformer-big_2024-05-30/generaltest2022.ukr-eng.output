We promised that when you went to school, we would bring you a surprise.
Hello, I agree to the course.

Because I don’t live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transport.
If there are no options, I still agree.
Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people again went to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
According to the agency, the participants of the event, Kherson managed to hold a rally before the Russian military arrived in place for dispersal with equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now the equipment of the Russian Federation has arrived there," - said one of the participants of the event.
Earlier, citizens traditionally gathered for protests on Freedom Square - near the state administration building and the regional council.
This square, like the building, is now controlled by armed Russian troops using weapons against participants in rallies and kidnapping people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
According to Ukrinform, residents of the Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military is using force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders are kidnapping residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy honored Kherson with a special title "City Hero".
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, it will stop fighting – we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that fighting for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the Ukrainian Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and once again occupy the de-occupied territories.
“Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights – we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city – ed.) are people who have drawn on themselves a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the OOS, and if they are stronger, the table of negotiations will be closer to us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for that too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Sadly, we are stating.
We believe in our results, in our victory.”
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to talks after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
“People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, on the terms of Ukraine’s independence, but... every family has lost something – and I don’t think they will be satisfied by any peace on any terms.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace, or it will end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million casualties, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight, but for life.
You can’t fight for dust when there’s nothing, no people.”
Good afternoon, do you still have places available for a Czech course for adults from 19:00 on Tuesday?

Due to the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts are needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, state research
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in contemporary literature allows us to analyze the postmodern context as such, where the metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports on Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine obtained a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha," the report reads.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine notes that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and brought to justice.
You can view the list by link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kiev region were liberated from the Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, mass killings of civilians by the Russian military have been recorded.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, said that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of the Kiev region liberated from the Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian invaders shell and destroy key infrastructure objects, carry out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, air bombs.

We promised that when you went to school, we would bring you a surprise.
Bulob is great , I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal mockery of the civilian population north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other as to how this could have happened in the 21st century?! How?!
But I was not surprised at all. What is happening is exactly what I was sadly waiting for...
I took the children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then girls-colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and for a moment did not doubt that in case of occupation the suburbs of Kiev will not spare my family.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communal-KGBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in Zhytomyr.
Several years ago, the SBU in Zhytomyr was given to remove a copy of the shooting case of his great-grandfather: the whole case is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence of execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The defendant was illiterate and denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, he was of free people, a poor "commonwealth" nobility, never went in serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was enough to condemn the pahar and feeder of young children to execution.
The family did not even know about the burial place.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In criminal cases, there is a surname of the snitch Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and would not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informant.
The apple from the apple tree, as you know, falls...
The three men who executed the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are in Russia wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources such as "Immortal barracks", which qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
The people who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalin’s repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers were first discredited and then destroyed by the system.
Apparently, files with child pornography were found on the computer, they were sent to prison for it, and there he quickly died.
The KGB is still killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
It concentrates the most vile features of human nature.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries overlapped a thousand-year-old Ordinal tradition.
And then on what turned out, they did an animal genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" in 1992, that's how it was.

Can you ask your wife what I can buy from a cough .

Everyone is following the Facebook page.
They asked to send you congratulations and say that it is very interesting for them to read the news.
We also talked about people of Roma nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if the child comes and the parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them in the phone mode.

But it's not necessarily . Only if it is. I'm very grateful to you too .
I feel sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had many questions to ask God why there were situations in my life that just made me despair in everything.
Do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.

I can't call the doctor because I haven't done a food license test yet.
But I can't call him because I'm out of money.
I can not recharge the phone because I do not understand the Czech online banking and the Ukrainian bank card is not recharged.
In the application Vodafone I can neither change the tariff so that I had normal calls and the Internet or replenish the number.

As reported by "European truth", writes Welt with reference to sources in the government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the variant of the BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by the Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place on a circular basis.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the gaps that have been formed will then be filled by industry at the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Are we in the morning or in the afternoon together?
Thank you, we will find how to replenish flabby and naberkmo. I will write you back. Thank you

A man and a woman decide the issues themselves in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we get there.
Why not try it this way?

Sorry to bother you.
I was upset that Kolya and I started translating the test badly yesterday.
I will ask either Grigory Denysenko or maybe Yonashek)) to help me at least a little with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be useful to them?
If possible, I'd like to do some math over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work with Kolya so that it was without mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also very much hope for that.
And so she is very happy with any gift
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn’t stay away.
Now we have agreed to be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in Hall 29 is specially designed for the submission and processing of applications for assistance

Don’t be afraid that no one will come.
I did not go. Yes, I baked. I can do it! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
Are you going to be out of town for a long time?
Six months ago, at the Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babi Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of the “common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and to live in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
This foundation we must defend – it is also part of our responsibility related to our history.”
“If the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes,” he said, “there can be only one answer for us Germans: never again!
The struggle must continue.”
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving the inhabitants of its blockaded cities and allowing them to die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, Germans see this in real-time news.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which not so long ago it was impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never Again!" means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting with all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
There's a song for you tonight
We agree, arrange a tour, and write when to be collected
All sick only Lydia was not sick in them was omicron a new kind of covid

Serhiy Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the Donbas war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, increased.
After the beginning of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in the conditions of war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its member countries – for the untimely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to “irritate” Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspirations for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military.
In the new episode of the podcast "Damned Questions" together with the editor of "European Truth" we talk about exactly how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of membership in NATO is as close as ever before.
What do you think is here
I have a volt partner marked that my statement is under consideration.

Yes, there was heart disease.
I had a sincere feeling for this man, but he didn’t do very well and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized to me.
I refused him.
Then after a while he called that he had had heart surgery.
I just wanted to talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I’ve been mentally supportive for almost half a year.
We talked a lot during that time.
Then I started having problems at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
So much mutual help.
And I was thinking, maybe I really need to look at it differently.
He asked me to marry him, and two days later he died.
God has decided our own destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He only speaks Czech.

The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say “never before”
Konashenkov said: "We see attempts of sabotage and targeting of objects on the territory of the Russian Federation by Ukrainian troops.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army previously refrained.
The Russians carried out missile strikes on Kiev from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the occupying forces of the Russian Federation in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remnants of Russian missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital, Poznyaky.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit a TV tower in Dorogozhychi near Babi Yar, killing five passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
March 14, the wreckage of the downed missile of the occupants crushed the house and trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping mall on Vinogrador, killing at least four people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that the residents of the capital, who were evacuated from the city, so far it is too early to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, on the outskirts of the capital a lot of mines and unexploded ordnance.
The main intelligence department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation to blame the Ukrainians and to justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil base exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgorod stated that allegedly a “Ukrainian shell” fell near the city.
Obviously, the elites in both Washington and Berlin are sweating cold from the very thought that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of people in the squares of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this subtle alloy of strength, touch, and sometimes despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
While the same Biden strongly opposes the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine’s accession, the process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be seen as a scammer.
The money you collect is better to give to people in need.

Contact: ------ I would like a letter so that the Czechs could write to you through a translator, SMS does not go here, they do not have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, then you will not agree.
You really don't want that price?
It helps people see what they are worth and what they have for it.
If you don't need a price list, I won't put it up.
Tell yourself how you want it and I will do it.
You didn’t want to write to me today.
Don't worry, I'm not here to ask for anything.
Today, I am just asking for your attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I ask you to be patient.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, vacation.
You have a dream.
You are planning to buy this dress that you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can’t accept it.
He's clinging to the old reality.
You call to work, to find out whether to go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There's hope... it's not for long.
Now .... agree ... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go ?? I have no one and nowhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket, all we've spent at home.
Many of our managers did not pay wages at our jobs.
Where do I go ?? Who needs me ? How do I provide for children ? Where do I live ?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything out of the house... you're going 1,000 kilometers.
You don't know if you'll have them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag the children all over Prague.
What's next? Unknown. How much is it? Unknown. Children ask for sweets. And you can't. It's expensive to you.
And from every iron - we do not have this.
We have a choice: to stay there and put our children in danger, or to try to escape here.
She was very happy with those hearts and those things the kids gave her when she came to school.

Today we have joy - our city of Bucha was liberated from the invaders, our troops fled.
There is a clearing from the enemy - looking for Russians in the basements and apartments.
The whole city is mined, the demining work will begin.
And Ivan would see, maybe something there needs to be repaired or something else to finish.
Maybe he'll be embarrassed, I don't know.
Our Lord wants to stay at home, says that he is tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We'll bake a masonry and do the lessons.
These are small entrepreneurs who opened volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
These are tractor drivers who actually go out into the field under shelling, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who today agree to go in gum convoys to temporarily occupied territories to take help there and pick up people from there.
These are heroic leaders who go to the combat zone without fear, calm and help refugees in the wagons, and at peaceful stations help volunteers to load humanitarian aid into the wagons.
These are the gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the early days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are communal workers who take out garbage under shelling, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, without complaining about anything, and in their free time they still volunteer, collecting first aid kits for the front.
In Ukraine, the juice stops when the little ones have leaves)

My daughter is 8 years old, this age is acceptable?
I am looking for accommodation for me and my daughter for 3-4 days every day to come to the Czech Republic and transfer passports to apply for a visa to Canada.
In Warsaw, there are a lot of people in the visa center and do not work on-line queue.
I wanted to come for one day, but it is far away, it takes a lot of time to travel by train, it will be difficult for the child.
So I decided to look for a place to stay in Prague or near it.
No, we're fine.
Yesterday's devices where to bring

In the Foreign Electoral District, only nationwide ballots are held: elections of the President and people's deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.

Very tasty apples, what kind is it?
Head of the President’s Office Andriy Yermak said that Russia is launching a “fake operation” on the weapons that the allies hand over to us.
Yermak: "They understand that they are losing the war, they see their backwardness and they want to "kill" the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 SAM delivered by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What happens next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I'll name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers seem to surrender with weapons from the Allies, and it is massively transferred to the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn such fakes.
After all, weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the other world.
Excuse me, I forgot to ask how much a garden will cost per month and whether it will work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and indignation at the emergence of evidence that Russian forces committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these reports as a “provocation”.
“The reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worthy of condemnation,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer to the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a “violation of international law.”
The statements came after reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha, by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russia's coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit “genocide” in Bucha.
“We will do everything possible to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,” Sánchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a “provocation”.
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO “ordered” the image to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me, the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who “ordered” this story,” Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also said without evidence that the image of Bucha is "another staging of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
On April 4, the Russian Investigative Committee released a statement announcing an “investigation” on charges of spreading by Ukraine “knowingly false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing “genocide” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out,” Zelensky said in a video message, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
There is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shots in the back of the head,” he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don’t understand,” he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Liberty on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city bodies as if civilians.
Only in one place the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP reporters have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations around Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people – all civilians – were scattered on the ground near a place that locals said was being used by Russian forces as a base.
It looks like the victims were killed at close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the Kiev area, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kiev." How the occupiers smuggled Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
In this list there is another item, about which there is much less information – the removal of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
Around mid-March, Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave up under the Russian military training ground.
“Ukrainian Pravda” searched for the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same “evacuation” is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text were forced to voluntarily evacuate outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from despair.
Luckily, they are alive and keeping in touch with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were deported to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
Thus, in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took away from there children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine in swimming Josyp Zachepinsky.
The family of Oleksandr, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the airport "Antonov", located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military town, although it was a civilian.
As true plastuns, Denis and Marina collected alarming suitcases in advance, but on the morning of February 24 they did not have time to evacuate.
They did not have their own car, and the suburban buses did not take anyone.
At about 12 o'clock on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighbor’s house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, when the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 p.m. on February 24, people entered the entrance who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask, “Is there anyone?” – I say yes. – “Come out!”.
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were asked if they had served in the army.
The women were told, “We are here to protect you on the orders of Ramzan Kadyrov.”
It was Chechen OMON, not even troops, young guys 25-35 years old.
They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Bily (he commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we were missing.
We say that the water with it was a big problem.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for the food.
So after the robbery of the store they brought the sausage and say: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovych."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, “You have seven days to give our phones back” – they laughed.
They were constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, the Ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything, because our families are there."
And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
The chickens were brought to themselves, one was tied to one leg by St. George's tape, and to the other - their white tape and called it "the militia".
They came to Egypt unprepared.
I don’t know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten up on Bucha, so that they didn’t even take the dead, they asked us, “Do you have artillery?”
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments – the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to reveal their own or someone else’s.
They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian OMON arrived, and after them – the Omsk paratroopers.
They put 30-40 units of equipment between the houses - our constantly fell into it from the "Bayraktars".
But they came and told us that the APU no longer exists, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" so thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kiev has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us – or a landing officer, or a representative of the FSB – and says that there will be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - it was about Bucha, Hostomel, we thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are being taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don’t want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "Then pity the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started firing from under the house – or “Cities”, or mortars.
And then it flew back... The neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part did not go, saying that it is for traitors of the motherland – they say, “you will be shot, sold for organs”.
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burnt-out, broken equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians were taking the equipment immediately to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Mosquito" we underwent improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in tents of the Red Cross, they gave us tea.
And here we hear shots! Shoots a missile, and you can see the trace – it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, it's the planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were put on a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonka" near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovich, came and said: "Here I am, I'm from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves of yours are caught.
Poor people are suffering!
And we have Lukashenka so good!
Whatever he says, it will be.”
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN mission (at least so they were called) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with documents – my daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to get it on Monday, and on Thursday the war started.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us at all, and in Minsk at the station they said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.
I would like to say that the Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were placed in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
The sanatorium was not held by force.
To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Passing near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, beautifully glows, and then extinguishes.
People who got on the bus in Mozir told that the Russians were constantly shooting from the ranges there.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something if her son was summoned.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is not believed at all.
They say, "You are a liar, we are a peaceful people."
They do not accept that their landfills are used for shelling of Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting for us, who took us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, deciding what we will do next.
There are probably as many Ukrainian flags in Estonia now as there are Estonian flags.”
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with her brother’s family – his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to spend the night in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle will not be able – the house is no longer there.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.
Can’t get to the center on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. And we are always waiting for you!
Thank you for the arrangement, butterflies are beautiful
And in this small apartment does not catch wifi, basically all your questions I answer and now I do not know how to be?And the children from Monday online classes, and there is no Internet.
That is, I will live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this a family that is ready to accept us?

Can we agree on the best way to do this?
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the happy news that the Ukrainian military had liberated the city from the Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupants were expelled from the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed in the street, some were tied up and shot in the back of the head, some of the killed were minors.
Killed and with traces of torture found the head of the village Motyzhyn Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a mass grave, Igor – in the sewer.
On the other side of the road, 20 km from Kiev, the bodies of several undressed women were found wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there will be no one at home.
I ordered a parcel from Germany with DHL.
It was supposed to be delivered to me yesterday, but no one contacted me and the parcel was not delivered, and on the DHL website it was said that the recipient could not be found.
Therefore, the parcel was sent to the post office and indicated the address of this office.

Good afternoon, I'm talking to you with thoughts - you need to learn Czech, and I can not break away from the news.
I talk to you very often. I think you can hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth".
“All the equipment, everything they are already sending, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
So what, when we talk about Mariupol, for example, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
I see 100% support from the leaders of some countries, it really is.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
Asked whether Ukraine had enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: “Not yet, not yet.”
The president also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have had a different appearance.
“It would be different, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war after all," he added.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and I go home

Why not live in a territory where there is no war?
Are you out of your mind??
Have you lived in a warring state?
When prices rose by 100-200%.
When the pain of enterprises does not work.
When there is nowhere to earn.

You come to the town hall, and downstairs at the reception you say that you are looking for Mrs. Krzhkovska, if you are not shown the way and the number of the door to her.
It will be written on his door, is the head of the department.
If you can’t agree, call Dominica, but I believe that everything will go smoothly.
If Mrs. Krzkowska does not come yet, wait a minute, she said that before she has a meeting, then maybe she will be a little delayed, but she knows about you, she ordered you for this 9th hour just so that you could get to the doctor.
Yes, of course, it would be very good to spend time together

He was a very rich man, and he thought that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.

“I tell her that the ‘repair of the TV and radio’ has been delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances have been warned not to snap too much when calling.”
“We have been hiding information about the war from our mother-in-law for a month.
So far it succeeds.
However, Spots (cat – UP) on the crawl and hind legs licked fur – it can be from stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The spot, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga hears poorly and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her "incognito" for a month.
On April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days I lived with her in an apartment as a guerrilla.
They hid the war from her, and the fact that I was around – I came as usual for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her the receiver – she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.
The radio was always near the bed.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her room.
Hearing badly – it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "hodiki", I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then I called everyone who spoke with her. That's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have cleaning 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I hadn't thought about it :)
Hello, if tomorrow we need more help we can come
Is it necessary to order lunch, can I take lunch from home?Do these documents need to be printed, or will they be printed on the spot and I will sign?
I suggest men's, women's, children's haircuts with a trip to you, please write to private messages, price:
I understand you and do not complain, but in my situation I will be looking here.
I tell you the embassies are only here,
The British, who in the ranks of the Armed Forces defended Mariupol, says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The British soldier, who is a member of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Marine Brigade, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their weapons and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aiden Eislin, a British man who has served in the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 2018, the Air Force with reference to members of Eislin’s family and friends, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Eislin, who spoke with him
“We received a message from him: ‘It’s been 48 days, we’ve tried everything we can to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We had no food or ammunition.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon.”
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which participates in the Mariupol defensive operation.
Air Force journalists contacted the mother of the soldier Ann Wood, and she confirmed that on the phone her son informed that they plan to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last phone call, Icelin told about the plans of their unit for capitulation.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intends to surrender to the Russian units, so as not to get without weapons and bullets in the hands of the so-called "kadyrovtsi".
Also in social networks distributed audio recording of the phone conversation, in which allegedly Eislin talks with his acquaintance American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Icelin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Icelyn was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 went to take part in the fight against the terrorists of the so-called "Islamic state" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Icelyn's friends and family called him Johnny, and in social networks he is better known under the nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know if we're together or not.

The Bolsheviks for their losses in the battle fought back in full.
They shot the teacher Dmitry Pavlytsky, his unknown relative, young man Boris Aleksyenko.
Their bodies were thrown into “a deep dungeon filled with earth.”
“There was a dead silence in the city.”
Occasionally, one of the residents flew from house to house.
The bodies of the tortured Bolsheviks were constantly found on the streets.
And maybe I'll really go after you. I need you. I can't do without you.

I am not afraid of work, as I also lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.
When you can bring things
Very interesting tradition you have, we go so for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted the draft law 7176, which is called "Regarding monitoring of potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy".
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy was ... the place where the members of the supervisory board of state companies and state banks meet.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decision-making by the supervisory board of the state company in Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but we do not yet know of any company that has the need to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is understandable – it is an excellent basis to “bring down” all the gains in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establish manual control.
The same as it was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
Moreover, if under the patriotic slogans one harmful bill “flies”, then tomorrow others may take off – for example, you can demolish the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be written about the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the beginning of the war and the bill 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people's elected officials for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our suggestions on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation with the risks of loss of the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for the supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but can it prevent the transfer of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (which make up a majority of the entire composition) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the Supervisory Board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the Supervisory Board, since the law stipulates the need for competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the solution proposed by the bill 7176 will most likely not be able to save the Supervisory Board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to this!
People's Deputy, the author of the bill Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in his support.
In particular, he notes: “many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation” and therefore “it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information”.
For starters, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned defense companies that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state-owned defense companies.
But even in Ukroboronprom, in accordance with the legislation, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-free basis.
All full power in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the General Director, who, incidentally, will make a decision on the need to relocate a particular enterprise of the defense industry, which is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not withstand criticism because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned defense companies.
Mr. Dmitry on his Facebook page also cites arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state-owned companies and state banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respected foreign experts at the very first word" war ", still in 2021 leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in the state-owned enterprises of Ukraine.
First, it is manipulation – most of such members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they “leave Ukraine”, to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
It should also be remembered that membership of the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
They are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt of deputies to remove foreigners from the supervisory boards, and the war is only a new opportunity.
Hello. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in the family. I have 2 children with me.

In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts of Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, will introduce an increased curfew for 2 days.
In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew was increased!
On the territory of these cities and villages, the restrictions will be in force from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the oblast, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can go outside only during the alarm to go to shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression – to clear and demine territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

The Serbian defense budget grew exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the upgrade of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took the predictions of a possible escalation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

UK Wants to Evict All Russians From Their Territory With All Property Confiscation!
Hello, you have a toy box
I traveled a lot in the city by car.
I’m not very good at names.
That’s okay, because my thoughts were completely different.
I’m a lot more relaxed now than when I first came here.
How are you feeling?
Fake information was distributed in social networks about military-obligation students, preparations for the evacuation of the military-industrial complex and the vacancy of places in dormitories.
Art helps to distract and switch
I understand that as a volunteer and just a good person, you want to sincerely help and support us.
And I understand that you need a photo, that you help and so on...
But, understand me. I lived well in Ukraine, I did not need any help.
And I don't want any of my acquaintances to see this and so on. Understand me correctly <0xE2><0x98><0xBA><0xEF><0xB8><0x8F>.
Can I ask a question?
Do you know what life is like for those girls who left you?
Did they want to come back to you?
Did they create a new relationship?
But are they happy?
Hey, how are you? What did you do today?
I made two Pfizer vaccines in Kyiv
I have a certificate, but the other day ended its action, and I think you need a booster dose?
If it is not difficult, can you find out the details from the doctor?
I have a weekend on Sunday. We often went to Kharkiv , it was beautiful there
I hope all goes well (and we believe in our housing issue)
Also today one man has to call back and say if he found something for me

I don't think I can do it without you tomorrow.
I've been wanting to ask for a long time and forget everything.
What about the COVID vaccines?
I did not have time at home to make a booster (third dose) of the vaccine. Is this vaccination paid?
I'll be waiting for you to call. Is there anything I can take with me?
It's good that you've already arrived and thank you so much for a nice evening.
I will print a new ticket and you can go to the hall

The forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians aged 27 and 28, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling system near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Svoboda", human rights center "Viasna", the head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the support of the special forces "SOBR" were detained three residents of Bobruisk, one was wounded.
According to "Viasna", during the detention, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railways of the Republic of Belarus will be severely stopped" by the security forces with the use of weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of "BZhD" and the administrator of thematic resources of "BZhD" in "VKontakte" and "Odnoklassniki" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, reported <0x40>belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
The formation of BYpol, declared by the Lukashenko regime to be extremist, continues to call on the Belarusians to carry out sabotage at the railway transport and infrastructure facilities of Belarus within the framework of the "Victory" plan.
Belarusian “rail guerrillas” are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is transferring to fight, to Ukraine a living force and equipment.
This is for raising self-esteem.
Do you like to read books?
And in the phone mode they do not work on Easter holidays too?
Is it possible to do this on the phone any day or not?
Even a separate law was passed on this issue
We've been here for four days, it's just a nightmare, not a road.
We drove through the Kiev region, the city of Irpin, then there was horror, shooting, sirens.
I worry about them too.
Sylvia, Masha hasn't received the money from Kletsana yet, can I call them?
Yeah, I'll tell them, I think they'll be home.
There are different Muslims. There are fanatics, and there are really believers.
The meaning of jihad is interpreted differently by different Muslims.
But to be honest, I'm very uncomfortable doing this for money.
You have done me so much good.
I can do it for free.
Temporarily for the period we are looking for a university, then of course you will need permanent residence
but maybe she will have a dorm. (looking for Prague, Brno, and other places)
We are now nedelaeko from Prague, we have a car, we are ready to pay partly for accommodation.
The town or village does not matter, it is desirable that it was a separate accommodation.
I stumbled into the waterphone and connected two unnecessary shares for which I withdrew money and I can not turn them off
And then I took the money out of a card that wasn't there.
I don’t know why the money was withdrawn.
The cost of the repair is paid by the owner = Mr. Dedina. He is due to appear on Tuesday.
Be home on Tuesday and wait for the repairmen.
Can I ask you for a cigarette?
Can we change the mobile tariff if you have time? Is it too late?
US bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin’s daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, Russia’s largest banks, Alpha Bank and Sberbank, and is also banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in the message on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is Russia’s largest government-owned financial institution, and Alfa-Bank is Russia’s largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
“This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law firms and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States were restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This would prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with these organizations and freeze any of their assets under U.S. jurisdiction.
A detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin’s adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including ex-President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they hold in the United States.
Will be able to get only to this place, then the passage is closed and I will come to you
Vera, can we wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant of SkyUp, my mother is a seamstress of industrial products, my son Makarchik went to kindergarten.
We lived well, but did not even think that we would be forced to flee, because to hide in the cellar is no longer the strength.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
Therefore, we hope that for the first time someone will shelter us) We can even pay for a room or apartment, but if it will be in our pocket.
Cleanliness and order are guaranteed.
We do not have bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help at such a difficult time for us.
I had one English lecture in the afternoon, and then I went to work in the nursery.
I explained to Margarita how to fill in all the documents.
I hope she understands and does it well.

I'll meet you on Thursday and I'll tell you.
All is well.
How often do you clean?
I clean every week.
I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher.
My girlfriends can't move anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you hear about housing information, you will let me know.
I'd love to rent a place with some decent girl.
If you can know this, let me know.
On my part, I won’t let you down.
Thank you in advance.

We'll do it somehow.
But as it will be paid, please no loans.
Write to me directly and I will help you.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Do you have to take the clothes you gave me?

Something's come from you, I don't see it.
I am also very sad.
I'll remind you of the invoice later.
Is your father the only one who speaks and understands Russian?
What day does a colleague want to do house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can not but share with you. There is a news from Mariupol for my son - alive and in line.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he is scientifically conducting research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new connection neurons
The journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna released in the morning of April 12 a video, which was handed over to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they have no weapons left to take part in the battle, and the woe of the wounded.
They said, "The bill goes for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Marine Brigade, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not communicate with the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valery Zaluzhny, assured that the command's communication with the defense forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to Azov leader Andrei Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by Azov regiment fighters.
Thank you, I will adjust to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same until we stay here.
2 hours drive )) walks, mom shopping and back)!
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she was doing here.
A squadron of Czech drones has started flying over Ukraine since today.
Nearly 50 professional drones will be used to detect and some will be used to directly destroy an enemy drone.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech “birds” brothers were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of Mukachevo City Council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, however, their intermountain friends, headed by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered the drones to their destination: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where fighting is currently ongoing.
In order to use copters as efficiently and safely as possible, the location of their deployment will now be kept a secret.
Four friends who are helping the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say: in the coming days they will send many more interesting “gifts” to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
No worries, everything is fine. I love sweet, but I can do without it
I'm worried we won't make it.
Soon I will be back in Ukraine, continue to work
Okay. If it's okay, I'll agree.
I will try to do it myself, but if there are problems I will write to you, if you can?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the old lady in the village in Yiviv,she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there is no housing
Maybe she'll be happy and cheer her up.
My phone was repaired today.
I think I’m freezing out on the street today.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, drop me the music you like.
I wonder what kind of music you have in mind.
Mom and Dad have to listen.
You'll find it somewhere near your little brother's wheelchair.
Today it was cooler and raining. Tomorrow should be warm.
But no pity for destroyed houses, pity for people who are abused by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya street.
Details: It is noted that unknown people tore the flag of the European Union, crushed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They carried the flag.
Good morning, thank you to the children for the carol, we do not have such a custom, so we did not know, we gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to be given
In Czech there is someone to talk to, if anything.
'Cause I'm living in a dormhouse. Twelve o'clock, there'll be people here, and then they'll go to work.
Hello is a little better.
I was already in the yard today.
Even today I slept there.
We have already made great progress.
I'll definitely bring the dumplings another time!
I don’t have the strength to do them today.
Since I push away from the days and times when there is work to clean the apartments after the guests, I can say about April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning the apartments.
By May month - I can say approximately in late April or early May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, sorry I didn't write back for a long time cooked dinner and slept a little
If you don't mind, could I come today?
We will see you after your arrival.
He is modest, recently learns a lot. I realized that it is very necessary for him in life
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the economics department of the highland.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grishko in the nursery behaved well.
On Monday I have to bring confirmation of employment and cash payment for the nursery.
I've been lazy since Friday
I don't do anything except a lot of them and sleep a lot of sleep (and I drink a lot of water)
If I go to the doctor tomorrow, I will go with you.
I need to get another analysis.
So you don’t have to go again.
The drain tank works very poorly, it flushes poorly. Needs a master. Needs to be fixed.
So there is enough of everything
Can you send me the correct email address?
I would like to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you enrolled in.
Do you feed the children there or do you have to bring them with you?
And now for a moment I can come to you there is one question
If you still need help, write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn’t really want you to raise money from the start so people wouldn’t think we were speculating on this!
But two items were not enough for me to fill in online:
I will go to bed to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night
It's a great idea. Now I'll watch the video. It'll be good because the whole family will be drawing.
Karazin University urges employees and students to carefully check any information, do not trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army
She has collected several works for portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet should be held.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How do I get credited for the day that I was not at work?
Headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against a neighboring state”.
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for actions in the Slobozhansk direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being trained at the permanent station of the 60th Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of personnel units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, the recruitment of soldiers from the said brigade is carried out.
The enemy experiences a special problem when completing the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities, will continue to strike at transport infrastructure objects on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying them or disabling them.
Determined units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansk direction, certain units of the 6th Combined Arms Army and the coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue the partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
Air reconnaissance of the area continues in the Izyum direction in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
By forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to make an offensive in the direction of the settlements of Dovhenke and Dmitrovka, was unsuccessful and retreated to the previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhny and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault operations in the area of Zolote, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue their assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of separate units the enemy carried out artillery shelling of positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopillya, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, defenders of Ukraine repulsed four enemy attacks over the past 24 hours, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Did you not understand your thoughts?
We will try to make it, but I doubt it.
How can you want to sleep and I'm keeping you
Are you sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, then tell me, I'll understand everything)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home, especially 1+1. We do not need to adjust :)
I turn on the TV here solely in order to listen to the Czech language
I have a monthly package expiring today :)
Can we do this today on the phone?
Buy embroidery fabric, canvas, thread for embroidery
I understand, then I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
We'll meet my dad later, be sure to do it again.
I read the ad on facebook ,it probably Google wrote something in its own way <0xD0><0xB4><0xD0><0xB5><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB2><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xBB><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB0><0xD1><0x8E><0xD1><0x89><0xD0><0xB5><0xEF><0xB8><0x8F>. , I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we've got the things you brought, but are there any small things you can bring in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about the job.
If the director is happy, I can start going to work next week because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the labor office to submit documents (if it works, because there are very large queues) and on Saturday it rains :)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream of working on Teva
Friends are old and not very, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and in mind.
Now you too have hard times.
Over the past month, I have spoken to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has been turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilt and shame over your country’s actions towards your neighbors.
Because of what Ukraine is subjected to on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been under threat, and you were preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very long-time friend from Memorial.
I’ll tell you a little later, – as usual, Sasha answered laconically. – Now after the search we walk on the ruins.
Others – cultural figures, artists, critics, writers – are struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be honest: with the exception of very few of you – those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Medusa, Navalny’s organization and a number of other places – did many of you do anything to resist this regime?
Except for participating in rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also: Russian journalist's column "Too late to hide, too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is going on around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which must now have weighed heavily on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you had some degree of freedom and democracy – disorderly, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of confusion that you seek salvation behind the back of a tsar, even if his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer to be around him. Why is that?
In fact, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and releasing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took your soul away from the Dzerzhinsky monument – and allowed the KGB to lay down, renew, reshape and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with the choice between plundering the country and returning the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly accepted the plunder.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and it marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then there was Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still voted for it, or chose not to vote at all.
When he started leveling Chechnya again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping the victims of Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation”, and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar Yurta, Itum Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I returned to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: about the torture of civilians, about the children killed, about the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me, "Brad, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.”
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise in the middle of zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to cross his fingers that part of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have become well-earned, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices are up, but is that a problem?
Moscow festively shone and shone with chic.
When several opposition figures were killed – Yuri Shchekochikin, Anna Politkovskaya, Oleksandr Litvinenko and others – many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, the matter did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of president to Medvedev, and he took the place of prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When, after several months of Medvedev’s rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we hardly did much in the West, if at all.
A little resentment, a little sanctions; but what difference did it make that Russia was blatantly violating international law when there was such a great temptation for Russian oil, gas and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
After the 1990s, that was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin switched places with Medvedev again and took the presidential chair as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went out in mass protests.
The name of Navalny became a household name, you did not leave the streets for six months, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some people have huge deadlines.
"What could we have done?"
I have heard it so often and I still hear it.
“The state is so strong, and we are so weak.”
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Infuriated by a pro-Russian president who deceived their European hopes, they once seized Maidan – and never left it again.
They built a tent town on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with the help of sticks, rebars and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters moved on to the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose their leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general turmoil, he captured Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it was of little use.
How many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
I find it difficult to find the reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of my friends were mostly silent.
“We are not interested in politics,” he said.
And you hid the new one in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, like new ones after the restoration started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012 – with their binbegs, public WiFi and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and only getting better.
You have hardly paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIL or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticized it at the time in an interview because I didn’t seem to understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw the streets of Homs state snipers cold-blooded shooting at my children's peers.
Among all Russian citizens, only your soldiers visited, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Many of you are certainly familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemöller:
“First they came for the socialists, but I was silent – because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the members of the unions, but I remained silent – because I am not a member of the unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept silent – because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense.”
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done that.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some really speak now – like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osypov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new Gulag or forming a company with Navalny.
As for others, you know best what country you live in.
So, I’m sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians – or, as seems very likely, if he doesn’t succeed, he’ll take over for you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly alone went out to protest and still held a small time, but soon will get a more serious.
For the thousands of you who signed petitions, who disagreed on social media (even if only a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for a joke, are not in the distant past – and now they, with great probability, are waiting for you in the future.
Who then shall speak for you? Who shall remain?
The example of the Ukrainians – even more so than in 2014 – scares the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that intelligence, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing his superiority on paper.
Given everything, few people in Russia are aware of this, as well as the fact that the war is still going on.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know where this is going.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just hoops, your laws, apart from the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights remain.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And, if you don’t give him what he wants, you can either try to go somehow, or you will be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there is one more.
Which will eventually overthrow the regime.
And, perhaps, in the current conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: because of the economic collapse imminent on Russia, it is most likely to light up in the province, in small towns.
When prices rise and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it has periodically happened, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool – the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be set up almost under any circumstances.
Navalny’s organization was defeated, but it is possible to create others, more informal, more decentralized.
You are many, you are millions.
Moscow police can cope with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps with a hundred thousand.
If she gets over 300,000, she'll be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After all that he forced them to do in Ukraine, all that he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
If I were you, I’d be scared too.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but really try to get it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat – and be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet – and be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake – and die in a raw cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years – and will only intensify further, becoming more and more widespread.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it's going to end.
Act cold-blooded, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told we could come on Monday.
We'll be home tonight.

In my personal life, I am sociable, but I take the issues of marriage seriously.

But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalie's game room today to say hello.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the kids were going home, one mother refused to take the baby because she said that she came to look at things and put them in that room with the clothes and Mr. Valery opened our nursery to her yesterday until 7:00 p.m.
Could this really be the case?
