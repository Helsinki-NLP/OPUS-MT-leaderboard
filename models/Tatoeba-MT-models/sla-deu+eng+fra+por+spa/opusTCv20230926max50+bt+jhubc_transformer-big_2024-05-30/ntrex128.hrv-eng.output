Welsh MPs worried they will "look like Muppets"
Some Assembly Members (AM) were shocked by the proposal that they could be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) in the future.
This was due to the plans to rename the Parliament of Wales.
Members of parliament from all political spectrums are concerned that they may become the object of ridicule.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that the name "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means shit.
Plaid Cymru, a parliamentary member of the Wales Party, said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative solutions.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was “open” to name change, but that the MWP in speech could quickly turn into a Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary committee that is currently preparing the law for the introduction of the name change announced the following: "Of course, the final decision on how parliamentary deputies will be titled will be made by themselves."
A 2017 law by the Welsh government gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that found broad support for changing the name of the Parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the name of MEPs in the Parliament, the Committee favored the term "members of the Welsh Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
MEPs are proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach a consensus could bring headaches to House Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on changes within weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the way the parliament functions, including rules on disqualification of parliamentarians and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, parliamentary deputies will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a violation of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the initiation of the process of its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of a plebiscite to change the name, said he would not recognize the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's died as the churches in Harlem struggled to survive
“The older people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
“Today there is no one else.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are socializing in a different way today," he said.
“Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly stay.”
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and “sooner or later it will be found again at the beginning.”
He added that the churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people will live who will not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore the day will come sooner when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that residents who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis—the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation emigrated in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation, which held worship services nearby, took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson who also led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of poor people.”
The expert who played at the carillon in July used another name: "cultural treasure" and "indispensable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing at a larger carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors of construction works, some of which were brought by lay leaders of the church, and others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the parish’s governing body made up of laypersons, wrote to the diocese in July out of concern that the diocese would “try to shift costs” to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old shark injured while diving for lobsters in California
According to an official statement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then rowed with the group to the site of the attack to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of the lobster caught, but then he realized that he was yelling "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone was torn.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to her upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure swimmers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is becoming a competitor to chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing department store-style cosmetic counters and hiring specialized retailers.
As part of the UK’s massive <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn entry into the beauty market, which continues to grow in parallel with the decline in sales in the clothing and home furnishings market, larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if they prove successful.
Investing in cosmetics is one way supermarkets seek to harness the shelf space that was once provided for televisions, microwaves, and home furnishings.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
And the existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for specific brands similar to stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique decorative cosmetics, so most of the products will be suitable for vegans, and this is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
Fragrance Shop will also test concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and returning to everyday shopping for small amounts of food at local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s CEO, said the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain seeks to resist low-cost stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's introduced Argos outlets to hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments, as it bought both chains two years ago, which it claims has spurred the sale of groceries and made those acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by a supermarket to refresh its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended in a quarrel over the distribution of pharmacy income in his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business in 281 stores to the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
He says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by including a range of luxury skincare products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide a more comfortable environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training of colleagues who will be at hand with customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for the purchase of cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones is "rave" after Holly Willoughby quits her <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract
Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones left to “boil with rage” after TV host Holly Willoughby dropped her <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with his brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their brand of home apparel and Truly accessories.
Their brand has been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The show's host, This Morning, 37, has announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones to cook in anger by pulling out of a lucrative joint venture at the last minute to focus on her own new great deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when the TV's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting at his business empire's Marlowe, Buckinghamshire headquarters on Tuesday that her new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m meant there was no more time to devote to their Truly homewear and accessories brand.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was supposed to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to resign shocked everyone involved in the job.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to launching the entire line.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cause the company to suffer millions of losses due to the large investments made in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothes, and the possible additional delay in launching the line.
This could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as CEO in March.
The couple spend their vacations together, and Jones holds a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We don’t want to comment on his business activities.”
It was a tough negotiation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the newspapers for comments that some might consider “unworthy of the president” and for having such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump make so many concessions?”
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
“I didn’t make any concessions.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have failed.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North had not noticed the “appropriate reaction” of the United States to North Korea’s disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the US has still not lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We are in danger of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results — halting test missile launches, helping to free hostages, and bringing the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting to enter in front of this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not asking for international assistance, so all this is a bit problematic," Ms Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disasters Office, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to get involved in aid efforts.
Given the constant shaking of the soil in Indonesia, this country is still sadly unprepared to cope with the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, this is not something that is common on other parts of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And in the best time to travel between the many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is on its way to Palo, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of another disaster.
Improving Indonesia’s decayed structure was the cornerstone of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Yoko is struggling with a lack of financial resources, and next year new elections are being held.
Yoko also faces pressure from remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored a tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea on Saturday with a 89th minute goal at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal on a 1–0 score for Chelsea.
He moved the ball to his left foot before kicking it to the opposing tripod.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepa Arrizabalaja who jumped towards it and entered the net.
"It was challenging to get to that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half-time after scoring Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the ball back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> during that match before he turned around somewhere in the middle of the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
He then threw a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and with his left foot hit the ball into the net on the opposite tripod next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool play a club match against Napoli in the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will welcome the Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the quake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference that a large number of people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings after a 7.5-magnitude quake was felt on Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with the remains of demolished buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and the 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called in people from the area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still underway, but I would like to be contacted by anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the scene who believe they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said a process of informing the victim's closest relatives is underway.
A taxi driver living on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would take several hours before they could return to their homes.
The officer reportedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's so terrible."
At 14:00 in the fenced area there were two police vans, and another was parked just outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and monitored the block of flats.
Anyone with any information was asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, citing Minutes 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell Statue in Parliament is the latest monument to be found amid a debate about "the end of history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for the near-Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell’s society called Mr. Crick’s attempt a “foolishness” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate currently underway regarding the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of Westminster Palace would become the subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars is not something Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful revival of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the thinking of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a person who is still considered by many to be worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure.
Whether this is a completely credible opinion is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as a patron lord are still worthy of honor and commemoration."
Pig Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man with only the surname "Yuan" was found dead with cut arteries and covered in blood near a barn at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pigsty on 30 May 2005 in Xinging, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at a market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door to the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that a 250-pound pig bit the breeder to death.
Guiyang's evening news reports that a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and crippled."
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Vecernje Novosti that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market management are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, attacks of pigs on humans have already been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and the husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had pinned a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just need to show them respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa Bring Heavy Rain to Southwestern U.S.
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and southwestern the United States.
At 5:00 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa was blowing at 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is forming over the Pacific and moving towards the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture, in interaction with the approaching low-pressure area, will cause heavy precipitation in much of the southwest.
In local areas 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous torrential flooding, mudslides and possible desert landslides.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause rainfall of approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Fluorescent floods are possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not advisable to go to the desert on foot because of the risk of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into wild rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local storm winds and dust storms.
Approaching low-pressure areas will bring local heavy rains to parts of the southern California coast.
Precipitations of more than 12 mm are possible, which can cause less muddy torrents and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the wet season in this region.
Scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning before covering a wider area at the end of the day on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread on Tuesday to the area where the borders of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah touch and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, large temperature changes across the U.S. are possible as the Arctic cools, but the tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of the dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the residual summer heat will continue to grow and spread again.
In most of the central and eastern U.S., the beginning of October is expected to be warm with 27 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the tense testimony of Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, on Thursday on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political clash continued, with reporters interrupting a regular program to inform of a last-minute turnaround on Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her while drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his ardent testimony, stated that he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
The hearing on Friday was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number cited in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The number of viewers for other networks broadcasting the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the number of people watching content in offices.
To give you a better idea, we are talking about an audience that is similar in number to the one watching the playoffs of American football or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in the drama that unfolded on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning filmed him being yelled at by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to the Justice Committee hearing.
For a few minutes, he stood with his eyes down as he was in front of CNN's live cameras, where protesters lashed out at him with insults.
"I'm standing here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him, "You have the power while so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office issued a statement even before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the board hearing.
Hours later, all cable and television networks were watching live when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on sending Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidates over the next week, as demanded by Democrats who are in the minority.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talks with Coons, and then several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign secretary, in another interview in the same issue with her on the cover continued to criticize her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying the proposal that the UK and the EU should levy customs duties on each other is “complete nonsense”.
The murder of Wayde Sims: police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of the death of a LSU player
Police have arrested the suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and detained on negligent homicide charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the clash.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, according to the WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
A $350,000 bail was sought.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office on Friday released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police department thanked the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and the area's citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for "perseverance and the search for truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash into Mexico City
The ash ejected by the Popocatapetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano after heightened activity in the crater and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center was followed by multiple rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity of the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflict between police and Catalan separatists marks anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police and thousands of people joined anti-demonstrations to mark Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists thwarted by police began to throw eggs and powder paint at police officers, creating dark dust clouds in streets that would otherwise have been flooded with tourists.
Fighting broke out later in the day when police used batons to calm the fight.
Over the course of several hours, groups advocating independence chanted "No forgetting, no forgiving", while unionists shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, the local press said.
Tensions in the independence-seeking region have not subsided a year after a referendum on 1 October declared illegal by Madrid and celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The vast majority of voters opted for independence, although the turnout was small as those opposed to secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent the night in the streets Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations continued, but the protesters were forced to take a different route.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia will gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy that they were able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a crucial, though narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year as their best-known leaders are in self-imposed exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to record demonstrations in support of police, said the clash was sparked by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who had announced to an investigative prisoner since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way we can announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after crashing his car into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after crashing into a Londonderry house on multiple occasions.
The incident took place around 7:30 p.m. on Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the yard door and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point a crossbow arrow was fired at the car.
Menge's goal brought Livingston a victory over the Rangers with a score of 1:0
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston
The new Scottish Premier League team Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his only second defeat in 18 games at the club's head from Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Menge's goal proved decisive as Gary Holt's team aligned with the Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team is still without a away win in the Premier League this season, and next Saturday they play against the Hearts, the leading club in the league, behind with eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday as part of the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt still hasn't suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed an opportunity against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they scored that goal, as their directness in the attack caused a whole range of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way, but was too slow on the way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after slipping to intercept Craig Halkett's head shot towards the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties to the guests
That's how the key goal was scored.
The Rangers failed to stop the free kick, and Livingston conceived the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisting Mengi in the midfield.
Until that point, the Rangers mostly had control of the ball, but faced impenetrable home defenses, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the shot.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's legs stood in the way of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow struck a wide blow from another organized attack by Livingston.
Long passes failed to cross the Livingston goal line, and two elevens were not awarded – after Halkett’s clash with substitute Glen Middleton and one for playing hand-to-hand.
“Great” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from the Scottish BBC in Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent game and the result of Livingston.
All of them were excellent, thus continuing to exceed expectations on this entry path.
Their playing style and staff have barely changed since their return to the big clubs, but great credit goes to Holt and the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at leading an excellently organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to take a break during the entire game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards set by a good game under Gerrard.
They did not manage to dress the ball to the end. They only once opened a hole in the home team and this is a kind of a call to pick up for the Rangers who are in the middle of the rankings.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), everything was full of smiles in the open when the leader of Tours and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – aimed at repairing ties between NATO allies.
They diverged on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
It is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters of the president showed up nearby to see him.
And hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – have raised their voices in condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the divisiveness caused by a visitor who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and attacked as an autocrat by others.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The collision occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed after a collision and a driver escaped from the scene of an accident on Chiders Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's crash site.
The city police said police officers were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
As a result of the accident, roads have been closed and bus traffic has been diverted, and motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in riots in a male prison of the imprisoned type.
The riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special Tornado troops were brought in to contain the unrest involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers at the scene were provided with assistance for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been engaged to handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members received help for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and that they will be able to spend a long time behind bars.”
The Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager ended up in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, emergency police were summoned to prison to deal with a serious situation in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with torrential flooding (possible benefit for arid areas)
Tropical depression is rare in Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa sweeps through the Desert Southwest with its remaining force, bringing the risk of torrent flooding.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in areas from western Arizona, through southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is scheduled to approach Phoenix late Monday in the rain and cross it straight on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or depression within a 320-kilometer radius of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, there is a probability of precipitation from 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated totals of up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger of torrent flooding, Rosa could come as a rescue as the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a great danger, some of these precipitations could be useful because of the current drought in the southwest.
“According to a U.S. map of arid areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is affected by at least extreme drought, the second highest category,” the report said.
The hurricane's trajectory first approached the coast along Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific and therefore weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to approach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening by the force of a tropical storm.
Rains in parts of Mexico could be severe and pose a significant flood risk.
"The amount of total rainfall expected in the area from the Baja California Peninsula to northwest Sonora is from 75 to 150 mm, a possible maximum of 250 mm," weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main dangers expected from Rose or her remains are very heavy rains on the Baja California Peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the US Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening torrential flooding and mudslides in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset with stab wounds.
Around 4 a.m. BST on Saturday, an injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
The Avon and Somerset Police Department said the 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police called for anyone with footage of the incident to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered the anger and anger of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s cruel and shameful tactics,” Trump said at an election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered the malice and anger” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and resolutely and emotionally dismissed accusations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing on the charge she made.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable public service career,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republicans running in the midterms.
“Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I am,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “create resistance and obstruction.”
An aide to the Republican leadership told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and numbers continue to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were dragged away by huge waves that hit the coast when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when twilight waves up to six meters high hit the shore, dragging many of them to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run and were killed,” said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB disaster mitigation agency, at a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses with it, it hit everyone on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived,” he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent strikes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was equivalent to 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of a long and narrow bay may have increased the power of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were trapped under the rubble of the buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of casualties and damage may be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala and closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"Communications have been completely cut off and we have no information from Donggala."
"There are more than 300,000 people living in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers had traveled to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms for failing to provide information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials say the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard panickingly warning people down the street about an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed onto the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The quake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The military said it had begun sending relief cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still needed food and other essential supplies.
The city's airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The Indonesian tsunami killed more than 800 people.
The situation is extremely bad.
“Although World Vision staff from Donggala successfully arrived in the city of Palu, where the employees were sheltered in tarpaulin tents set up in the backyard of their office, they forwarded scenes of destruction along the way,” Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a number of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
While humanitarian groups have set in motion aid wheels in the disaster, some have complained that foreign aid workers with great expertise have been prevented from coming to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supply and hiring of personnel from other countries can only begin if the place of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster,’ we can receive international aid, but such a situation has not yet been declared.”
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday fell on Palu, friends and families of those still considered missing still hoped that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigate black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewers.
On Saturday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his students.
“Given the many years I’ve spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, which had spread to the paragliding community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray tick instead of two blue ticks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling ATMs in Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee filling an ATM machine in downtown Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, the Newport Police Department said in a statement.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver of the car was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with it, another man “came into the race behind Brink’s back” and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in an ATM.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene of the theft, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday announcing the change, he wrote: "A living entity officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
The show's authors said he replaced singer Ariana Grande in the show, which was cancelled due to "emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously stated that the word had a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year in a conversation about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, that’s us.
It started with Kanya, which means ‘the only one’, in Ye alone – it is a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West’s former associate, Jay-Z, played with versions of his name without a dash and with a dash and in capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against its citizens
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would “never use the military against the Mexican people.”
Military units fired during peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as left-wing student movements began to spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
“As China becomes increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in research in this area,” said Kai Fu Lee, an artificial intelligence investor and expert who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
That comment came after various parts of the U.S. government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the U.S. generally lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to become the first country in the number of AI innovations by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next major discovery in artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
“Doubling the investment could double the chances of the next major AI achievement coming to the U.S.,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book, “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order,” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American gamer Othello, and later served as director of Microsoft’s research department and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, the Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would take place to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government scholarships.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders, it’s taking away corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on artificial intelligence research in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council published the Plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academia similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that wanted to set up the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Saturday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that could resolve a dispute with Greece that has been going on for decades and that has blocked Greece's opening of accession talks to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia, and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents the assertion of its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on a proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a campaign to boycott the vote cast doubt on whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU while accepting the deal with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries created after the breakup of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgievska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko joined a referendum on 30 September 2018 in Strumica on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and moved chairs in front of tents set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will support the referendum, since more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said a "positive" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will vote in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
The second poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57% of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
Look: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire defense of Brighton to score a goal
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defense at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, winning 2-0 for Manchester City.
Aguero made the victory insanely easy, scoring a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton defense players and then landed on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four opponents in green shirts.
He bypassed one of the defenders and then overtook several more at the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he passed the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero, who threw the right-handed football into the right-hand side of the net and defeated Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were going to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re very happy that he scored at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an initial lead in the Premier League clash.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's court during that game.
He made a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane along his left flank.
Sane pushed the ball several times before guiding Sterling to the tripod.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net just before slipping into the car.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in a group game of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to stop Rockies from advancing
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from the playoffs, there was not much reason to insist on a new start.
But always competitive, Scherzer hopes to win Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have an advantage of one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, make it to the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a spot in the wild-card playoffs on Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but still hope to win their first title.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, we can at least pitch knowing what the atmosphere is like here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level that I would witness this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a Sunday starter, but are reportedly inclined to offer Scherzer to play in that case.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitching area on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The Washington-based right-hander scored 18:7 this season, an average of 2.53 runs and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds shifts.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of Republican voter turnout in the general election, the president bluntly commented on his choice of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court Justice.
“Everything we did will be put to the test in November.
It's five weeks before one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are some of the big ones, the big ones – I didn’t run, but I’m actually in the race and that’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
“You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see that’s happening right now.
Their intention is to regain power in any way; you see malice, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over in order to take power and control; that's why they want power and control. We won't give it to them."
Democrats, he says, have a mission to “resist and interfere.”
“You’ve seen that over the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, evil, corrupt and liars.”
He named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee by her name, prompting a loud outcry from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document - it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer holds different views.
Does not tolerate the expression of personal opinions
I was not too surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last in a row of Labour MPs who have been told that they are not welcome – all because we have said what is on our minds.
According to my lawmaker, Joan Ryan, she acted in a similar way because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the censorship proposal for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
Announcing the Nottingham East Labour branch meeting on Friday, it said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years that I worked as a local Labour MP, the General Council meetings on Friday nights were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, these days many meetings take a different tone, and the promise of a “kinder, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment ever began.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as associates who I thought shared similar political views began to demand a drastic change of mind and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with – whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I address the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a torrent of insulting words on social media calling for my impeachment, renouncing the center’s policies and telling me that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist comments every day, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me the most was the toleration of offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every proposal of mistrust or change of election rules we become more and more narrow-minded party.
Many times in the last two years I have been advised to bow my head, not to be so loud, and told that everything would be all right then.”
But that’s not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, driven by the neglect of Margaret Thatcher’s government that has left my school’s multi-purpose classroom to decay, I have wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or minister in government.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East Branch could be misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is grabbing a Brexit that will negatively affect households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituencies, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political advantage will deter me from acting in the way that I believe is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38:17 undefeated Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have affected the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership League.
Now they have reached the top of the rankings and are the only undefeated of the ten teams.
Ultimately, the top defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested at every game so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said: "Everything goes to Ayra, they took advantage of the opportunity better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute by Frazier Climo brought Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to raise the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by 11 points before scoring a goal in the half-time and making an independent attempt to change the result for Ayr at 17: 5 on the eve of the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggott realized, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long pause due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried away on a stretcher, and when the game resumed, Ayr continued the good game with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was realized by Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again forced the extra player to pay, with an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Clima who did not have the ball; from the penalty kick line, MacPherson performed a laying behind Ayr in full swing penetration.
Climo realized, as he had done almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent sideman Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth attempt.
The star of the Still Game series seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in the service industries after it was revealed that he was appointed director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favorite series, which he is a screenwriter and one of the stars, along with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last to air, and Kiernan appears to be planning to dedicate his life to the aftermath of Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although one source for the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in "a growing restaurant business in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will grant it access to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are patrolling a naval center full of cranes in La Paz.
The flag of the color of the ocean is displayed on public buildings.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are nicknamed: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to return it.”
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the lost coastline in favor of Chile during the 19th-century resource conflict is still alive – just as is the longing for re-navigation of the Pacific Ocean.
As Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling expected on October 1, after a five-year trial, those hopes are perhaps at their highest level in decades.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course is optimistic about the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Multitudes of Bolivians across the country will watch the International Court of Justice’s ruling on big screens and hope that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday's verdict.
"We are close to returning the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia’s favor and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final hearings, meaning the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia’s interests, the last four years may have been backwards.
"The issue of access to the sea has been appropriated by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has buried Chile's goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will resume dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with the court's unusually fast decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia an "unusual opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "break 139 years of disagreement for the mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s favorite presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never disarm if they could not trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the meeting of the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
The comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said the sanctions had been prolonged because of "vain fantasies" and that the U.S. opposition to the declaration on the end of the Korean War would by no means bring the North to its knees.
Washington is unwilling to back the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s serious intention to give up its arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal That The Last Line Of Big Headwear Is On The Way To A Luxury Store In Your Neighborhood
Whether you want to upgrade your hat collection or completely cover the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the catwalk presented a line of crazy huge headgear for their spring and summer 2019 collection and delighted style lovers at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention on the runway.
The specimen that stood out was designed by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide rim resembling feathers that completely "takes over" the heads of the model.
Other bulky accessories included jewelled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple, but these accessories were not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sutured lips and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than high fashion pieces.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a snorkel and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow the big fashion saying – luck is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge hats could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
Huge hats fit perfectly with the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a rim width of about 60 cm that has been seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the extremely impractical hat that conquered social networks sent another big creation to the catwalk – a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the swimsuit who wore it.
The extinguished orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was an exhibit in the Jacquemus' La Riviera summer collection for 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist of celebrities and celebrities, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury stores for next summer. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion accessories.”
John Edward: The Language Skills Citizens of the World Need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding exam scores, with individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities giving it extra weight.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the mentioned school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes to his heart.”
This statement is a powerful reminder that we cannot use English alone if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the highest scores in languages were achieved by participants of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received excellent grades.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students received an excellent grade for Mandarin, while 72% of students learning German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of students learning Spanish also received the highest possible grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as electives are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools as well as elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17% of employers are unable to fill jobs due to a shortage of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming an imperative for preparing young people for careers.
With more and more jobs demanding language skills, these skills are crucial in a globalised world.
Regardless of the choice of career, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will experience the benefits of such long-term skills.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with strangers, and this gives him an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 % of respondents in the UK do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate in it, and French is the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, namely 15 %.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, each school offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their curriculum, while others will opt for the languages that are considered to be most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, independent schools will always have a diverse selection, as well as teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools provide children with an environment in which learners can prepare and equip themselves with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for us.
One cannot ignore the fact that in today’s global business time, language skills are very important for the future of every country, so this must also be reflected in education.
Thus, the knowledge of modern languages should really be seen as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer language choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It's going to be fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will play in the Lakers' jersey for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans will soon welcome LeBron James' first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in his first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We don’t know how many minutes it will take.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the whole game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his plans for the six-game pre-season at the Lakers.
"At this stage of my career, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting his campaign with a series of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned meetings that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has yet to cast his vote for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming election as there is a risk that Republicans will lose a majority in Congress after a vote in November.
What time will Trump’s rally in West Virginia begin tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh that have sparked controversy over sexual abuse allegations. The Senate's affirmative decision has been pending for a week until the FBI investigation is completed.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain an edge for the November election.
Trump’s campaign headquarters said the five rallies scheduled for next week were aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“The majority in Congress is so important to the president’s plans that they will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter a tumultuous campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as the media from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News reported.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in a month, winning the state with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican senator Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve his ranking in polls,” Simon Haedar, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team left their hearts on the field before the individual skirmishes on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, a couple's skirmish on Sunday afternoon may be just what was meant to turn the Ryder Cup around.
"The wheel of fortune turns" is a saying that is especially true in sports and in which athletes believe, and especially in competitions like this.
Whom is the wheel of fortune now favoured?
“They had six points of advantage and now they have four. So I think luck is on our side right now,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are ahead with four points, with 12 points remaining until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in the back and encouragement with his game paired with Justin Thomas, with whom he scored three out of four points after a full day of play.
Spieth has played lethal from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
The cheering celebratory exclamations grew louder as Spieth and Thomas came two points behind, culminating in a crucial draw for Spieth.
The way he won the 15-hole game was followed by a similar cheering roar in which one can recognize the hope and belief that Americans can turn everything around.
“You just have to concentrate and think about your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
The European strange but irresistible pair has the maximum number of points and can not go wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who did not lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinari, show that they are exactly the players that need to be beaten on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over the Paris Le Golf National.
Maybe they'll both win at the same time in different holes.
Yet it is too early to speak of a victory for the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia, who had a great performance in the morning doubles game.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes on the pitch buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not dig.
However, on Sunday there will be no one to help individuals dig themselves out of their hole.
It’s fascinating to watch pair games up close because you can see the interactions of the pair players, hear the advice they give and those they don’t, as well as study a strategy that can change in an instant.
The Europeans have so far played better as a team, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this doubles game has also shown that the US team has the necessary combativeness, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europeans enter the last day of the Ryder Cup with a lead of 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday's doubles games on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant 10:6 advantage over the United States.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led by four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team in an effort to win the trophy that she missed at Hazeltine two years ago was superior to the American team in the morning games in doubles, achieving a result of 3 : 1.
The American team showed greater fighting ability in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already large.
To win the trophy, Jim Furyk’s team needs to collect eight points in 12 individual games on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", are only the second pair to score four points in doubles in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they proved superior in the game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau by a 5&4 win.
Woods, who did not perform best in two Saturday games, made some ingenious moves, but now has 19 defeats in 29 games in fourballs and doubles and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to return to the doubles with partner Henrik Stenson and experience a 2&1 defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world’s first and third best player.
But for Europeans, not everything was going smoothly on a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points on Sunday, setting the ranking high for their American team.
First they defeated the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter with a 2&1 score in fourballs, and then they defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team that was four points behind managed to return in individual games, although Furyk's team only needed a draw to keep the trophy.
After two days in lag, Sunday's counterattack seems to be hard on them.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase distrust of the United States and there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea last year took "significant goodwill measures" such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and deciding to halt the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
"If we don't trust the United States, we don't trust our national security. Under such circumstances, there's no way we're going to be the first to unilaterally disarm."
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “gradual” approach to denuclearization that would gradually lift sanctions on North Korea, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the incumbent U.S. and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work to “denuclearize the Korean peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea wants to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has conditioned Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons beforehand.
Washington has also ignored calls to cut tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on prior denuclearization and increases pressure through sanctions to force its goal, and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri added.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just a misconception by people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the US president spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
But he said Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held as many as three meetings in the past five months, adding: "If denuclearization had been sought by South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a standstill."
Regardless, the tone of Mr. Rio’s speech differed greatly from last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said targeting the continental U.S. with missiles was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim a “man rocket” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage to disarm, but added that there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no timetable for denuclearization, adding: "It doesn't matter if it lasts two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until complete, final and verified denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but was dubbed by North Korea after hours of "gangster demands."
North Korea has agreed to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex, which will happen if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” related to the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps toward stabilizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to learn how to get a good night’s rest
A new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to get a good night’s sleep in an attempt to combat an increasingly widespread culture of caffeine-filled learning and sleepless nights.
The academician found that students at the world’s best university often have no idea about the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep science professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has devised a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea of the course after giving a speech on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did I only learn this now, in my final year of college?"
She said no one told her how important sleep was, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help in academic and sports success and improve health in general.
Professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health service, Paul Barreira, said the university decided to introduce the course after students were observed to be severely sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive assignments.
One of these tasks involves a picture of a student dormitory where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how lack of sleep affects success, and how important a sleep routine is.
During the lectures, students also learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
After that, a campus map with interactive icons is displayed that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in night-long learning before exams still exists, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps in the fight against weight gain, because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it in a state of starvation and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar study course before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking up. They must be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin's goal defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after a hit by Dolly Menge knocked out Steven Gerrard's flawed defense and ended the match with a 1–0 win for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to score their first away win after a February 4–1 victory at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games, so his team now lags eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership behind the leading Hearts.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers seemed to be out of inspiration and did not seem to equalize the result.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third with only one goal difference behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after line referee Calum Spence sustained a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the flanks, making it past Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingstone line-up that took the Hearts last week and would have been delighted how his well-designed line-up suffocated any opponents' attempts.
The Rangers may have had more possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They had a chance to score as early as two minutes after Meng was kicked out of the game for the first time, which opened Scott Pittman the space to head towards the goal of Allan McGregor, however, the midfielder missed that opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an imprecise blow to the rear rows.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos must have thought that the referee should have given him an 11 in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson disregarded Colombian's request.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly's one head-hit by Lassana Coulibaly and Ovieo Ejaria's tame shot were not a big problem.
Although Livingston's 34-minute play-offs slowed the game, no one can deny their efforts.
The Rangers once again failed to take advantage of Jacobs's deep return ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and chose Menga for an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had an immediate effect as the wingman added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett delivering one long blow after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide cornering.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton was once again late looking for an eleven because he stumbled with Jacobs, but this time Thomson turned a blind eye.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Almanac on Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years and a few days ago...the day of the birth of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
The mainstay of science since that time, the Geiger counter has also become a mainstay of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Colorado" in which the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the main roles:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the atoms reacting to the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Look at that, it's true!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Bad Cells and Destroy Them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves extracting immune system cells from the patient and altering them in the laboratory
Cells are treated to be able to “recognize” a protein that is common to many cancers and are then re-injected into the patient
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer resolved for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting immune system cells from the patient, altering them in the laboratory to know how to “recognize” a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 promotes the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers," explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting cells of the immune system from the patient and their "learning" how to recognize cancer cells was successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after a guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, got involved in discussions about Trump and supported him, wearing a cap that read “Make America Great Again.”
Didn't go well.
Kanye West was whispered in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an intermittent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of an evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap that read “Make America Great Again,” he continued to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So often I talk to white people and they say to me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual abuse allegations.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he was accused behind the scenes of wearing a hat.
“I was attacked behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I've been bullied!
They said I sank," the Washington Examiner reported.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom?" and said that he would put on his Superman cape because that means I can't tell him what to do. You want the world to thrive?
Try it with love.”
Variety magazine wrote that his comments caused public outrage at least twice, and members of Saturday Night Live seemed embarrassed, while one person told the magazine: "The whole studio has been silenced."
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days earlier.
West's performance of "I love it", dressed like a bottle of Perrier mineral water, astounded many.
Westa was backed by Candace Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "One of the people with the most courageous spirit: THANK YOU FOR DEFENDING THE MAFIA."
Karen Hunter, the show’s host, tweeted that West was simply “his own and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes, or by supporting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “officially known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the deceased musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempting to kill a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Offences Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington slammed for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor leaned against the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such television roles often make boys feel they have to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, has admitted he wants to "very decisively" face the problem.
“Personally, I feel very determined at this point – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
"What did we teach men as they grew up, compared to the problem we now see?"
Keith believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on the screens, could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes boys feel they must have these particular traits of a man?
I think that’s actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
“Something went wrong for the boys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be filming the sequels to Game of Thrones after it ends next summer, and said he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in a new performance of Sam Shepard’s True West theatrical play, the story of the film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that he felt that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the filming of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife while filming this series, which gave me a family and a future life,” he said.
In the fantastic series that won the Emmy, Rose played the role of Ygritta, the love of Keith's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie’s property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities said there were almost no people infected with HIV in this way.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an ongoing problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Research estimates that due to conservative values in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to tackle the problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member gave information about GOP senators to the public, calling it “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
A Los Angeles Democrat says the claims are being spread by "ultra-right-wing" individuals, as well as websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The data reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was released by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address revealing the source of the disclosures belonged to MP Waters' office, as well as information about the MP's staff member, The Hill newspaper reported.
"These unsubstantiated allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations – is in no way responsible for the leakage of that information.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and absolutely false."
Ms Waters’ statement quickly attracted critics online, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He can't be defiant.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He needs to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to the criticism Democrats have made of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee running against Waters in the general election, also tweeted.
"That's important if it's true," he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office had informed "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies" of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are identified and that they bear the legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she said.
Review of the film "Johnny English: Back on Task" – not interesting enough Rowan Atkinson fights against spies
It is now common to look for messages about Brexit in every new British film, and it seems to be the case in the new film adaptation of the action series "Johnny English", whose first sequel, "Johnny English", was first released in 2003 and returned to the big screen in 2011 with the title "Johnny English Rides Again".
Will the twisted satire of how obviously worthless we are become the new national export opportunity?
The incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes peeled off and his rubber-faced face, once again has permission to complicate situations, while his name tells more than anything that it is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a freaking undercover agent who, despite his bizarre claims to "dilute" glamour, resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a touch of Mr. Bean's character and somewhat resembles the guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the 2012 London Opening Ceremony.
His character is also inspired by the traveler and mysterious world man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who is the epitome of chaos.
There are one or two good moments in this latest release of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually redundant, especially now that "serious" film titles like "007" and "Mission Impossible" offer elements of comedy themselves.
The humor seems to be intended for children, not adults. In my opinion, Johnny English’s crazy stories are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson’s silent gags embodied in the character of Mr. Bean.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now a generally accepted fact.
A hacker has entered Britain's most secretive spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an agent in office, who is unfortunately played by Kevin Eldon in a short appearance.
This spilled a glass of the prime minister’s patience, a haughty and warlike character who experiences a complete collapse of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson tries to faithfully portray the character who is supposed to represent Theresa May, but she doesn’t exactly get the material to do anything with.
Intelligence advisers reveal to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And that person will be the reckless Johnny English head and beard who is currently employed as the headmaster of some fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are a few handsome gags here because English teaches rocker-style espionage.
English is quickly taken to government offices for an emergency meeting, where he meets again with Bough, his former partner and eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the overly enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely wasted.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bullet, who is portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems, the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their thrilling journey with absurd and ridiculous events: disguised as waiters, they set off on a chic French restaurant, smuggling into Walt's luxury yacht, and English causes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality headphones to find out what the inside of Walt's house looks like.
Everything was done right for this last sequel, but no matter how attractive and glamorous the film is, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Pretty mediocre accomplishment.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I once again wondered if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would suit his talent?
Labour denies plans to make Britons work four days a week and get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week and be paid for five days of work.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on the savings generated by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to workers and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could "fit" into the party's economic agenda and plans to bow to the country's workers' interests.
The trade union congress supported switching to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not be achieved overnight, but it represents an aspiration that fits the approach this Party has towards balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this Party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to provide its support for such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this aspiration.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week’s Labour conference to elaborate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take power from the hands of "faceless directors" and "profit makers" in utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to regain their full stake because the Labour government could make "deductions" based on the perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to give 10 percent of the capital of private companies to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether the agency’s findings could affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a chance the FBI could discover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after you made these allegations, and asked, 'Did you do that?'
He was determined, unwavering, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seemed to be carved in stone.
“I’m determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and it really should have a strong accusation to change that,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has firmly denied everything,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she named could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only performances by stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of assignments or “actions” such as volunteering, sending e-mails to a world leader, making phone calls, or any other meaningful means of raising awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, given that it has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people that they are demanding a call to action, or just another case of so-called “clicism” – where people feel that signing an online petition or tweeting really makes a difference?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters striving to achieve a range of different goals.
He argues that these actions were an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its activities, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid out or raised.
The group estimates that the funds provided have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership between investors and implementers in the UK that advocates for "helping children develop to their full potential", with a promise to provide $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Foundation, to an audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the “The Power of Nutrition” project, which will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, which reads: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responds: “It’s going to be a long and difficult road <0xCC><0xB6> we’re going to fail sometime.
But we will succeed, as did the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.
The performances of Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the performances at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a “blockade” to prevent Russia’s energy exports
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's engagement in Syria is "especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government" as an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in that area as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he said.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of sea routes and blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event hosted by the non-profit Consumer Energy Alliance, which in the United States presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers”.
He compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are in fact the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as "using the same trick" in economies dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements came at the same time as the Trump administration’s intention to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “seriously consider” running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During an imminent meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for president herself.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the helm,” she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren voiced her opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying he was “guiding this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters don't think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Center for Policy Research, 58 percent of Massachusetts “probable” voters said a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent of the vote for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of Democrats discussed in connection with a potential 2020 presidential race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged for an incident of domestic violence that occurred on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through on his return, is comparable to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers are returning with,” she told audiences at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general issue that remains silent, and said of her son and other war veterans that “they come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the military, have given for this country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing reports of domestic violence and possession of a gun in an alcoholic state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support review of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties submitted a friendly report on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys who backed Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers come to the U.S., as countries facing ubiquitous gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Committee allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombia District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be dealt with on the basis of the concrete facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such an impediment violates this principle," a friend of the court said in the report.
Lawyers further argued that policies that deny entry to immigrants harmed the U.S. economy, arguing they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems <0xCC><0xB6> even all the serious problems <0xCC><0xB6> that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring in bodies every minute.
There is a shortage of clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-degree earthquake, were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulder, were resting in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors for continued severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of the sensation of a violent earthquake shaking a fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I was crushed inside the ruins of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" through "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that promoted the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid supplement to the China Daily in Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials in a statement to Reuters characterized as a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China “now doubles this harassment by launching propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“Through the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at a newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you will find limited voices of opposition, and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s disturbing economic trajectory as the media are under strong pressure from the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that "some of China's most prominent newspapers have declined an offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what newspaper it was.
In Kavanaugh's debacle, Republicans have distanced voters before the midterm elections, analysts warn.
With many Republicans standing by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and defending him over several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn it will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming midterm elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding the event were very turbulent, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their vote.
Things like that can’t go back,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, said in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last push to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is coming!”, protesting in the Senate hallway as Republicans who control the Judicial Committee prepared to continue with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say they’re already at a high level, which is true.
But they could also be taller, especially among women in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t go to the polls.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest there could be a negative reaction if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
“It’s a real mess for the Big Old Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve bench, it’s about how the Republicans approached it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats elect, said in a statement.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more leaning towards him.
A new poll published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitively or likely believe the truth of Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they confidently or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, along with at least another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is developing on the basis of Berners-Lee’s open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and the people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal network data storage” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on the same browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that it is up to the user to decide who can access what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, in the words of John Bruce, the company’s CEO, is to provide the company with the resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, developers from around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Even as Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration on the occasion of the decoration of the First World War priests with the Victoria Cross
A celebration in honor of the only Anglican priest who was decorated with the Victoria Cross as a fighter in World War I was held in his hometown 100 years later .
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had received the highest British military honor.
The memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of Vann's grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be uncovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's feat for which he received the award.
According to a report in the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the St. Quentin's Canal "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front lines and with "incredible courage" led the unit forward before rushing onto a Polish cannon without any help and beheading three of the military detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never achieve that arouses humility.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade orchestra.
Vann said he felt "very honored to be taking part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Mixed Martial Arts Fans Stayed Up All Night Watching Bellator 206, and Instead Got Peppa Pig
Imagine this <0xCC><0xB6> staying up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches so that you would eventually be disabled from tracking the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they were broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, viewers in the UK were shocked when the broadcast was interrupted by Peppa Pig.
Many were not impressed at all after the struggle alone kept them awake until the early hours of the morning.
One fan on Twitter described the cut-off as “some kind of sick joke.”
“Under state regulation, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Yupi, Piglet Peppa."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said he would align his schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
“When I consider reruns, I think we can probably sort something out,” Coker said.
“But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until Sunday comes to us, when they will already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were many correspondences circulating that were not even friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't, the problem is state-owned.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six <0xCC><0xB6> which we usually do. We tried to give more to our fans, but we went too far.
These are unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Inferior' to Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality <0xCC><0xB6> but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that until he went to high school he was not aware that “not everyone is like me.”
In a statement to Radio 4’s Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that winning the Olympics was less important to him since he became a father.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, those feelings of inferiority and difference from others were the right things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He says he wanted to prove he was "someone and something" so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent person advocating for LGBT people and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference had never been a problem for him.
“When you’re so young, you go through so much,” he said, referring to his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, they became the parents of a son they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his “whole perspective” had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, the whole story would have been about ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn’t accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be here long enough to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand as he breathed out, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I only knew that it was what I had dreamed all my life to jump in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
This was also the inspiration for the selection of the first song " Proud " by singer Heather Small , which echoed in it during the preparations for the Olympic Games and which is always chilling .
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game of the Ryder Cup, but will have to recover completely to avoid an inconvenient turning point.
Mickelson, who plays a record-breaking 12th time in this two-year competition, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-point games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he was often for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and elaborating on his game on the training ground in hopes of correcting what was bothering him.
Never the most precise player, even at the height of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National pitch, where a long uneven pitch routinely punishes imprecise punches.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson faces precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, in Sunday’s ninth match.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he trusted his man <0xCC><0xB6> more than that and could not say.
“He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“There’s a lot of confidence.”
He is famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I don't think he's going to play two games.
I imagined there would be more, but that's how it turned out, and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
Mickelson is set to beat Nick Fald's record for the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence has also brought some intangible value to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy for the team,” he said.
“I think the younger players had fun with him this week too, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big advantage on the last day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an awkward race.
The Dane made his debut in a match at Valderrama in 1997, where the team of Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a narrow difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 <0xCC><0xB6> 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You are constantly reminded that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a narrow difference," Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team win by a score of 5 <0xCC><0xB6> 3 on Friday and yesterday lead the National with a score of 6 <0xCC><0xB6> on the pitch of 10 <0xCC><0xB6>
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will play with full force.
Go out on the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floors sound on the board.
We have a goal, which is to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
I talk all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who stands against us – the biggest players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run in front of the ore in this.
Tomorrow we have to face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main individual performances, and that's something completely different.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you’re there as an individual, your golf skills are put to the ultimate test.
That’s the message you have to pass on to the players, and that’s that they have to do their best tomorrow.
Now leave your teammate because he too has to give his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those big turnarounds on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up a loser after Europe performed a “miracle in Medina.”
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should strive to achieve excellent results at the very start, like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this runs in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
Accordingly, we organized our line-up and placed the guys as if, you know, we were going to try to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter to face the rest of the Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys goes in this order because I think it covers everything,” Bjorn said of the selected players for the individual matches.
Germany's new warship put on hold again
The latest frigate of the German navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but it will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and increased costs, local media reported.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying problems after the delivery hit the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, commissioned by the Navy back in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period <0xCC><0xB6> it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to their home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that state-of-the-art warships <0xCC><0xB6> which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power abroad <0xCC><0xB6> by the time of entry into service will already become obsolete, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would render the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors <0xCC><0xB6> halved compared to the older Bremen-class frigates.
Also, the ship has been shown to be dramatically overweight, which reduces its efficiency and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to weigh twice as much as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project <0xCC><0xB6> including crew training <0xCC><0xB6> also becomes a problem.
The price is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) <0xCC><0xB6> compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, admitted that the navy was actually “out of deployable ships”.
The official said the problem increased over time, as the old ships were decommissioned and there were no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the navy.
National Foundation eavesdrop on the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will clarify the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Endowment for Scotland (NTS), will follow common and marshy dwarf bats, as well as brown long-eared and river bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile screenings using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of the sound of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's voice and what the species does.
Then a habitat map and a report will be made to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are endangered by construction and landscaping that affect shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their habits of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained specialists, who regularly conduct research, inspect shelters and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bat species that inhabit Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the estate is an ideal area for them.
"Here at Threave we have a huge space for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
However, there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us better understand what they need to progress.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking for the presence of bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, since the unintentional destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and young, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass them or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative for Scotland of the Bat Protection Association, urged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their populations are progressing."
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after filing the charges, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” said the five-time Ballon d’Or winner in front of the camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the footballer added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they called “unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for “moral damage in an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that “99 percent” was a “good guy” who had been let down by that “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual intercourse, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and was photographed for her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “fearful of retaliation” and worried she would be “publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of transferring to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve as part of a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100m transfer.
Brexit: UK will ‘regret forever’ for losing carmakers
The UK will “repent forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He said it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of waiting at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“It is my view that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will experience a production backlog at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have voiced fears of leaving the EU without a deal over possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the carmakers relates to the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a break at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to hold more stock at its plant in Derbyshire than it needed for a day, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We want to reach the best possible agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's programme today.
“Evidence from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers shows that we absolutely need to be able to continue this very successful supply chain.”
Toyota could not say how long production could be halted, but warned that in the long run, the additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite trade union, said his members are increasingly worried: “In my experience, once those jobs go, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thus jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been fomenting gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing the wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But he went to the White House last Monday amid announcements that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he “would not like” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the lawsuits against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date has not been set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed by another week taking into account everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists would dispute the claim: Sanders hasn’t held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to the aversion to "theatrical behavior" of television reporters, although she said: "I will not oppose the fact that they are bragging."
She then hinted that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president organizes more meetings to answer questions than any president before him,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We’ve analyzed the numbers.”
Short speeches will continue to happen, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask a question to the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make that happen often, and you’ve seen that happen in the last few weeks, and it’s just that you can talk to the President of the United States that will replace the brief remarks to the press.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of a gathering of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland because of fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU staff working for the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, withdrawal negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union have resumed, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line-up player Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31 <0xCC><0xB6> 27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters the injury happened just before halftime.
“He got to the line of playground and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the pitch before putting him on a stretcher and sending him for further examinations.
A representative of Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there were no "details on the type/range of the injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing experience, plays his first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five knockouts before leaving the game, scoring a total of 18 knockouts in a season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the UK
Under the new plans of the Conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
The tax increase will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the UK <0xCC><0xB6> and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The tax increase will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the UK, and the additional money will contribute to the government’s efforts to fight homelessness.
The additional fee <0xCC><0xB6> that is added to the current fee, including the increase that was introduced two years ago on other homes and real estate purchased for rent <0xCC><0xB6> can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents who do not reside in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the society of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country <0xCC><0xB6> especially in the capital <0xCC><0xB6> have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help more young people reach their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not exploiting the land, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable real estate to fix the “shame on the housing situation” in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to unprovoked evictions.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to renewing the British dream – that the lives of every new generation should be better.
And that involves repairing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes as easily as hardworking Britons.
The dream of owning a home has become too far away for a large number of people, and the shame of homelessness is still very real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his “ultimate ambition” is to one day become the governor of Scotland.
Scott (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which currently occupies third place in the Premier League, with three points less than the leading ones.
He moved to Stadium Lights this summer after leading St. Mirren again in the Scottish Football Championship last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and that always pulled me back.
But that opportunity could only come true if I was successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paul Di Canio.
The former head of Allo Athletic said he felt no fear because he inherited such famous names in such a large club, having previously declined calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My success at this point will be measured by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club there again.”
Ross is only in his third year as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months of experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from relegation to the third category and led St. Mirren from the edge of relegation to the champions of the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," recalled Alloe's takeover.
“I really believed that managing was more than playing.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, earning solidly and enjoying quite successful moments.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I’m still going through it in terms of stress and work pressure, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I do. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for a pint is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to research.
The summer heatwave increased revenues for British pubs struggling with finances, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw revenues rise by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the Business Advisory Board of the Office of the Chief Accountant, who collected the data, said: “Continuing good weather and England’s participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when the revenues of pubs increased by 2.8 percent, with more by restaurant now.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where mostly drinks are served made much greater profits on equal terms compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where mostly food is served have also been hit by the heat, though not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent over the month, and food sales declined by three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s travel and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the external market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales will be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food service managers, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed respite."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand share growth.

One in Five Kids Has Secret Social Media Accounts They Hide From Their Parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being published.
Twenty Percent of Students Say They Have a “Main” Account to Show to Parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, open secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts <0xCC><0xB6> references to a photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened fears of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they used a cleaned-up “main” account to show their parents while having private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others with the words “rape me”.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Principals (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of which admit to owning private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'voice of athletes' on Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as non-executive director at the annual board meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and President Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those involved in the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making her a member of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of an athlete and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, out of his total four Olympic golds, and is now a regular BBC expert, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting, but he fully recovered, learned to walk again and today for agile exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
Divided opinions on the Internet about the advertisement for a traitor who compares mothers with cows
A traitorous advertising company compared breastfeeding mothers to milking cows has sparked divisions of opinion online.
To commemorate the launch of a product claimed to be “the world’s first silent wearable traitor,” Elvie’s consumer technology company released an ad inspired by an ironic music video to showcase the freedom the new traitor gives mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows with music that reads: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see any tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, this is not a udder, it’s my breasts.”
Then comes the chorus: "Pump, pump, I feed the baby, pump, pump, I hug my ladies."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen a few days after they are born,” one person wrote.
Traitor Elvie discreetly fits in breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: “Understandably traumatic for mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added, "It's a totally ridiculous advertisement."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that her song was “sorry.”
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The milk betrayal made me feel just like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I understand it exactly as it is.
“This is a brilliant product,” she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun commercial aimed at moms who dispense milk (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they all danced with discreet traitors placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who issue milk say that they feel like cows.
The traitor Elvie, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even go out during the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director of Mother, commented: “Traitor Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
Making a parallel between depicting women and cows, we wanted to put betrayal and all its challenges in the spotlight, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time that traitor Elvie has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to tent camp on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children under sponsorship.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their own possibility of staying in the country by stepping forward and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been recorded in criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor household in the country are illegal, and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals," Mr Albence said.
According to shelter workers, in order to speed up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via videoconferencing, rather than in person, to bring their case before the immigration court to obtain legal status.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be promptly deported.
According to statements from shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Proponents said these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is very likely that signs that the child is struggling will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to emotionally prepare them or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, while millions have been left homeless.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" of terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted the refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned they will not help rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to resume political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a massive Russian-backed attack by Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including Nusra-linked fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked front, "who will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new government-opposition committee soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the commission's work should be limited to "revising articles of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why Trump wins second term
By that logic, Mr. Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!”
Currently, there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, headline viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed the audience with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the producer of ABC’s drama “Designated Survivor,” about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, comedy author and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of abortion law stemming from the Roe v. Wade trial, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet you surpass the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching for the sixth hour a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used “deep background” sources for his book “Fear,” about Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket (“a garment full of arrogance,” writes the Washington Post, “Stormy this,” Daniel’s descriptions) and implications.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“Part of what he makes you think of it as a reality show is that he feeds you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show “The Pawn Shop,” about the rotating cast and day-to-day plot of the Trump show.
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're going to fall behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny outside his house on the north coast of Kauai Island with a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 ° C), but he was inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging by a thread.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside pours into the most uncertain mid-term congressional election race
Unsurprisingly, the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts resulting in two candidates running for the same seat.
Pittsburgh's recently redeveloped suburban district stands out Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in a second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally tailored in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a fight to fund the campaign between the party's main fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a widely followed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That position was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county with a 20-point lead.
Political analysts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S. decides whether to punish El Salvador for supporting China and then withdraws
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to summon U.S. diplomatic mission chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
But the penalties were considered only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to resume a similar gathering last year, seen as progress in efforts to stem the flow of migrants to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively terminating any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
HISTORY
The next step could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now very substantial publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller reportedly also focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was colluded with Russia as part of its attack on our election.
If the majority in Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibilities in that body, just as he prepares to appear before voters again, and perhaps ultimately a jury equal to him.
There are a lot of "if"s, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable - nor those like him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, only the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are now facing several of these points of inflection.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that he secretly suggested filming the president last year and speculated about his incompetence.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“How are we going to respond if the FBI’s recently ordered investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it has been confirmed to the Supreme Court despite convincing allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?”
And above all, are we going to vote in a midterm congressional election that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that hooked-cross table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrel earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance in a 2 <0xCC><0xB6> 2 draw season with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that score as a stepping stone for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game believing we could achieve something and scored a point.
Maybe we could have stolen the game in the end, but, in general, a tie is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let’s hope we can score three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I’m sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a tough one, with everything that happened with my injuries and changes at the club itself, but now there’s a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Let’s hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women can't sleep for fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the Nationwide study respondents said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking steps to start a conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caring unless you express your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value to help cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth <0xCC><0xB6> as long as you have the money.
Organize your legal documents: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Engage health representatives to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider giving a power of attorney to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your bills if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Provide details in a written plan to be prepared.
"It's not just about finances, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
“Keep that plan at hand.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
As communications were cut off, aid officers were unable to receive any information from the province of Donggale, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palu since the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a county that stretches along more than 300 km of the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggali.
The tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the seismic Pacific Circle of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees Celsius struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hits Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about pleading guilty, he pleaded “not guilty, of course,” the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed in the quake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck close to central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare federal crime sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a truck to rent a Home Depot store to attack a cycling track along the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists who crossed his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to the possible death penalty, according to a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as “abhorrent, cruel and corrupt.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York City in 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, on the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching a video of ISIS on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to raise an ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at a Conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must have "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics <0xCC><0xB6> as one of the MPs Theresa May suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MEP Peter Bone told a procession in Birmingham that the UK would have "come out" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May’s challenge to reconciling her deeply divided ranks is highlighted by Tories prone to staying behind who join a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her compromise plan “Chequers” in the midst of attacks from Brexit supporters, supporters of staying and the EU.
Allies have insisted she will continue her attempts to strike a deal with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave campaign rally in Solihull that he wanted to “reject Chequers.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given the title and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,” he said.
A Wellingborough MP added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to kick out Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely incorrect.”
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also in the procession, addressing reporters with the words: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and elected us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In a note to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage told the crowd that politicians must be made to "feel the pressure" if they were to let down a decision taken in a 2016 referendum.
"It's a question of trust between us people and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them ‘it’s not going to get away with it.’
In a message to enthusiastic audiences, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the remainder marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in downtown Birmingham.
Thousands of activists waved "Tories against Brexit" banners after the group launched this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they suffered with the party’s application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus Plus plan, for the smooth state of the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s all a complete farce.
“There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “seriously consider” running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday at an imminent social gathering with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been speculated for some time that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
He asked her if she was planning to run for president.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the head."
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting at Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims that occurred on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information about the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was killed early Friday near the campus of Southern University.
“Wayde Sims sustained a bullet wound to the head and eventually died as a result,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, at 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene and possessing the gun and killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a 198-centimeter third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games in the first 10 line-ups last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to world title after ranking secures him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team rankings would "play a big role in the race".
From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton to enter the traffic at the back, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one lap later and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the wheel-on-wheel action that made the Ferrari driver reluctant to leave the free interior in danger of falling behind after a double move in defending the third curve.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race while relying on his tyres to reach the fast finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally made it to the boxing lap 44, but failed to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri has been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has done a really remarkable job to achieve the formation finish,” Hamilton said.
It was very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were “bad and nasty and dishonest.”
“The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at publications and leaks, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn’t do it.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release the information?
Remember her answer...did you release the document - 'aaa, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not.'
Hold on a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Senator Feinstein in July detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh and leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the information had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t release her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, which she asked for.”
However, her denial did not meet with the approval of the president, who at a rally on Saturday evening commented: "Let me tell you something - it was a very bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use those accusations for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power at all costs.
You see the meanness, the abomination, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 <0xCC><0xB6> 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for their loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a 5 <0xCC><0xB6> 3 win in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two goals in the early minutes with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilliers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for the team Adam Keefe, who came from behind and beat Dundee with a result of 2 <0xCC><0xB6> 1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, and the Giants have won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 a.m., assisted by Kendall McFaul, assisted by David Rutherford to double the lead by scoring Beauvilliers four minutes later.
In the hectic opening of the match, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie to tie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with the lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to a tie in goal-scoring at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the second third, and he secured victory when his team was already halfway to victory in the last third of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are hosting the Milton Keynes team in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on board avoid an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been declared a hero after being killed while ensuring safe take-off of an airplane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, with many trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower, which was swinging heavily.
He stayed to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be transferred to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken for that," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the state disaster mitigation agency saying access to the cities of Donggali, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"It is believed that the death toll continues to rise, as many bodies are still under the rubble and many could not have been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching up to six metres in height devastated Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are bringing in bodies every minute.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia: Air Niugini Says One Man Is Missing After Lagoon Plane Crash
The airline, which owns the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims one man is missing, after it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had been unable to trace one of the passengers since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to break through the water that reached their waist to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were working nearby to repair the dock also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been killed in accidents by PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst presents timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed a case on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, a U.S. Justice Department analyst, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to solve a puzzle about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contrary to his previous claims.
When records showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying because his truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls and contact details from her phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Aware Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to evoke a negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band The High Breed says hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common are reborn in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York Nanny Sues Couple for Laying Off After Racist Message
A New York-based nanny is suing the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, comparing the accusation to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dissatisfaction when on her arrival on the first working day of 2016, she learned that the new nanny of her children, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEEEE, OTHER NEGRO," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a note to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After realizing her mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an “inconvenient” situation and fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that her former nanny, who was an African-American, was not doing her job well and was expecting a Filipina instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day of work, and then went home.
Maurice now sues the couple for severance pay and seeks compensation of $350 per day for the six-month period she was originally hired for, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do things like that," she told The Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to claims that the racists, saying that ending Maurice's job was reasonable to do, because of fears that because of the insult she would later be unable to be trusted.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent her in the message.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco, the husband, told The Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife had only been given two months of maternity leave after the baby was born and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You're going to sue someone who's in a situation like this.
"That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the court case is still pending, a court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared readers would not identify with the talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in a letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who’s going to read the book for the first time before it’s published.
It’s very funny what we now know about Paddington’s huge success.”
Saying her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before the little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, would be optimistic if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a “very important member of the family,” she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't a boaster," she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was all perceived as some kind of achievement of your own child: you’re proud of him, even though none of that was really your doing.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed the credit exclusively to Paddington.
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was urgently transported to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nade called regularly to say that it was really bad and that they believed that he would not get away with it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart working were slowly losing effect and leaving her body system.
She died shortly before boarding, and that's when it all went out.
All I had to do was sit and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it all to myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were unaware of the temptations she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“I lowered my head, and tears poured down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a strong sense of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women mourn messages on bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Ms. Davis’ son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a cook with an infectious smile that awaited a shining career.
“Everyone remembers him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill any room with joy.
However, before his death, he left his job because he was in a "really dark state".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that it will have a negative effect.”
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea with cards “so that people know there’s someone you can go and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don't sit in silence <0xCC><0xB6> you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies's, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas, he was at the very bottom when the children opened the gifts, he didn’t look them in the eye or want anything else.”
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to overcome it: “All this leaves a big hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we will keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI opens investigation
"I thought we might be able to bring a little unity if we were really able to get something like what he asked for a time and scope-limited investigation," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "disintegrating" amid a ingrained party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is driven by the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections arrive in just five weeks, on November 6th, if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, then they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to lead the desired man to elections for the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has repeatedly called on senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
The Senate is currently seated in 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to overturn with a decisive vote and confirm his place on the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'declining' under Kim
Refugees from North Korea to South Korea have declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Citing United Southern Alliance ministry data, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 defectors last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors are tighter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and the higher fees smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of the North Korean refugees were eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
North-South relations <0xCC><0xB6> which are still technically at war <0xCC><0xB6> have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stalled denuclearisation talks.
This came after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for not making any progress since.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it is not considered that under such circumstances we will be the first to disarm," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh ‘Hysterical’, Says He Is Unfit to Serve in Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented on Saturday's interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman ever behaved like that, she would be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost yelling and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him “grotesque and coordinated defamation” orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved she could not participate in the Supreme Court's work because it showed she had prejudices against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi backed down.
“I’m going to say this: if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not fit to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law stemming from the Roe v. Wade trial, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justifiable criticism, anger that has accumulated for months and years <0xCC><0xB6> all this cannot be gotten rid of without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. What do you think?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be the CEO and who said that she cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.'"
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, is how, on one occasion, when I was crying out of unspeakable anger, an elderly woman <0xCC><0xB6> a cold manager who I was always a little afraid <0xCC><0xB6> dragged me to the stairs.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they'll think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me through laughter 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates in the race already and they certainly didn’t need another one.
Someone called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was already advancing, she was lagging behind in fundraising, and vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of the supporters, who gave men $1,000 each, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?” she asked.
While she said she wouldn’t launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions <0xCC><0xB6> gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration at the system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism <0xCC><0xB6> that her throat froze.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder's reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my tombstone.
"She cried."
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The start of the U.S.-China trade war has echoed loudly and, while the battle is far from over, the rift between countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in some way, and has recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has vowed to strike back at the U.S., and the world’s second-largest economy will not surrender anytime soon.
Washington’s withdrawal could be achieved by yielding to demands, but public submission to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war could provide positive support to China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to trigger an economic downturn in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate for strategic thinking who focused on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to rebuild a country devastated by a more than seven-year war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence have now been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 <0xCC><0xB6> 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown while the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for almost the entire tournament, on the 16th hole pair 3, sent the ball into the water at the first blow, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been brilliant in all rounds and has become one of four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was kicked out by Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest-ranked player of the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most wins in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop crying.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that I won the cup again.
It's all up to the team. I'm happy to be able to help," said Garcia, full of emotions after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who beat the legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, in singles games on Sunday, with a 2&1 score.
“I have an incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play,” said Rahm, 23, in a statement.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, and is located right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has struggled all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance by his team, U.S. captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At some point, we have resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll get over it, I'll work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to take people's hats off.
We're outplayed."
