Researchers from the university said that these two compositions react with each other and form crystals that can block the function of the kidneys.
When adding melanin and cyanuric acid to the cat's urine, the researchers observed the formation of crystals.
According to the results of infrared spectral analysis, the structure and composition of these crystals are similar to those found in the urine of affected animals.
I don't know if you understand this or not, but most of the goods that are shipped to this country from Central America are not subject to customs duties.

Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh's sheriff's courthouse accused of murdering her son.
She is awaiting indictment and trial while in custody. But given that her photographs have been published many places, any eyewitness testimony may be questioned.
In other regions of the UK, this is a widespread practice, but in Scotland, the judiciary operates differently – courts believe that the publication of photographs can be potentially harmful.
“It seems that journalists are taking a dangerous path when they publish photos of suspects, etc.,” says Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Central Office of the High Court, empowered to bring criminal responsibility, told reporters that at least until the indictment is filed, no further comments will be received.
According to the information received, the document mentions a border dispute that Palestine wants to resolve in such a way as to preserve the borders that existed before the outbreak of the 1967 war in the Middle East.

Martelly was sworn in yesterday by a new Provisional Electoral Council, which consists of nine members.
This is Marty's fifth election in four years.
The presidential commission last month recommended the early dissolution of the Provisional Election Council as one of many measures to prepare the country for new elections.
To the major anti-regime protests that began in October, Martelly responded by the commission.
The reason for the protests, which were sometimes violent and furious, was the lack of elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.

The number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008 (according to a survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal elections).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, said she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of the respondents. They want Queen Elizabeth II to become the last Australian monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 percent of respondents who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent who, on the contrary, adhere to the opinion that this should never happen.

On the formation of a new species of birds in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands written in a study published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
According to the report of the researchers of the Princeton University (USA) and the University of Uppsala (Sweden), the evolution of a new species occurred in just two generations, although earlier it was believed that this process requires much more time. The emergence of a new species has become possible
With gold you can cast different shapes. It can be rolled on thin sheets.
You can pull it into a thin wire, which then has no problem twisting and clapping. You can, in addition, split it or roll it into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to the second metal. It could be so thin that from time to time it was used to decorate the illustrations depicted in the books - the so-called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH level of a certain chemical. You can make such an acid-base indicator from the juice of red cabbage yourself.
The color of cabbage juice varies depending on the level of acidity or alkalinity of a particular substance.
The pH level in the test chemical is determined on the basis of the number of hydrogen ions (the letter "H" in pH).
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (a hydrogen atom is known to contain one proton and one electron).
Stir these two dry powders in a circle until they merge into a single whole, and then wet your hands to make a ball of them.
Moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which creates an amazing feeling. At the same time, a kind of shell is formed.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mahenjo-Dara could find a flushing toilet attached to a complex sewer system.
In the houses of the Greek cities of Crete and Santorini, belonging to the Minoan period, the remains of sewer systems were found.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes installed in public baths, in which women and men were together.
You use a satellite when you call someone who is thousands of miles away from you.
In space, a satellite receives a call, then almost instantly reflects it back.
Rocket used to send a satellite into space. Scientists have to use telescopes in space, because because of the effects of the earth's atmosphere light is broken and the image is distorted.
In order for a telescope or satellite to enter space, a large rocket more than 100 feet high is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. Easier and faster movement is the greatest thing that the wheel has done for us.
Thanks to him, we have trains, cars and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats. Their prey is also medium-sized — they hunt both cowards and antelopes with deer.
In addition, many small cats (including outdoor pets) catch and eat more small prey — insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the fact that each occupies its own niche, i.e. has only its own function, and therefore it does not need to compete with other cats.
Lions are one of the most sociable cats: they live in large flocks known as passes.
Pride can include up to three adult males who are relatives, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
In most cases, females are close relatives, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Behavior of lion passes and packs of wolves or dogs in many ways similar. The latter can strongly resemble lions in behavior (but not other large cats) in that they pose a deadly danger to prey.
The tiger is able to climb (but not so well), jump over long distances, swim and pull with a force five times stronger than a strong person, as a well-trained athlete.
Tiger belongs to the same group with lions, leopards and jaguars (genus panther). No other cats, except these four, can not roar.
The roar of a tiger resembles a sentence, which consists of sharp and loud words, rather than a full-bodied roar of a lion.
Acelots are used as food for small animals. If possible, they catch monkeys, rodents, snakes and birds. Almost all the animals on which it hunts are much smaller than acelots.
According to scientists, acelots follow and find prey by smelling traces on the ground.
Thanks to night vision, they can see well in the dark and move very confidently. They hunt acelots, merging with the environment and from hiding attacking their prey.
If a small group of living creatures (small population) breaks away from the main population from which they come (say, when moving through a river or mountain range, or if such living creatures migrate to a new island, so that they will be quite difficult to come back, they will often find themselves away.
In this new environment, other resources and competitors, therefore, to become the strongest competitor, the new population will need other features or adaptations compared to those that it had before.
The original population has not changed at all: as before, it still needs to adapt.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the animals are more and more reminiscent of the main population from which they have separated.
Thousands or even millions of years will pass, and sooner or later the two mentioned populations will look so different that no one will think about assigning them to the same species.
This process we call the formation, which actually means the emergence of new species. The formation is an inevitable result and a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe. They, in addition, use carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants "cook" themselves food from sunlight through photosynthesis. In addition, they give a shadow.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from them. We eat mostly plants. And animals would also not survive without plants.
For their time, the masochists were supersedents, so they were not afraid of anything and no one, except other masochists.
On his long jaws bloomed over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and at the top of his mouth was another additional row. This meant that his prey would not be saved.
It is not known exactly, however, it is possible that he had a split tongue. The diet of masochists consisted of large fish, turtles and other masochists. Probably, they could also eat and representatives of their species.
Besides, he threw himself at everything that fell into the water; his tray was not even worthy of such a giant as the Tyrannosaurus rex.
Despite the fact that their food would mostly not cause us surprise, some dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual. Among them – wild boars, peacocks, snails and one of the rodents, known as the peanut sun.
Another difference was that when the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, the wealthy arranged banquets on which they ate and rested at the same time.
In the composition of the dishes cooked in ancient Rome, could not include products that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia later.
They had, in particular, no potatoes, no tomatoes, no corn, no cocoa. Needless to say, that no ancient Roman has never had the opportunity to ask a turkey.
For each of his gods, the inhabitants of Babylon built the main temple, which was considered his house.
The faithful offered sacrifices to their gods, and the priests tried to meet their needs by holding various feasts and ceremonies in their honor.
Each temple had its own inner courtyard and sanctuary, where only priests could visit.
In some cases, during the construction of temples erected special towers, similar to the pyramids. They were known as zikuraty.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary dedicated to God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house did not matter much.
For the most part, the life of the Jewish family was spent in the fresh air.
Women cooked from the outside; shops were just open shelves, which were facing the street. Ladies were built of stone.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was of great value.
The territory of Greenland was not densely populated. According to the Scandinavian saga, Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and sailing to the west, he stumbled upon Greenland, which he called the "Green Land".
Despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland there were many differences, despite the fact that each of these countries was "Scandinavian".
If you’ve seen the movie Treasure of a Nation, you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence there was a treasure map.
However, this is not true. Despite the fact that something is really written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, it was written: "The original version of the Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The record in inverted form is at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it, no one knows for sure, but it is known that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) at the beginning of its existence was rolled up for preservation.
Therefore, it is possible that this record was added there simply as a memorabilia.
Thanks to the Normandy landings and subsequent battles, it was possible to liberate the north of France, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
It was under the authority of the "vishes". It was those Frenchmen who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragon began and the Allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and the forces of "Free France" in just two weeks liberated the southern territories of France, after which they headed towards Germany.
Civilization is the only culture of a fairly large group of people who work together and live in society.
The above term "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, i.e., "civilian". The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun civis, that is, "civilian", as well as to the noun civitas, or "city" or "city-state". The state is.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge over generations, uniform distribution, and a sustainable cultural footprint.
Often, small cultures are not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, because they disappear without leaving behind significant historical evidence.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states initially established a weak central government under the Treaty of Confederation of thirteen states. This government included only the Congress.
The Congress had no powers to introduce taxes, and since there was no national executive and judiciary, it counted on enforcing all laws with the support of state bodies, which were often unwilling to cooperate.
In addition, he did not have the power to repeal the state's tax laws and tariffs.
According to the Treaty of Confederation, the unanimous consent of all the states was required to make the changes, and the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, as well as the German national team, occupies the second place among the strongest national teams in the world. In 2006, it won the World Cup in football.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, puck hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 races belong to the popular sports here.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is located on almost 7,000 islands, the largest of which is the island of Honshu. Thanks to this, Japan ranks 7th in the world among the largest islands.
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in terms of geography, because it is a cluster or group of islands.
The history of Taiwan began in the 15th century. It was then that its name was recorded by European sailors passing by, as "Pharmoza" - it meant "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the territory of southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of the primitive practice of breadmaking. For the processing of rice and sugar plantations, the company hired Chinese workers.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) in 1683 conquered the western and northern Taiwanese territories and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, under which Japan was transferred the right of sovereignty over the island, and the latter operated in Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main objects: Incihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with three windows.
In order for tourists to get a better idea of what most of the buildings on the edges of the complex originally looked like, the latter were rebuilt.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
So, the world's most popular photo format for fixed frames is the format 35 mm. At the turn of the era of analog shots, this film format prevailed.
Such a film is now produced, however, more importantly, the ratio of its width and height are now used in the formats of the digital camera matrix.
This may be a bit off the beaten track, but in fact the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Accordingly, it is considered that the ratio of sides for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain a simpler proportion of whole numbers) is 3:2.
The same or similar aspect ratios have many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats).
The rule of thirds, which is often attacked and ridiculed, is a simple advice that ensures dynamism and at the same time maintains a certain degree of order in the image.
If you believe him, then the best place to place the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photo in the vertical and horizontal planes on the third (see example).
During this period of European history, the activities of the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, came under close attention.
With all the linguistic and cultural differences that took place, the Christian religion united the European countries for more than a thousand years.
Everything from the king to the proto-people was under her all-pervading authority.
The essence of one of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to reduce poverty and alleviate suffering, and that it is for this that the Church's money exists.
For more than a thousand years, the central ecclesiastical authorities were in Rome. Due to such concentration of power and money, many wonder whether this dogma is being fulfilled.
The United Kingdom initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of hostilities.
The embargo on the supply of vital military and civil goods, although it violated universally recognized international law, which over the past two centuries has been enshrined at the legislative level by several international agreements, has proved to be an effective strategy.
The UK replaced international waters so that the ships could not get into certain areas of the ocean. Thus, it put at risk even neutral ships.
Due to the fact that there was no significant reaction to this tactic, Germany believed that there would be no unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the majority of citizens and countries were dominated by sentiments of pacifism and isolation.
States and peoples intended to avoid such a situation in the future, because they had already witnessed the horrors and atrocities during the First World War.
In 1884 Tesla moved to live in the United States of America, because he got a job in the company "Edison", located in New York.
A total of 4 cents, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison, written by Charles Bacharel (his manager from his previous job), were in his pocket when he arrived in the United States.
In ancient China, there were unique ways to designate different eras. At every stage of the history of China or in each family under power there were distinctive dynasties.
In addition, the periods of the reign of the dynasty were divided by the periods of divided provinces, when instability reigned. The most famous of them was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During the mentioned periods, many courtiers who fought for the throne led ruthless fighting among themselves.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the era of the Three Kingdoms: thousands of people died during the struggle for the opportunity to occupy the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences, including the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of a metric system, the emergence of nationalism, and the belief that the country does not belong to an individual ruler, but to the entire people.
In addition, various posts after the Revolution became available to all male candidates, as a result of which the most successful and ambitious were pushed upwards.
The same thing happened in the army, because if earlier military ranks were assigned, based on the rank, now - on the basis of skills and abilities.
In addition, many other oppressed workers from other countries were inspired by the French Revolution to launch their own revolutions.
Mohammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond worldly life. To meditate and reflect, he often visited a cave on Mount Noor (translated as "light"), which is known as "Hira".
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, gives a very bright idea of the spiritual foundations of Mohammad.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world - it is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if someone knows about its existence. Inside the cave you are in complete isolation.
Apart from the clear beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains, you will not see anything. From the cave very little of this world can be seen and heard.
The Pyramid of Cheops is one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
The Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramids that were erected to honor the memory of the deceased pharaoh. It was built in the third century BC.
On the Giza plateau, also known as the "Necropolis of Giza", in the Death Valley of Egypt, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs were dedicated to Pharaoh's wives and family members.
The symbol denoting the movement of the loop upwards looks like a "V", and downwards - like a bracket or a square without a bottom side.
"The movement of the loop upwards" means that you need to start the movement from the end of the loop and lead them upwards, and "the movement of the loop downwards" - that you need to start with a pad (this is the place where your hand holds the loop) and lead the loop downwards.
The movement of the loop upwards usually gives a softer sound, and downwards - stronger and more confident.
You can put your marks with a pencil, but do not forget that the printed symbols of the loop are there not just for that, but for a certain musical reason, so they usually need to be stored.
On October 6, 1789, because of the crowd of women from the market frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (four-year-old Louis-Charles and 11-year-old Maria Theresa), as well as Madame Elizabeth, the king's sister, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris.
The royal family in the carriage was taken to Paris. On the way they surrounded the crowd — the people in it whistled, muttered and shouted threats to the king and queen.
The king and queen had to open the windows of the carriage under the influence of the crowd.
At one point, a man in the crowd waved at the queen, who was already terrified to death, with the head of a guard killed at Versailles.
The military expenses of the U.S. imperialists, which were incurred in connection with the conquest of the Philippines, had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay a significant portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds placed through the Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the U.S. imperialists would be the excess profits that the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people brought.
In order to understand who the Templars were, it is necessary to understand what became the preconditions for the creation of the Order.
Traditionally, the epoch when these events took place is called the Classical Middle Ages, a period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
First followed the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Classical Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages. The last, as is commonly believed, ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" means a number of practical ideas, from pressure to advance certain technologies or technical necessity to a clear understanding of what human fate is determined by the logic on which the scope of the scientific laws are based, and their implications.
Two common ideas are characteristic of most explanations of technological determinism: the very development of technology is largely outside the boundaries of cultural or political influence, and technology, in turn, makes society inherently them (and not socially conditioned) conditioned.
In particular, there is an opinion that the use of cars stimulates the development of roads.
However, if the number of cars will be small, the national road network has no economic sense. For this reason, the development of new methods of production, which will reduce the cost of owning a car.
Due to the large number of car owners, the number of road accidents is growing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in the field of health, which allow to treat various injuries.
A huge element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was characteristic of Romanticism.
If we talk about the era of Romanticism, then people were strongly influenced by the geography of the presence. Over time, traditions and culture associated with it arose. They were better than arbitrarily introduced laws, because they existed in harmony with the place and position that society occupied.
While Paris is considered the modern fashion capital, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe in feudal times.
Around 400 A.D., the city became known as the epicenter of luxury and retained this status until almost 1100 A.D.
During the XII century, its status as the capital of luxury of the city. This happened mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts, among which there were spicy seasonings and silk, and they were valued much higher than offered in the markets of Byzantium.
It was then that Constantinople gave the title of the fashion capital of Paris.
The flowering of the Gothic style came between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as the 14th century.
At first, Eastern Byzantine culture had a strong influence on the style of clothing.
However, Western styles can be delayed by 25–30 years due to the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style towards the end of the Middle Ages. The fact that people as a result of the Crusades began to use buttons to fasten clothes, was among the greatest events of the time.
In natural agriculture, such a number of food is produced that exclusively meets the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural agriculture is a simple and, as a rule, organic system. It is based on the use of a specific ecological region of preserved seeds in combination with reversal or other completely uncomplicated methods. The goal of all this is to get to the maximum ura
Many farmers have historically led natural agriculture. Now many third world countries still practice it.
Subcultures bring people with similar views, who from the position of social norms feel deprived of attention, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of representatives can be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a particular subculture can occur on the basis of various factors - linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or their combination.
Members of the same subculture often define their belonging to it through distinctive and symbolic style in clothing, mannerisms, and jargon.
As an illustration of what socialization is and how important it is, most often they give an example with children who are unlucky to grow up in an atmosphere of contempt, neglect, various adversities or insults and insults and which adults did not socialize as children.
Such children are called "wild". Some "wild" children for a long time were in captivity (usually so they were treated by their own parents); in some cases, the absence of parental care was the result of unwillingness on the part of parents to notice serious physical or intellectual misconduct.
Before they were abandoned or escaped, wild children could have been severely bullied or traumatized.
Others, as it were, raised animals; according to rumors, some lived on their own in the wild.
When a child is fully raised by animals, his behavior in almost everything (taking into account physical limitations) reflects the behavior of the breeding animal: for example, such a child may be afraid of or indifferent to humans.
While the goal of project learning is to make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaling in this regard goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an assistant that helps people gain new experiences in their studies. This may mean the use of new computer programs or the start of a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual. For example, assistants are both the teacher and a small graft in the program "Microsoft Office".
The software provides virtual assistants. They are needed in order to ask questions, make hints and explain procedures that are difficult for the student or listener to understand on their own.
There are many reasons why children can find themselves in foster families. It can be and ill-treatment, and carelessness, and even coercion.
Children should not be allowed to grow up in an environment where no one cares about them, they are not raised and are not engaged in their education, but it still happens.
In our opinion, the system of foster families is a safe zone for such children.
It is assumed that thanks to our system of foster families, nurses will have reliable medical care, safe homes, good and caring caregivers and a stable education.
It is believed that the foster family must provide for all the needs of the child who was not satisfied in the house from where he was taken.
The Internet is not only a means of mass communication, but also of interpersonal communication.
Thanks to the special characteristics of the Internet, there are additional possibilities for its use and meeting the needs of the audience.
So, for example, it is thought that concepts such as “education” and “socialization” are heavy motives to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal participation" and "permanent relationships" have also been defined by Aimee and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when studying audience responses to websites.
Thanks to the video, important discoveries were made in the explanation of microexpressions - they mean the movement of the muscles of the face, which lasts only a few milliseconds.
It is argued, among other things, that the correct interpretation of microexpressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his work "The Speech of the President" Oliver Sachs noted that the image of people with brain damage, not understanding the speech itself, can, nevertheless, accurately assess the sincerity.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may also be able to correctly interpret human behavior.
The results of research of the twentieth century indicate that there are two foundations of genetic variability, namely, obvious and hidden variations.
Under the influence of the mutation, new genetic variations arise, and with the help of selection, they are removed from the pool of detected ones.
With each successive generation, segregation and recombination mix the variations in these two pools.
In the Savannah, the available plant resources cannot meet the needs of primates for amino acids, when their digestive system is similar to human.
Moreover, if they do not succeed, then the consequences are serious. This is malnutrition, and growth depression, and inevitable death.
The most available plant resources would be proteins, which can be found in legumes and leaves. However, if they are not properly cooked, then the organisms of such primates as we they are difficult to digest.
On the contrary, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large number of proteins, rich in all the necessary amino acids and at the same time easily digested.
Apparently, it is not surprising to find out that our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" in almost the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah in our time.
Sleep interruption refers to the intentional awakening of a sleeping person in the process of normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock, which will wake you up, but not completely.
If it turns out that you switch the clock in a dream, try to put it at the other end of the room. So, you will need to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other options based on biorhythms, before going to bed it is necessary to consume a lot of liquid (primarily water or tea, a well-known diuretic) — this forces a person to get up at night to pray.
The inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the tension of his body and spirit.
The available vitality is all the more positive, the lower voltage. Absolute peace and pleasure are available to everyone.
Enlightenment can be achieved by anyone. The only obstacle on this path is our own negativity and tension.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teaching, which was complemented by the love of Mahayana and a number of techniques of Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines meditation, Kundalini-yoga and love for all humanity.
The followers of Kundalini Yoga claim that to awaken the energy of Kundalini (enlightenment energy), you need to practice certain postures of yoga, mantras and visualizations, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is the main part in the practice of Tibetan meditation. Visualization of various gods allows you to cleanse energy channels, open the chakras and achieve enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, thanks to which the USSR and the United States began to cooperate. After the end of the war, systemic, industrial and cultural contradictions led to quarrels between the countries.
Two years after the end of the fighting, the Cold War begins - the former allies are turned into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years and it really fought armies of friendly countries. The battlefields were located in different regions — from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defense was broken until September 17, 1939, the retreat and regrouping along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
However, in just one night, these plans lost their meaning, as more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers as part of the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts entered the territory of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the other agreements of the Riga Peace Treaty and the non-Soviet-Polish peace treaty.
Cargo transportation by ship is clearly the most efficient way to transport a large number of people and cargo across the oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the naval forces was so that their country was able to transfer people and goods, and at the same time the enemy would not be able to transfer their people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II became one of the most significant examples of this idea. In order to help the United Kingdom, the Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the said movement, using mainly submarines for this purpose.
Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as it had conquered the rest of Europe if the Allies had failed.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them to always have milk, wool, meat and skin at hand.
Usually domestic goats grazed in herds, wandering on the hills or other pastures. Often they were cared for by goats — children or teenagers. The latter performed the role of shepherds. So the animal graze in our time.
In the 16th century, roads were built in England.
Although the roads were only parallel wooden boards, they allowed the stout horses to move at a greater speed and to pull loads with more weight than on the existing uneven roads.
The rails were used to keep the rails in place quite early. However, after a while it became clear that the movement on the rails will be more efficient if they are covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became more widespread, however, due to the presence of iron, the wooden wheels of the wagons wore out faster.
After some time to replace the wooden wheel came iron. The first completely made of metal rails appeared in 1767 g.
The first known means of movement was walking. Two million years ago, with the advent of Homo erectus (meaning "man passing"), people began to walk in a vertical posture.
Australopithecines, their predecessors, usually did not walk directly.
Australopithecines have been found in fossils between 4.2 and 3.9 million years old, but it is possible that seven million years ago the Sahelanthropus was already walking on two legs.
You can be more aware of the environment, you can become a participant in the environmental movement, you can even become an activist, so that in the future the aforementioned suffering will not be very strong.
Sometimes it looks more like a symptomatic treatment, but if we need more than just a temporary solution, we need to find and destroy the root of the problem.
It is quite obvious that thanks to the technical and scientific achievements of mankind, the world has changed significantly. As a result of overpopulation and wasteful lifestyle of people, the number of problems has increased.
After the Declaration was adopted by Congress on July 4, a manuscript signed by Congress Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was delivered to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap Sheets.
On July 8, John Nixon publicly read the document for the first time in the court of Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington received one of the copies, which he read out to his troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
To date, there have been 25 first printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as Dunlap broadsides). The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs managed to survive and that it even still exists, only we call them birds.
Due to the feathers and the ability to fly, many people do not consider them dinosaurs.
But birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their legs, lay eggs, and, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, walk on two hind legs.
Almost all modern computers perform operations with encoded in the form of binary numbers information.
Binary numbers can consist of only one of two values — 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious signs. For example, vomiting is a fairly common symptom, which makes it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
Internal poisoning may first be indicated by an open container with tablets or toxic household chemicals.
Instructions for emergency medical care for this particular poison need to be looked at on the label.
To denote this group of insects entomologists use the term "bug" in the formal sense.
This term was coined because people have long known that they are bed flaps — these insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the kissing flaps and the bed flaps are nesting parasites, they are accustomed to living in the nests or in the house of their master.
About 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are registered in the United States of America. Accordingly, this neurological disease is predominant among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system. The latter includes the brain and spinal cord, as well as the optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from MS.
The couple may come to the conclusion that the upbringing of the baby does not correspond to their interests or the interests of the child that they already have.
These couples can give their children up for adoption.
When adopted, the child's parents give up their parental rights to grow up and be raised by other spouses.
The main goal of science is to find out through the scientific method how the world works. In fact, most scientific research is carried out using this method.
There is, however, not only him. The experiment (this is such a test that is carried out to rule out one or more possible hypotheses using questions and observations) also guides and stimulates scientific research.
Most attention philosophers and naturalists paid to the classical text. First of all, it is, including, and the Bible in Latin.
Generally accepted views at the time were Aristotle's opinions on all scientific issues, including in the field of psychology.
When the number of people who spoke the Greek language decreased, the West was detached from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many biorhythms, which can be observed in the behavior and physiology of animals, largely depend on the presence of endogenous cycles. The latter arise as a result of the functioning of the biological clock.
Most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have had periodic rhythms that are not a direct reaction to external periodic signals.
A biological clock is an autonomous process. Even if signals are not received from the outside, the said process continues in the form of independent freely flowing cycles.
One of the main hypotheses, which claimed that DNA is genetic material, was tested during the Hershey and Chase experiment.
Phages or viruses were used to implant their own DNA in the Hershey and Chase bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they used radioactive phosphorus to denote DNA bacteriophage, or radioactive sulfur to denote a protein bacteriophage.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the fragment of genetic material in which the mutation occurred, and whether the cells affected by it are germline cells, mutations can have a variety of consequences.
Only mutations in germ cells can be inherited. The result of other mutations can be cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts those people who are interested in visiting different natural areas and territories, because they want to enjoy the general view and landscape, including, enjoying the observations of flora and fauna.
An example of what you can do in nature is fishing, hunting, bird watching, visiting parks and exploring ecosystems.
As an example, you can visit, study and photograph orangutans on the island of Barnea.
People leave their cars every morning from small provincial towns to go to work. On the way they pass other people who work where they just left.
In this dynamic transport environment, everyone has something to do with and supports a privately-owned transport system.
Scientific evidence suggests that today's high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has largely contributed to human evolution over the past two million years.
Transportation systems are used by all people who take part in the life of society. And almost all of them are dissatisfied with these transport systems.
In developed countries, you are unlikely to hear so many complaints about falling bridges or water quality.
Why are transport systems a constant source of such complaints, why do they stop working regularly? Is there a reason for the lack of competent transport engineers? Is something more important happening?
The concept of "transport traffic" implies the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is a complex problem, because it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with 100% confidence.
Drivers, fortunately, usually behave quite consistently; therefore, as a rule, traffic flows are characterized by a certain rationally determined sequence and can be approximated using mathematical models.
In order to more fully and qualitatively show what constitutes the movement of vehicles, it has been established how three of its main parameters are related: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
The presence of these connections helps to plan and design road objects, as well as to deal with their operation.
The first of the animals in the air lifted insects. The ability to fly helped them more effectively avoid enemies, and also find partners and food.
In most cases, the wings of insects fold along the body.
As a result, they are able to hide in a variety of small places to hide from predators.
Scabies and single-day flies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
A man named Aristarchus claimed thousands of years ago that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many held a different view — that the Solar System (including the Sun and other stars) revolved around the Earth.
Sounds reasonable, because when you're on Earth, it's hard to say that it's moving, isn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and is the largest of them. The volume of water in it is 8 times greater than in the river, which occupies the second place.
The largest river on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes as wide as six miles.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all water flowing into the oceans from the planet's rivers.
The Amazon River, which is flooded by thousands of smaller rivers, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.
Although the construction of the pyramids using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom era, by the size and technical perfection of the construction, no one was ever able to surpass the Pyramid of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period came in delight with the monuments erected by their ancestors, the age of which at that time exceeded a thousand years.
The Vatican has only about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the least population.
The Italian language is used in the legislation and official reports of the Vatican.
Most of those working in the public sector use Italian as their daily language, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Due to the fact that the basic chemical elements (for example, gold, silver and copper) are found in nature in natural form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools, people knew about them in antiquity.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that claimed that the composition of all things includes one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire and air).
Rather, it looked like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although, according to his theory, they can be transformed into other substances to become what we observe.
In most cases, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium, are considered metals. Of course, there are such metals as silver and gold.
In addition, there are such alloys, which include a small number of non-metallic components. Such a non-metallic component can be, for example, carbon.
Matter is made of everything in the universe. All matter is made of tiny particles — atoms.
The size of the atoms is so small that at the point at the end of this tale, there are trillions of them.
As a result, when the pencil appeared, he became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the importance of the pencil and the frequency of its use decreased as new methods of writing appeared.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, and no one needs a sharpener.
We can only guess what the fate of the keyboard will come up with if it comes to something fundamentally new.
The principle of operation of the plutonium bomb is to use the energy of nuclear synthesis when a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons is formed.
It is supposed to roll on top of a very heavy wheelchair. Re-separation of the core will release some of this energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable. This means that they tend to decay with little or no external influence.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the bark on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side - about 100 km.
Under the moon's dreams, the moon's crust is thinner, and under the highlands, it's thicker.
Moon seas may be more on the nearest side of the moon, because there is a thinner crust, and accordingly, the lava was easier to climb to the surface.
Theories are based on what drives people or what makes them happy.
These theories are based on the fact that people have certain needs and (or) desires, which they turn into internal and to which they give a subjective character (in other words, internalize) during aging.
These theories describe what exactly makes individuals want what they are doing, and what factors in their environment can influence whether they will do certain things.
Butler's "Theory of Hierarchy of Needs" and Herzberg's "Two-Factor Theory" are two authoritative content theories.
In fact, if the heads head their former colleagues, there may be two types of behavior. At one end of the spectrum, there will be attempts to remain "his boyfriend" (or "his girlfriend").
A manager of this type may have difficulty assessing work performance, making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, allocating responsibility, and holding those responsible accountable.
Another extreme is when a person changes beyond recognition — feels the need to change everything that the team has done so far, and assign it to themselves.
Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this type of behavior ends in quarrels between leaders and other team members.
Standards of excellence for regular teams should also be followed by virtual teams, but there are small differences.
Typically, virtual team members perform the role of a contact center for the corresponding real group.
Given that such teams can meet regardless of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may not be clear to local leadership.
Another unique component of distributed virtual command is the presence of a real "invisible command" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The team of leaders, to which each member is subordinate, is the so-called "invisible team". It sets the standards for each member.
For what reason can an organization want to go through a long procedure of forming an educational organization? Innovation is one of the goals of applying organizational learning concepts in practice.
Creativity and ingenuity can be revealed when in the functional departments of the organization all available resources are used efficiently.
Thus, the process used by the organization, whose employees are trying to overcome some obstacle together, can lead to the emergence of a new innovation process that satisfies the client's needs.
The leadership of the organization should create a culture that is characterized by innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational training. Only after that the organization can be called innovative.
In Angel (2006), the Continuous Approach is a method by which organizations can achieve higher efficiency.
The theoretical approach to the study of cognition is supported by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. Thus, the field of study is narrowed and becomes more accurate.
The results of research obtained by scientists are confirmed by the existence of a close relationship between the pathologies of the brain and human behavior.
It has long been known that various types of craniocerebral injuries, focal lesions, formations, plaques, pathological changes and tumors in the brain have an effect on behavior and alter some mental functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to study the structure of the brain and the processes we have not yet known in it.
Thanks to this, we get a huge amount of materials and data to build simulation models that, in turn, help us understand the processes that take place in our minds.
Although the term "artificial intelligence" is usually associated with science fiction, AI is actually a very important branch of computer science that deals with the study of behavior, the learning process, and the intelligent adaptation of computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes attempts to force machines to automate tasks that require machines to behave intelligently.
As an example, we can cite planning and control, the ability to respond to queries and technical problems in customers, as well as to recognize faces, voices and spelling.
They have distinguished themselves into separate disciplines that study real-life problems and offer solutions to them.
Nowadays, AI is often used in the economy, medicine, technical and military spheres. In addition, it is a component of software for some computer programs and video games.
Excursions make up a significant part of school education. Often, the teacher takes the students to such places that it is impossible to reach by bus.
With the help of modern technologies, you can organize virtual excursions. Students can get acquainted with museum exhibits, visit the aquarium or admire the beauty of artworks. All this without leaving the classroom.
Participating in virtual tours together is also a very good way to reflect on the journey and share the experience of the lessons in the future.
Bennett School students in North Carolina, for example, make a website about their trip to the state capital every year and redesign it every year, but the old versions remain online in the form of an album.
In addition, blogging can improve students’ written language. Although at the beginning of blogging, grammar and spelling are often “lame”, this tends to change for the better, thanks to the presence of an audience.
Given that students are usually the most picky audience, the blogger does his best to avoid criticism to improve his style.
In addition, blogging "helps students better understand the world around them". The need to maintain the interest of the audience inspires them and forces them to remain capable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging encourages collaboration and encourages students to learn much more than the traditional school approach offers.
If students use blogs properly, they will "be able to develop analytical and critical thinking skills; an active reaction to online materials will help students to outline their own position to the written by other people, as well as express their own views on individual problems" (Oriv, 2002).
Ottawa is an interesting and charming bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find many art galleries and museums, which give the opportunity to get acquainted with the past of the country and its modernity.
Niagara Falls lies further south, and to the north is Lake Muskoka, famous for its pristine natural beauty.
That is why, and for many other reasons, tourists, visitors and other foreigners consider Ontario a typical Canadian province.
In large parts of its territory, which is further north, there are very few people, and some even represent almost a desert.
For a comparison of the population, one can cite the following fact that many are surprised: the number of African-Americans in the United States exceeds the total number of citizens in Canada.
East African islands are located near the east coast of Africa and belong to the islands of the Indian Ocean.
Undoubtedly, Madagascar is the largest of them. If you talk about wildlife, it can be compared to a separate continent.
Almost all the smaller islands are either independent states, or belong to France. They are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
In addition, the Arabs brought Islam with them to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
The 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, dates to the beginning of European influence and the politics of colonialism.
The northern boundary of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western boundary is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Tourist women are advised to always say that they are married, even if they are not.
In addition, it may be useful to wear a ring (so that it does not look too expensive).
Women need to understand, that as a result of cultural differences, they can face behaviors that will suit them. Local residents can often annoy tourists, hold hands and so on.
Resolutely deny men and boldly defend your opinion (despite cultural differences, it is absolutely unacceptable!).
Modern Casablanca in the 10th century BC was founded by Berber fishermen. Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used this city as a strategic port, which was called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city, and then rebuilt again under the name Casa Branca (White House). After the earthquake of 1755, they left this place.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bajia. The name of Casablanca was given to the city by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Near the Old Town of Medina you can quickly find places where traditional Moroccan products are traded - leather products, pottery, tajiks, hookahs and various toys, but they are all intended exclusively for tourists.
Goma is a city in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near the border with Rwanda, which is popular with tourists.
In 2002, Goma was swept off the face of the earth by lava from the volcano Niiragonga. She buried most of the city streets, mainly in the city center.
Despite the fact that the city of Goma itself is safe enough to go beyond it, it is worth conducting a small investigation to find out if there are any fighting in North Kivu at some point.
In addition, the city serves as a base for climbing the Niiragonga volcano. It also offers very cheap services for lovers of mountain gorillas — more attractive prices in Africa are difficult to find.
To get around Goma, you can take a body-body (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of the comparative inaccessibility of Tambuktu, its name began to be used as a metaphor for denoting distant exotic places.
Despite the reputation of tourist attractions and the presence of the airport, today Timbuktu is a city that is dominated by poverty.
In 1990, due to the threat from the sands of the desert, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites that are in danger.
Henry Louis Gates paid much attention to this city in the PBS channel program "Miracles of the African Continent".
Compared to other cities in the country, the city stands out even more because it has more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (NPK) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa. To the east it borders with Mozambique, to the north — with Zimbabwe, and along the river Crocodile passes its southern border.
The area of the park is 19 500 km2. It has 14 ecozone, each of which lives different animals and grow different plants.
It is one of the most interesting places in the country, and is also considered the most significant of the National Parks of South Africa.
As in all the national parks of South Africa, the park charges an entrance fee every day and collects an environmental fee from visitors.
In addition, it may be profitable to purchase the so-called Wild Card — a subscription that gives the right to visit several parks in South Africa or all the national parks of South Africa.
The name of the country Hong Kong is borrowed from the island of Hong Kong, which is a center of attraction for many tourists.
The beautiful buildings of Hong Kong, which form the architectural face of the city, are compared to a brilliant column diagram, and the waters of the Victoria Harbour only emphasize its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong can be enjoyed if you leave the island and head to the Kowloon Riverfront.
Much of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly located along the northern coast on drained land.
In the past, this place was captured by colonialists from the United Kingdom, so if you want to see for yourself the evidence of the colonial past of the country, then you need to start from here.
The Sundarban Forest is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) off the coast deep into Bangladesh and inland India.
UNESCO has declared Sundarban a World Heritage Site. The name "Sundarban National Park" carries that part of the forest, which is located in the territory of India.
Not only are mangrove swamps called forests, they are also some of the last deaf jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain and still survive.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which reservoirs or swamps occupy about one-third.
The Sundarban Forest has been a wildlife reserve since 1966, and currently there are reportedly 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 spotted reindeer in the region.
From the inter-district bus station (which is located behind the river) buses depart throughout the day. However, in most cases they leave between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Jakar (which is in the Bumtang area).
Due to the fact that intercity buses are often crowded, tickets are recommended to buy a couple of days before the trip.
Convenient and reliable small coaster buses produced in Japan serve most areas.
A taxi route is a comfortable and convenient way to get to nearby places, for example, to the cities of Punakha (passenger fare is 200 ngultrums) and Paro (passenger fare is 150 ngultrums).
The bridge overlooking Ajapák is an outlet. It connects the banks of the river Ajapák, on which are located two cities - Ajapák (Brazil) and Saint-Georges-de-Louapák (French Guiana).
The height of the two pylons is 83 meters. The length of the bridge — 378 meters. The carriageway consists of two lanes, the width of each — 3.50 m.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. For traffic, the bridge was opened only in March 2017, despite the fact that its construction was completed in August 2011.
According to the schedule, the bridge will become fully functional in September 2017, after the completion of the construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
Guarani, who led the life of semi-swinging hunters and also engaged in natural agriculture, were the most significant group of indigenous people inhabiting the territory of modern Eastern Paraguay.
Other indigenous groups, such as the pajagua and the guicuru, lived in the Chaca region. To survive, they engaged in hunting, fishing and collecting.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India", actually emerged in the 16th century when Spanish conquerors met with indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards began a three-hundred-year period of colonization.
Paraguay has been able to maintain its identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the world's best teams and gender players.
