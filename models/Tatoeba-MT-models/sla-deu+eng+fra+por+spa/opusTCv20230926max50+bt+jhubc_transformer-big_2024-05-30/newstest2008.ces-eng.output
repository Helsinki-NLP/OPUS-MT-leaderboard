Inflation rises in Europe due to food
Accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
November price growth in 13 eurozone countries was higher than expected, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent after 2.6 percent in October, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union said.
The official forecast was only 3%, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the basic interest rate, with the reduction, along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, leading to an inflation spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation rates below 2%, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must "dissuade" inflation so that it does not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, inflation of 3.3 percent in November was a 15-year record; in Spain, it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has spilled upwards due to sharply rising food and energy prices.
Wheat prices rose by 88 percent, and soybeans reached their highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil in the world markets this year rose by 52 percent and last month already cost one barrel of black gold almost $ 100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 percent in 2008 to 2.5 percent this year, but it will fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation in the next 3-4 months will remain at about 3 percent, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice over the course of 2008.
Gallup Sees Government Crisis
The Fidesz movement's supporters have grown significantly after a prolonged stagnation at the beginning of December, and so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the socialists, the Gallup Institute has never measured such low - 13 percent support.
In the case of certain voters of the party, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would amount to more than two-thirds (71 percent) of the support compared to a fifth of the support of the MSZP.
According to the poll, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament: their support within the entire population is 2%.
Among some voters of the party, supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has also deteriorated due to the previous minimum - the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be extremely bad has never been so high - 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
Families assess the change in their material situation after the spring and summer promising prospects are now again more pessimistic.
As for next year, the greater part of the population counts with further deterioration and only a tenth with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those surveyed, the most polled so far by the Gallup Institute, judged the prime minister to be doing his job poorly rather than well.
Ferenc Gyurcsány believes or very much believes 13 percent of the respondents, while Viktor Orbán’s share of supporters is 38 percent.
The prime minister is not trusted by 54% and the Fidesz leader by 27%.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be resolved without a change of government.
After last October’s unrest, 35 per cent considered staying in the government and the prime minister desirable, now that share is only 20 per cent, with a relative majority (33 per cent) seeing the solution only in calling new elections.
For interest in the referendum, it is significant that 60 percent of respondents answered a question about their possible participation, that the referendum would definitely come, and another 20 percent said that it would probably come.
By comparison, "the parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly only be attended by 55 percent, and another 15 percent consider their participation to be likely. The success of the referendum would be unquestionable on the basis of current intentions.
A schoolboy would say no to 74, a doctor's fee to 79, and a hospital fee to 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people who certainly promise their participation, then the introduction of tuition, doctor's fees and hospital fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth more expensive than Tesco
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained an average of 16% increase in the price level last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Newspaper Napi Gazdaság
The usual Napi Gazdaság Christmas shopping basket in the Budaörs trade triangle grew by an average of 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets, the price showed an increase of more than a thousand forints.
Since prices in food supermarkets "soared" in December last year, there was not such a drastic increase in percentage due to the previous high base.
However, it is certainly disappointing for consumers that what they could have bought last year at a price of less than nine thousand forints, they will not buy now even for ten thousand.
The daily consumption basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumption basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unico and live fish remained almost at last year’s level, but very expensive cruel breasts, nuts and also poppy.
The prices of bread and flour were consistent with the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread even for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
Similarly, it was surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter Coca Cola in a returnable bottle was below 200 forints, so even with a deposit, the product cost only 257 forints.
This year, however, the Napi Gazdaság Auchan appeared to be the most expensive, while the Cora appeared to be the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices in the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket rose by 15 percent compared to last year’s prices at Christmas, while Tesco and Auchan raised by about 18 percent.
When comparing last year’s highest and this year’s lowest consumption basket values, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest was 21 percent.
On average, the increase in forints was 1,480.
The average price increase last year was 1,206 forints, with prices affected by VAT growth last Christmas.
It was this process that disrupted trade, and it was evident that the department stores could not decide how large a price range they were to set for each product, as they could not predict the effect that the change in prices would have on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of circulation of a given product, a significant profit may be lost due to the price range adjusted to the intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT last year, the rise in the price of the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the price difference for the cheapest one was 844 forints.
This year, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest one rose by 1,284 forints.
When comparing the two Christmas seasons, the price increases were catastrophic, with daily commodities in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, among other things, is not entirely confirmed by the Central Statistical Office’s data: it has measured a price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months for several basic foods.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the Daily Economy consumption basket, this seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, already quite expensive last year, showed, given the basis, even in the worst case, a price increase of barely more than 10 percent.
Flour suppliers appear to be in a stronger position than egg suppliers, with drastic price increases in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the trading golden triangle are not complaining, they are still reporting on a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-term food after pay.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets had long queues at cash desks, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, in rural areas, turnover is lower, with multiple international chains complaining to research firms that sales are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
Saving on disinfectants in many places
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection were registered in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overload of staff stopping diseases do not help, says the Primary of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, they also save on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John’s Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found in a man who was admitted to hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but shortly afterwards he had to return with an MRSA infection and because of the bacteria in his body, one important operation could not be performed.
As of December 10, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been reported to the National Nesocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröczová, head of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been safely registered in hospitals, others are unknown.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant golden staphylococcus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by a third of people in the nose without causing disease.
SA infections (e.g. cervical inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, morning infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be well treated.
However, when antibiotics are administered excessively or inappropriately, a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics develops into a bacteria that is highly resistant to antibiotics and that spreads rapidly in unsuitable hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of temporary or permanent poor functioning of the immune system in patients with a weakened body, low body weight or in patients in old age, it can cause serious hospital infections, for example, morning infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the chief physician of St. John’s Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections belong to daily practice in hospitals.
"The infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not just there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the disease agent is not investigated."
Resistant to antibiotics
"We are isolating these patients, treating them with rubber gloves and masks, and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined to see if MRSA is present in their body, but infection can not always be avoided.
Sampling is out of fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not favorable for the prevention of the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection is common in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should check patients and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, microbiological sampling in Hungarian hospitals is not in vogue.
The National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases are detected if the patient is suffering from a noticeable MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or microbiological tests should be carried out, in order to prevent the development of drug resistance, but even hospitals do not comply with this in all cases.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in primary and outpatient care, Karolina Böröczová said.
Saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most often spread among patients through medical personnel.
Therefore, hand washing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and touch, but in home hospitals it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
As Karolina Böröczová noted, unfortunately, we can also see that in hospitals that are in an unfavourable material situation, there is a saving on disinfectants, there are few nurses and a lot of patients, which increases the chances of infection.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are observed, such infections are shown to be less or the further spread of the disease agent can be stopped.
Government Program against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is combated everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written a program to prevent or reduce MRSA.
As the programme appears to be successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England are showing a declining trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) prioritises the prevention of MRSA and hospital infections caused by MRSA.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion in the case of the police captain of the XXII district, who caused the fatal accident, is finished.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and resigned in the meantime, would be driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office of the capital, said on Friday after an expert assessment of the case was finalized.
An expert opinion confirmed the outcome of the initial investigation, which had already concluded that the former police captain had not drunk alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The then director of the police directorate of the XXII district on Tuesday in the street Lajos Kossuth in the XXII district crashed his own personal car when turning a fifty-five-year-old man, who stepped in front of him as he crossed the road outside the marked crossing.
(The last mentioned fact that the pedestrian crossed beyond the zebra, by the way, according to the rules of the road is not an attenuating circumstance, the turning car must still give priority.)
After being transported to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Due to these events, the district police director resigned and requested a retirement, according to police reports, because he was so shocked by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been cooperating with the prosecutors conducting the investigations from the beginning.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks worth a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed on Friday in Budapest by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects supported by the Cohesion Fund, with the parties having previously concluded a loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million, the contract now signed covering the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
A loan agreement worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million is also used to finance budgetary projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million may occur later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract for 50 million euros, which the budget will use primarily for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also a discussion about the 4th subway line.
The parties agreed that after Hungary agrees with the EU on the details of the financing of the subway, they will return to whether and how the original treaty needs to be modified.
This could happen in the first quarter of 2008, according to János Veres.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded a total of 113 projects in Hungary with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
Interest on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment commission shall be linked to the Euribor rate.
Bulgaria is a real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is overwhelming - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the formerly somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying on the EU’s currently cheapest but rapidly rising market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after East European destination for property purchases is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast.
Of the mountains, the most popular are the areas of Bansko, Borovets, Pamprovo and Vitosha, on the sea coast Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Beach, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country - for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of investors, and more and more people are shopping in the vicinity of the extremely cheap city of Ruse.
Also, the capital of Sofia is a promise of enticing opportunities, business and office space promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, becoming a sought-after destination in addition to the summer and winter seasons in the next two seasons.
Predictive investors are already buying in large quantities, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, property buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most of the customers come from England, but there are also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, and there are traditionally many Russian customers in the Black Sea and in the ski paradises.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgiy Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settling people buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or decayed old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication possibilities, the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor is important for them.
The second category is chat buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors, who buy in the hope of an increase in value in the medium or long term.
The price increase in real estate in the capital is continuous, as demand is growing stronger.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, but has grown by 21% annually over the past five years.
The increase in property prices far outweighs the increase in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to the Minister of Environment and Water, Gábor Fodor, meetings of experts will be closed on Tuesday, and after the official opening on Wednesday, the international conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue with ministerial talks.
Experts and policymakers from 192 countries are negotiating the Bali Roadmap, which addresses efforts following the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, there is a heated debate about them between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not want to negotiate exact figures now, although it is in favour of an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big question for the conference is whether the developed countries will agree, in addition to reducing emissions, to provide both material and technological assistance to the countries that rely on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member Steering Board, most likely within the framework of the UN World Environment Programme (GEF) - we can read in the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungarian 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Water Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leadership in global climate protection efforts and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and is ready to commit to up to 30 percent reductions if other developed regions of the world, or developed countries, are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments appropriate to their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set themselves the goal of a reduction of 5.2%, while the then 15 EU member states committed to 8%.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87, which our country will fulfill.
There is a lot going on in Bali, because an international agreement on a long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would certainly be postponed until 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new emission reduction system, the need for which is also highlighted in its latest report by the international scientific council of the UN, which is concerned only with climate change.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and inevitably increase the average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British army is recruiting on YouTube
British troops are posting videos of events in Iraq and Afghanistan on a video-sharing server, which they use to popularize themselves.
First, YouTube became popular with the British Air Force (RAF): special forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of anti-Taliban operations since March 2006.
The recordings, taken with a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are inspected by the Air Force Command controlling combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is unavoidable.
In this form, 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers have already been made on the Internet, and their "channel" has already been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force has released videos according to its original intent for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good for acquaintance of the general public with the real purpose of the military presence abroad.
“The promotion published in this form costs little compared to traditional television recruitment ads,” said defense expert Gordon Mackenzie, “but it also necessarily carries a certain political message, as it confirms in a special way the legitimacy of the military actions decided by the government.”
The Americans made the game.
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos, for example, depicting the deaths of soldiers, are also being uploaded to the server: in somewhat hypocritical, "official" promotional films, officers talk about losses at the most, but the bloody form of the fight is not shown.
Many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during the sharp deployment, have already been made available on the Internet, but the British army has only now discovered them.
Americans recruit a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can, through a more or less faithful simulation, get directly into the skin of the soldiers.
At the ministries there will be Christmas with raffle and pagá<0xC4><0x8D>ky
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperthová seems not to be sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her co-workers, where she will say goodbye to pagá<0xC4><0x8D>ky and coffee from 2007.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, in others it will conjure up the Christmas atmosphere with a raffle and a toast.
The party, the Christmas atmosphere, the concerts and the buffet - that's how the powerful have fun.
Government agencies are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year will be held by the Ministry of Defense, but it does not expect its employees.
At the Christmas of the orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, at the Mission Christmas family members of the soldiers currently serving on foreign missions will host them, but they will also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort devotes 25 million to the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MTE) will be kicking themselves out of the box compared to other departments.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jöv<0xC5><0x91> Háza, for a total of 4,320,000 forints and approximately three hundred fifty guests are expected from the six hundred employees of the Ministry.
At its celebration, the resort will stick to Christmas traditions, but there will also be various performances and raffles.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday at the State Council of Justice (OIT) - concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
Renting the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one of the NFÜ departments is invited to another Christmas celebration: the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU funds will host the tendering firm.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the Vígszínház Theatre.
MAG a. s. has not confirmed this information, as we have not been able to reach the person concerned.
Clothes are not needed
The OIT building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the St. Lucia Ball on December 7th instead of Christmas.
However, she did not want money from him for the use of her halls.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The party began with a toast to the minister, after dinner it was possible to dance accompanied by live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball there was no mandatory evening dress or suit at all.
The Puritan party is organized by the departments of health, labor and local governments.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Labour Minister Mónica Lamperth officially does not invite co-workers to the Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are counted, who, according to the press department, will receive only coffee and pagá<0xC4><0x8D>ky, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
The Minister of Local Self-Government Gordon Bajnai and his associates will simply drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Self-Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas gathering, at which 436 workers are expected, in its own large hall.
For the Christmas party, he spends 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a buffet reception and a toast.
Since being Minister János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be lacking, the officialness is enhanced not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time.
The Department of Agriculture holds a New Year's reception on January 20, ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place at the Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the Municipal Gardens and, according to the Ministry, there are 1,000 forints per person for one hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short toast to the minister and end with a small treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold Christmas parties at all, the relevant press department told the portal [origo].
The award of the Christmas celebrations of the Ministry of the Environment in the press department could not be announced.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to the party held at the Artistic and Industrial Museum.
It's about to go on a huge strike
The League of Trade Unions, or the National Union of Workers' Councils (MOSZ), will set up its strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's unrestricted strike.
A protest public assembly will be held on Saturday, and work will be stopped on Monday - the day of the final vote on the health insurance law.
The action will certainly cause serious traffic interruptions, as rail transport will almost completely stop and the employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike by 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League and the National Union of Workers' Councils will present the details of the joint Monday strike.
There will also be a LEAGUE-MOSZ strike committee, which will coordinate Monday's event.
A protest public assembly is held on Saturday, and from Monday, unions joining the strike will suspend work indefinitely unless a deal is reached with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the law on health insurance.
If Parliament does not finally pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the legislation is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next step.
According to Monday's agenda of Parliament's meeting, it is also possible that the health insurance law will not be voted on until late in the evening or late at night.
Due to the start of the strike on Monday, serious traffic interruptions can be expected: work on the railways will be stopped indefinitely, in the morning part of Budapest's public transport and more than half of Volán's companies may stop.
At the same time, in many places of the country, half the track will also be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the call to strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced an indefinite strike, others announced a temporary suspension of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (M<0xC3><0x81>V) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient services, with more and more people travelling by rail at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to the previous announcements, from the start of operation until 13:00, there will be a strike at BKV, from 7 to 9:00 at the Budapest Airport company, a four-hour strike will be organized by the Trade Unions of Workers in the Energy Industry LIGA, the Trade Union of Educators and the Democratic Trade Union of Educators called for a 2-, respectively 2-8-hour stoppage of work.
The Union of Hungarian Physicians will strike alternately across the country, while the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), a member of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is for the government to withdraw the health insurance reform proposal and submit a new concept for public debate.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions applicable from next year should be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, to ensure the possibility of early retirement for the relevant occupations before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), which belongs to the League trade union, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning railway branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of the country
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
In the "risk warning" prepared by the company, it is written: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "the aggravation of already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma populations of Hungary may soon lead to violent ethnic clashes".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy is likely to provoke such an action, the research institute adds.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the biggest negligences of Hungarian political leaders: "the public discussion of the Roma issue was left to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy on the Romani-Hungarian contradiction."
This deepens the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, under the influence of the great attention of domestic and foreign media, "to a large extent spoiled the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of faith in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity".
The Institute recalls that part of the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and far-right groups, which has been gaining increasing publicity and vehemence since autumn 2006, is that several organizations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which themselves call themselves "national militia" associations.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly proclaiming - even armed - the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in case of natural disasters, invasion of the country, disorder of order), in addition to pointing to the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
All of this is done in a way that seeks to wrap all sorts of political endeavors built on society’s opposition to politics and parties in civilian garb.
Emphasis on civility and the form of the association in the case of these groups serves not only to avoid the legal pitfalls of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been pointed out in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, while ultranationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries have sought to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policies by invoking the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this can affect the political stability of the region,” he added.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, so the political risks to the region as a whole have increased.
As he writes, the activity of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Behind the creation of the Bulgarian Guard stands the mass Roma riots that broke out in one of the districts of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used it to set up the Guards, claiming that the organization’s goal was “national militia”.
For the past 17 years, according to her, there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained idle and indifferent, according to the Institute of Political Capital.
He added that the initiative sparked a heated debate among the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will create their own guard as a sign of resistance.
Since the activity of the Hungarian Guard so far shows similarities with the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma will react to the threat in a similar way, by setting up their own militia, we can read in the warning on risks prepared by the Institute of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of the Political Capital Institute, said: “Risk analysis is one of the research institute’s activities.
As he said, the risk analysis is issued every year and if they find something that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not free everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are precisely defined by law and it has become common practice to move working days around holidays, which is less common next year.
There is no uniform holiday in the European Union or the United States.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and national holidays and days of rest.
Days of rest are usually associated with church holidays or important historical events.
In our country, we also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a work holiday - on New Year's already so that people can rest after New Year's Eve.
There are eleven free holidays throughout the year.
The national holiday is March 15, celebrating the revolution of 1848, and October 23, the day of the revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August we celebrate the founding of the state, on the 1st of May we celebrate the work, on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, Easter, Pentecost and Christmas are two-day holidays.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend according to the calendar, it has become a practice to move the working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after a holiday.
However, the price for extended weekends is that we stay in the workplace and at school the previous Saturdays.
The day immediately preceding or following the holiday has been regulated by the Minister of Labour in a special decree for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and workers employed by them, to public servants and to persons in the public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or, taking into account their destination, operate even on days of rest.
This year, there will be a change in the working conditions only around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because according to previous experience, most people "work" in advance the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve or thus take advantage of the holidays saved.
Next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar changes around Labor Day, so that workers can then stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday, April 26th, will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2nd, can be a day of rest.
The next move is related to the holiday of October 23: Saturday, October 18, will be working instead of Friday, October 24.
By the end of next year, however, it will be possible to take place entirely under the sign of holidays, because from December 24, almost everywhere will have nonstop holidays, even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
6 Things You Can Do to Annoy Your Colleagues
The emails we forget to send, the voicemails we never receive, the innocent lies we barely notice anymore: all of this “makes” our everyday lives at the workplace more diverse.
The question is whether you get used to these minor inconveniences, or put on gloves and unclear situations that can make others angry, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that the marketing department was looking for you," a colleague tells you.
That you missed a meeting for that?
In the best case, he regrets it and will try to fix it, or call the marketing department and say that he forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, the issue is solved with an apology.
Before you make an awkward apology, it’s a good idea to think about what you can do to prepare awkward moments for your colleagues and consciously try to avoid it.
Are you borrowing something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more annoying than when you reach out for a piece of paper, an office item, or your phone, and they’re not there.
Do you remember putting a stapler on your desk yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you find a pen on the desk of one of your colleagues that you thought was lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they will be rightfully angry with you for digging into their things.
Do not take envelopes or glue papers out of the office, as they can be annoying if you run out prematurely and you will need them immediately.
Gossip about the private life of colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the spread of rumors.
Who, who, what was he doing?
Where and why?
Don’t tell anyone about your friends’ private lives!
When one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in what you have heard, and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even if others know about his things.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and report your absence because you’re not feeling well, or think you’d rather rest today, think that someone else will have to do your job, urgent tasks, and the work that they have a certain deadline for you.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not be going to work the next day, or that something may happen that will make you stay home, report it so that your colleagues and managers will not be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Brushing, giggling, phoning
Have you been immersed in a job from which you are rudely pulled out by the giggling of colleagues?
Have you inadvertently witnessed a telephone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not disturb your co-workers with murmurings, chanting, loud talk (overhead), or treading, constant cursing, loud dissatisfaction.
All this can be disturbing even when they are not prevented from a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for the mistakes?
If something is not on time or you forgot to send an important letter or message, do not blame your forgetfulness on others!
Do not appeal to any chaos reigning in the office and noisy colleagues!
Admit if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and fix the damage!
Ask how you can fix things, correct negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Pants and slippers: comfortable clothes for home, but not for the office!
Do not wear casual clothes, even if your profession allows it!
Do not be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in ordinary clothes - and if your profession requires it, nicely and elegantly!
When a man wants to please, he ceases to be interesting
Driving in the usual morning traffic jam.
A special melody echoes from the radio: the sound of the violin, to which electronic effects are attached.
Adding volume.
The music changes pace and the previous tonal colors are added to the bass, then the female choir joins as a real jewel.
Zagar's song is called Wings of Love.
Home music life has not pampered us for a long time with high-quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, the congestion looks quite different, because you are listening to Zagara's new album.
The emergence of Yonderboie, a couple of new and exciting productions coming from the home digital underground, is slowly changing the overall picture, and although garage rock is once again in vogue with its beating into the guitar, even home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the Pentateuch, and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until eventually - perhaps because two pacifiers couldn't fit into the same box - he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through only when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film Ferenc Török "Szezon").
His formations, playing initially in smaller clubs, met a wider audience after wan2 ranked their first album of 2002 among the 50 most important home albums and declared Zagar at Yonderboie as almost the only domestic entity determining developments that could be sold even in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "on course", although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this label.
The band reacted as it should: they made a new, better album.
A now-released album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new avenues for them, although the title itself seeks to make a follow-up to the early years in the Pentateuch.
This is one verse from the song of the old band Balázs Zságer.
A reference to ethereal, flying would have been appropriate, but besides the ethereal touch of this music, there was now - in line with the spirit, the trend of the time - a louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, presented at the premiere of the album in Millénaris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, playing popular music lately from morning to evening, we began to stick to the flamboyant melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So all is well (?).
The portal hvg.hu interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question arises, how long does what you play remain marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of marginal music does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don’t say anything, and just like that it can only be made for sale, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can come from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as it is adopted works, regardless of language and state borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially from us to the west, light music has a larger tradition.
Not only teenagers and people in their twenties go to concerts there, but also the elderly.
They are much more interested in the transformations of light music taking place around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where and how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling that more and more people come to our concerts.
But we've never made music for the market.
Music is not made for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived rather at concerts, where mutual influence already works, but it is hidden only in the intangible transformations of the moment.
Still, I noticed that when a person wants to please the audience, he ceases to be interesting from that moment on.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow Yonderboie’s example?
He works solo and has built his career more from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We do not actually follow his path, regardless of the fact that they sometimes try to explain our music in this way.
We are more like team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first, of course, we could not avoid comparing our work to Yonderboi’s compositions, because several of us separated from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love came first on the top list of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, did you consciously open up to the broader strata?
B.Zs.: We did not plan to write a hit to sell the album.
There's more to this song.
We intended it as the finale of the album, trying to unleash the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
HVG: How did you choose those six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then came the idea to assemble this choir from female soloists of the domestic music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member choir came together - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then renamed Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that how you intended the song, or did the girls make something out of it?
B.Zs.: The composition has long existed in the instrumental version, when the material on the record was then gathered, we thought that something else would be needed for this composition.
The chord sequence was tempting the singing part to join him.
That day at night, I sang a melody to him, which the girls later learned.
It all came out almost the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it brought it to life, but of course it took Diva.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked that energetically.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, it seemed that the girls were in the background.
They don't have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have a role of their own, they sing completely together, and they're not louder than music, so music just doesn't accompany their singing.
They were in the back, too.
Is that intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
On the contrary, the fact that we did not want to divide the solo roles is intentional.
The song is also about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where we come from, where we belong, and just allowing ourselves to be lifted up by those wings, the wings of love.
I wish that this euphoric state, which we felt when the song was born, was felt by others.
hvg.hu: What was the most work?
B.Zs.: While composing the music, not a single, heavier pieces occurred during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he did not want to work groove, then everything slowly found its place as in a jigsaw puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This is constantly changing with the concert and the fact that I have already "released" the record.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous broker risked billions of dollars of inferiority
A treacherous swindler.
This is how he describes his cowardly employee Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Komer<0xC4><0x8D>ní banka.
Because of it, it lost almost five billion euros.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to cope with his colleagues and, besides, certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized early the crisis in the US mortgage market.
'He's mentally weak, 'said his superiors, who sent the police after him.
But according to Kerviel’s statement from French media outlets such as Le Monde, he was a man who made <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion in profits at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros from the US crisis.
He saw the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who have had repayment problems in the past, will be in trouble.
This crisis should not have had an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet right.
At the end of the year, its profit rose to 1.6 billion euros.
"I didn't know how to announce it when I made my first half-billion," Kerviel admits, adding that he hasn't kept anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he forged the records so that he would not be discovered.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex exchange became interested in his trades.
Risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd be found out?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get the will to take such a risk?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $ 90,000.
He knew he would never make as much money as anyone else.
“I knew from my first interview in 2005 that they were looking at me.
For my education, as well as for my professional and personal development,” Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after the start came the first big success.
Thanks to the shares, Allianz made a profit, because in the bombings on London, he bet on the decline of this title half a billion euros.
And that was the trigger mechanism -- he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew, or rather, they knew.
"As long as I was making money, they were closing their eyes."
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to wipe it out.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days for the past year.
A broker who has no leave is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look into his records,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government and the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic can receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around CZK 100 billion from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage the amount of CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is designed to serve entrepreneurs and businesses to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in terms of the use of EU funds so far.
20-year sentence for Nicaragua's ex-president confirmed by court
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former president Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of $100 million in financial fraud.
He was later released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether the former head of the Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to prison is unclear at this time.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials whether they let Aleman serve his sentence at home or go to jail.
Four years ago, a court found that Alemán regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of that money then ended up in a fund that Alemán set up to fund his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved the budget.
That's right. I'm sorry.
The state budget was approved.
What makes this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget drawn up by the government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year it passed with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because Minister Sobotka prepared it and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the heated debate before the no-confidence vote, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies passed the law, which was traditionally overlooked, although the most influential one, peacefully.
It's a paradox.
Every government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government’s power rivalry with the opposition.
This is more media-grateful and that is why much more attention is paid to it in the media.
Guessing politicians is more interesting to the public than rigorous numbers.
State budgets in past social democratic governments suffered from three ailments that for 2008 it is unable to solve all at once:
The first of these is the high share of statutory mandatory, so-called mandatory expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year before the elections by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is deficit management as a result of the disease of the first.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
But the time bomb is the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in order to obtain additional resources for investment in addition to money from taxes, fees, and loans from banks, often recklessly issued bonds that unreasonably indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other grids they received from the state in privatization.
They no longer have that resource.
If we stick only to the official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as well as the rest of the world, which is why the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is constantly boasting.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the state became increasingly indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more intelligently than our republic.
This is a huge disgrace, which falls mainly on past governments.
We are among the countries that are least at risk of poverty globally.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, in recent years have completely unnecessarily swelled to gigantic dimensions.
Although some of the nonsensical populist spending approved before the elections this year has been abolished, if the retirement and pension reform thresholds are not pushed forward in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and whoever rules it will be mere office.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically distributing the majority of taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only suspend the squeezing of normal expenditure by mandatory expenditure.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely useless if past governments did not manage as much as they could in the last ten years.
If we do not really want the ruling politicians to become mere officials, then we must be patient and indulge this not too strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can spend only as much as it can get on taxes and fees, peace of mind for the preparation of further reform laws.
This is the only way to achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to work together to combat the financial market crisis.
More than $100 billion will enter the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks auction the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the Fed will auction $40 billion and make another $24 billion available to the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the September 11 attacks that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This move is intended to address the biggest challenge of the economy, the growing shortage of free capital that banks could lend,” said Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group in a statement to clients.
“Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl said in a statement.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect billions of dollars in losses.
“Central banks must really be afraid of what may come next when they decide to do so,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will also lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with possible impacts on global economic growth.
Central banks made the decision after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used for lending money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about lending money to each other, despite the fact that the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as a further fall in interest rates," Tempus Consulting's Greg Salvaggio told Reuters.
Some analysts do not think that the move of central banks will contribute to averting the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem, which is the collapse of the US real estate market.
Ecological debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is expected to hurt developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus once again commented on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been brought down at the ending UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, Not Green Planet, he said the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality, unacceptable.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a fireworks display of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech president stressed that its topic is very important for him and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book appeared in the German translation, because, as he said, "I often encounter only caricatures of my opinions".
So now those interested can read his undistorted attitudes.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he believed that he had sufficient prerequisites for writing such a book.
He is an academic, capable of following and judging scientific treatises, has experience in statistics and is also a national economist.
The main conclusions of the book are the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus on the warming of the planet by all scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely expensive.
Moreover, as a person with totalitarian experience, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He said he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against a militant environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver’s license could not be exchanged for 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that people can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can still issue a new card by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the road without a valid license after the New Year.
According to the authorities, the card was not exchanged mainly by those who no longer want to drive.
While municipalities are reporting a sharp decline in interest in the change of driver's license, authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed by applications and interest in the change of license has increased this week.
The municipality handles about 2000 clients per day.
They waited in the queues for about half an hour.
Approximately 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licences in Prague.
The issuance of a new card takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay 500 crowns.
Motorcyclists who fail to change their licenses before the end of the year and leave the country without a valid driver's license will face a fine from January.
The offender shall pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
A police officer can also deal with the offense by collusion.
In the case of an administrative offense, the fine will rise to CZK 2,500.
According to earlier information, even a person who is not going anywhere could receive a fine from the town hall.
He was reportedly able to pay 30,000 crowns.
The ministry earlier called on the authorities to be moderate and impose a maximum fine of CZK 1,000.
According to Karel Hanzelka, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport, there is no risk of a 10,000-dollar fine.
A driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an ID card that everyone has to have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driving license.
It is enough to take it away or send it by registered mail to the competent municipal authority.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid.
Motorists will also need to change their driving licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the sentences of detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, who are accused of criminal association with the David Berdych gang, will go to jail for thirteen and ten years.
The Prague Supreme Court decided to reduce their sentences by one year and the other by two years.
Originally, it threatened the detectives of Prague’s Department for Combating Organized Crime for 14 and 12 years.
Today’s decision can no longer be appealed, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also indicted in the case, but awaits a first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already received sentences totaling more than 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the Regional Court found 19 people guilty of involvement in robbery, the Supreme Court considered appeals of 16 of them today.
Most of the defendants rejected the indictment from the beginning of the investigation, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, handed over information from police sources to criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang gave 30 percent for Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík.
The indictment alleges gang activity from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious injuries, but also abuse of public authority and illicit armament.
During house searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, steel-core missiles, a laser sighting device or a machine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang robbed tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly twenty men in the process, the courts have already found Berdych and many others guilty of other robberies.
Other men from the Berdych area are still confessing before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived before the court.
So far, the main trial has avoided Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pót and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish detention, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic for prosecution.
Children's Substitution Bill: 12 million
For the substitution of children in the maternity hospital, Igor Veleba, the lawyer of the injured families, wants to compensate the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital for CZK 12 million, plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the father two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, therefore disagrees fundamentally with Veleby’s proposal.
"We reject such a request, it's very, very high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"But in order to be able to make an opinion on the counterproposal, we need an expert opinion, which the counterparty has prepared.
Let’s see if it has any value.
But we remain of the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for all,” he said.
According to him, the amount should range from 100,000 to 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov wanted a million crowns for each month when they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba served as a basis for negotiations on compensation expert opinion, which was prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motola.
Parents of children, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological harm and stress at varying degrees and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, even though they faced remorse for not preventing the confusion of newborns.
Women, in turn, are less comfortable with the actuality of the trauma experienced, and with what is happening right now, summarized the contents of Veleba.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> maternity hospital last December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Cermak family in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vyst<0xC4><0x9B><0xC4><0x8D>il, the head of the Highlands, handed over 100,000 crowns to each of the families at the end of October to compensate for the expenses incurred due to the mistake of the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital, which the region is establishing.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In the event of an error, they must reach the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask for the help of the founder.
So far, the courts have granted relatively low compensation to people, the amounts were calculated according to the tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup lost the Kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polivka lost the dispute over the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, the designation was used for the first time by the Wallachian king, but the project was built by a long-term team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who worked with the actor.
Soup was not present today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasitizing Bolko Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Wallachia remind everyone of actors and comedians.
Harabish is of the same opinion.
“We have almost a decade of work behind us.
“Getting money and making things happen,” he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was a success and that it could benefit from it.
They want to parasitize our work,” he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the name was first used by the Wallachian king in his TV show.
In 1993, it was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
At that time, however, it had nothing to do with the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionary action turned out to be trade and lucrative entrepreneurial activity, to which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then followed the foundation of the Wallachian Kingdom Company.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to include his name and signature in the passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the bare idea that Polívka published in the maneuver for his entrepreneurial intention.
"Boleslav Polívka's popularity of the Wallachian Kingdom project certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who devoted themselves to it intensively.
The cooperation of the now-disputed parties continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected to the throne".
Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková took the lead role in the kingdom at the initiative of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>a as the queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court dismissed today.
Clearly, the dispute could bring Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>'s upcoming quest for the throne and half a princess.
A new king should come out of him.
Details and deadlines have not yet been revealed.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like a ride of kings in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Soup can sign up," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: vanishing prejudices
In fact, I've never really been a fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of shifting, steering and also production could sometimes be called below average.
But there is now a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is much better.
And the station wagon called SW goes a little further and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about the headroom in the rear seats.
This is the end of the complaint, because the body of the van means that even two-meter-long cars will not suffer in this direction.
Flying around the world
I will go through the interior very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is quite a successful design, where the only reproach I have to the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design invention, when the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The lateral line also improved significantly compared to the 206.
In terms of space, there is also an increase in body dimensions.
In the van then disappears the already mentioned lack of space above your head.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main thing in this car is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate it as very easily accessible (even thanks to the tilting rear window) and as decently stored.
Deaf spots are equipped with restraint rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, they can be stretched while holding even heavier objects.
But let's pause on the volume together.
According to the tables in the basic layout, it is 428 liters, which is more an average value against the competition.
But not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot is lagging behind by a lot of noticeable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is even critical.
But if I have to pick up the positives, then I still have to mention a completely flat floor after folding the backrests of the second row or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a 1.6 litre four-cylinder petrol engine with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-stroke family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, has little consumption and, above all, pulls.
If I compare it to the <0xC5><0xA0>koda equivalent, which sometimes acts as if it has a stuffed rag in the exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
Price list will tell
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must remember that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a petrol fourteen hundred for 329 900 CZK will still pass.
Our aggregate costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment will then add equipment for an additional CZK 80,000.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic start of wipers, electric control of rear windows...
The car costs 531,900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count the additional equipment at Fabia and you will come to a lot of similar numbers.
So there is no choice but to choose a brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
There are more children from Eastern European countries in British schools, which raises concerns among local residents about the further development of local education.
So far, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles.
British schools have even registered cases where disputes between immigrants and indigenous children escalate into violence.
The problem of integration of Eastern European children in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Fights, bullying and fights between the students have also taken place in the relationship between the parents.
The situation went so far as to arrest a Slovak woman in Chatham who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The defendant defends herself from being insulted by the boy with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene after two teenage girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly took racist remarks and threw stones at the man.
"As we were going home, a boy climbed to the bus stop and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he bent over to us with apples and pears, and then exposed his ass," the mother of Slovak pupils told The Times.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the local settlers even called the disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in the UK who came here to work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba's most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can come true for you if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, quiet as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean, you will find it in a full and even richer list.
There is only one island but you can find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and repository of treasures that the Spaniards in America looted and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional grew in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the US (especially under Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise houses were built in Havana, and cars that were iconic symbols of the 1950s roamed the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a mansion in San Francisco de Paula, just outside of Havana, and had his yacht in Coymar.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana.
The bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional serves cocktails according to your wishes.
And the iconic cars of the 1950s still run in Havana because the once imported fiddles and fiddles have long since rotted in that salty and damp air.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is considerably degraded, yet nowhere in the vicinity there are so many wonderful colonial monuments as right there.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings much-needed money, its development is green.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially on Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín, as well as on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another one that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by train drivers.
The cane from the vast plantations was transported to the sugar factories by steam and motor trains along narrow tracks.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many decades, so there are working machines, whose counterparts are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba will not miss.
And so about Varader, or about Havana, there is not much to write about.
Perhaps just to remind you that there is a museum in the already mentioned Hemingway estate, and anyone who likes this writer should not miss a visit.
Vinales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Vinales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone substrate.
Mogotes, limestone tubers, and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soil has clinged to their cavities, leaving even the aging rocks covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet its final appearance if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Perhaps it is interesting that Major Zeman’s Chilean part was filmed there.
Trinidad and Tobago
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and wealth were brought to him by the trade in slaves and sugar.
Wealth was transformed into the beauty and exhibitionism of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road connecting that region with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
There was nothing built there, so there was nothing crashing, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon to spend in Trinidad, then it is also worth taking a look at the interesting places in the vicinity, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
In the evening, you should go to Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music in it is quiet in the morning.
Baracoa
The small town in the very east of Cuba is described by some as the most beautiful on the island.
Surely such a view is influenced by the path itself.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and pass through nature that human activity has barely noticed.
The eastern island of Cuba has been inscribed by UNESCO on the list of world heritage sites thanks to its intact nature.
They make the best chocolate there, they have the Columbus Cross in the church (in fact, it was built about a hundred years after Columbus' voyage) and from the hill, where the former castle and today's El Castillo hotel stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness of the Caridad del Cobre, the santeria, the African religions professed by descendants of former slaves, there are many pages to describe.
But, as they say, it is better to see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, U.S. says
Few troops and a lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, the leaders of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing other plans and allied coordination.
While the United States, through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, has called on NATO forces to be more active this week, the UK sees it as a priority to strengthen the Afghan government’s authority and boost development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The second is to allow the people to start the further development of the economy and security themselves," Des Browne, the British defence secretary, told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan insurgent activity is the highest in five years, according to U.S. military data.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent from last year, in the southern province of Helmand even by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the next time and how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar vein today.
“I am not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
In recent months, there has also been controversy among the countries involved over whether allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the fighting demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun newspaper this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan vagrants exposed: Germans playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in the footage, supplemented by images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went into counter-attack and printed a picture of the British unit during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The national debt will rise to $1 trillion in 2009.
For every Czech, there is a national debt of over 84,000 crowns.
Total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to lend CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to the better development of the state budget.
The national debt of the Czech Republic rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In nine months of this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed its data on the national debt at the beginning of October.
For every Czech, there is a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state has indebted more than CZK 111 billion.
“For now, it seems that thanks to a lower deficit for next year, we could exceed the limit of a trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora said: “We could get to over one trillion in 2009.
Exactly when will depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I don’t expect that change,” he said.
Debts are rising
The national debt consists of the debts of the central government and arises primarily from the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The public debt is financed by treasury receipts, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the state has so far increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The foreign debt of the state so far this year has increased by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called negotiable state debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt increased to 6.5 years.
“Total debt rose 13 percent year-on-year for the first to third quarters, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that it will be doing business with when there is pension reform,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
The 2007 financing and debt management strategy shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to the better development of the state budget.
The amount consists mainly of the state budget deficit, which will probably reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the expected CZK 91.3 billion.
In addition, the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency are CZK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion-dollar reserve for the payment of pensions, financing of state bonds worth CZK 43 billion and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank in the amount of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear in court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear
A British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Khartoum tribunal on Thursday night and expelled, her lawyer said.
A British woman has been accused of allowing six to seven-year-old pupils to give the teddy bear the name Mohammed, despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is prohibited.
She was punished with whips.
The 54-year-old British teacher, who works at Unity High School in Sudan’s Khartoum, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
In fact, our story begins in September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
"Eight names will come out of the children's mouths, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohammed," said Robert Boulos, the school's director.
After voting in the classroom, 20 of the 23 children will eventually choose Muhammad as their favorite name.
Sure, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all it is a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a teddy bear accompanied by the caption: "My name is Mohammed".
The bear itself had no label with this name on it, but the difficulty is in depicting the prophet himself, which is considered an insult to Islam.
One fellow Muslim Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: "I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said it was just an "innocent misconduct."
This view is shared by many of the teachers' pupils, who describe her as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that they "never talk about religion in the classroom".
Recall that the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given first name in the United Kingdom, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, is it possible to give them toys?
Of course, it is a matter of interpretation.
In the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Eventually a failure.
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended their sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without overcoming divergent views on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides have not been able to reach an agreement on status," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is "at stake" and urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to peace and be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations have ended.
"We are not expecting violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period," he added, adding that "it is obvious that the situation is tense."
Negotiations end on December 10
The negotiators of the Troika, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last travel to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the population is Albanian-speaking, could be seen in a brighter light by December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko are due to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, mark the sixth and final round of negotiations since the United Nations commissioned the troika to renegotiate in August.
Americans and Europeans expect the talks to end on December 10.
On the other hand, the Russians, who had previously blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the UN Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains inclined towards a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Kharchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance by the international community, the West considers Kosovo's EU-supervised independence to be the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on expanded autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," Fatmir Sejdiu, the president of Kosovo's self-government, said in a hotel in Baden, where this "last chance meeting" has been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, the former rebel commander of Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations".
"The Domino Effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic, on the other hand, believes that a compromise is still possible and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of possible unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the “dominion effect” in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"But for Serbia, that does not mean," he said, "that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has veto power.
"Kosovo's parliament will have the final say"
"The only solution acceptable to Serbia is the solution that emerged from the Security Council," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"This meeting lasted two years.
It has to end the way it started: in the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the final say on the status" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population, it would take place "by agreement" with the West.
Bush makes a deal with Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened on his own initiative, US President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start talks to resolve the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything possible to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations for both sides stemming from the “road map” to peace that they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas, are aimed at “concluding a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the central issues”.
This statement includes three issues that are at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in the 1948 conflict in what is now the State of Israel.
Abbas took the floor after the US president, emphasizing that the follow-up talks should be “comprehensive and thorough” and touch upon all aspects of the solution, mentioning “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
Olmert then took the floor, expressing the view that the follow-up negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "a commitment should be made for them to be concluded during 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the deadline for the realization of his "vision of two states", Palestinian and Israeli, coexisting side by side.
Saudi Arabia said it had taken a commitment from Bush in this regard before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis stands for “a crossroads in Middle Eastern history, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” Prince Saud said in an interview he gave to an Arabic-speaking newspaper shielded by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from the Black Chronicle, the official versions do not agree with what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the Inspection générale de la police nationale (IGPN), a police car was passing through Louise-Michel in Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in the mode of intervention, but was on patrol and was traveling at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, without the side lights on," the police source explained.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore unauthorized to drive on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without a helmet, was driving "very high speed".
"A motorcycle crashed into a police car from the left side after not giving preference to the right," one police officer said.
A blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle's crew was negative.
The condition of the car (broken front, broken windshield, broken bumpers) indicates the sharpness of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, responded very quickly, announcing yesterday morning that she had commissioned the IGPN to investigate "acts of unintentional killing and non-assistance to persons at risk", which is also being handled by the police of the département départemental de la région.
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
The three witnesses to the crash, who were questioned on Sunday evening, confirmed “the police version, namely that the mini-engine approached them relatively quickly from the left.”
A notch, undoubtedly caused by the friction of the clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained locked until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, rumours quickly spread that police officers were to leave the scene quickly without providing first aid to two young men.
The IGPN was, with all caution, also to rule out "any serious wrongdoing" at this point.
“This is a more demanding aspect of the investigation that requires more investigation, and one that needs to be very careful with,” the police source said.
The newspaper "Libération" met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of the windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
“Immediately, my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, and I ran downstairs to try to resurrect them,” the witness said.
We couldn't do anything."
Then he saw "a lame, completely frightened policeman.
Two others were trying to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the rapidly growing tensions and the certainty that the situation of the young men was hopeless, the police officers were taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Don't let anyone say that the police did not come to the aid of the young people.
These young people were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
"Everything has been done to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tensions are Rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police cracked down on Monday on the first demonstration since Gen. Musharraf declared a state of emergency, two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades that law enforcement officials said had used.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several had to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of arrests of some 500 opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
Barriers blocked access streets to the Supreme Court on Monday morning to prevent assemblies.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers’ movement won the support of religious parties grouped in the politically strong Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president “encouraged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and garbage to those who took the oath before Musharraf.”
Musharraf's Promise Doesn't Hold
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, he was supposed to comment on the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf in the indirect presidential election, which took place on October 6.
Iftikhar Court President Mohammad Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the verdicts of the Supreme Court,” the official told The News.
Parviz Musharraf's promise to give up his military leadership and become a civilian president "is not valid" after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also refuted the country’s ongoing speculation that the deputy military chief was to order President Musharraf under house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unexpected
This estimate includes unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected pregnancies.
More than one in three (36%) pregnancies are still unexpected, according to a study conducted by France’s Institut national d’études démographies (Ined), the State Institute for Demographic Studies, 40 years after the passage of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which legalized contraception in France.
This estimate includes unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected pregnancies.
Different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, according to Ined.
The legalization of contraceptives has allowed better “fertility control,” the institute says, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptives in women between the ages of 20 and 44 has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of ten births are well planned.
One in five couples even have a birth calculated per month accurately and preferably in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of the year for the birth of a child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed more than seven hours of work in space to make a remarkable repair of a torn solar panel, necessary for further scientific work on the station.
It was a risky spacewalk that accumulated records in terms of duration, distance from the housing modules, the speed at which it was planned, and the degree of "cut-off" that the astronauts spent on repairs.
Trouble arose on Tuesday as the Discovery astronauts unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical body designed to install a European and Japanese science lab (see box).
This module is a kind of landing pier for modules-laboratories.
You need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was to relocate the 17-and-a-half-tonne module producing electricity using solar panels, which was already on the ISS, to anchor at its final position.
After relocating it, the crew began dismantling the module's seventy-six-meter solar panels.
And in that one of the panels, decomposing like a pulling accordion, as a result of the cable being pinched, was damaged on an area of almost one meter.
Decomposition has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally to make an inspection exit to the Discovery ship, and subsequently go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to pay attention to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, added to the arm of the station, and perform the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalkers of the U.S. Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, sturdy, very dexterous, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession of a doctor was commissioned to "operate" a "wounded" solar panel.
After thoroughly examining the damage, he cut off the defective cable and fixed a kind of "pavement" to the damaged areas.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker", who remained close to the balancing chamber, and also from the inside, by other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-jockey wrapped in an insulating agent to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was invented and crafted by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely disassembled and then inventoried his tools and returned to the station's interior.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were enjoying a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery spacecraft to return to Earth on Wednesday, as scheduled.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are falling sharply on the Paris stock exchange after the aerospace and defense company announced it would have to spend between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion to face the delay of an A400M aircraft.
EADS lost 4% and is now listed on the Paris Stock Exchange at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production results for 2007 due to the delays resulting from the slow development of the A400M engine, which is a prerequisite for the launch flight.
The price for mitigating delays in deliveries of the military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was "at 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus", the parent company of the European designer EADS said.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new earnings outlook before interest and taxes (EBIT) next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results.
The group also disclosed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that EADS production results fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, namely the giant A380 aircraft.
Initially, the group had assumed that the first delivery of the A400M to the French army would take place in October 2009.
Deciding on the status quo
Sunday’s elections will be held without any tense expectations: Russians will overwhelmingly elect President Putin’s side, United Russia.
Confirming thus, after the end of very little free election campaign, its tendency to stability, even to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin will give voters on public service stations a pre-recorded television message, the content of which is kept secret.
He is doing so from the position of the leader of United Russia, a pro-Kremlin party that seems to be celebrating a crushing victory.
When he received the foreign ambassador yesterday, the president did not let anything come out of him and was content with another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favorite topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, as transparent and open as possible elections, elections without the slightest defect in beauty,” he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that “never have such dirty elections been held, not even under Yeltsin.”
Following the crackdown on the demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, remains barred from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians were left with the homo sovietica mentality"
Against the backdrop of these parliamentary elections of simple tense expectations, two far more open questions are profiled:
"Who will be Putin's successor in the presidency?
Yesterday, the Official Gazette published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until December 23.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third term in a row.
However, no follower appears.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will elect a government and a president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win on the whole line in the parliamentary as well as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have a homo sovietica mentality, they don’t feel they are the masters of their destiny,” says Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg notes a time-distance context: civil society in this country converted to Christianity five centuries after Europe has accumulated a delay; that glorious common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin followed a paternalistic model of state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror, but by a certain economic well-being,” says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility” they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon applies to all social strata, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) control the local candidates of the United Russia.
The new freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
The public prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednichenko, a fifty-four-year-old professor: "Why think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why change them?”
Preoccupied memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fate of the 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are being opened to the public.
The 47 million archival documents stored over a length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) have so far been accessed only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and specifically, at the request of the former victim or his authorized persons.
Eleven states in charge of managing the archives – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is over, the opening yesterday came into effect.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to examine "particularly the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of the forced laborers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were against making these nominal documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation victims.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants drawn up by the Gestapo after the war were collected for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labour subjected to civilians, to bring them evidence of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only a limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at Berlin's Technische Universität, in 2006.
India and the EU to sign free trade agreements in 2008
Currently, bilateral trade between Europe and India reaches almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expected to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to start negotiations with the aim of signing free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is already reaching almost 60 billion euros.
The EU is India’s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is the EU’s ninth trading partner, according to the European Commission.
"The free trade agreement is vastly outweighing both economies" and "India will gain better market access for the 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by the Commission by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants together exchange "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi and Manha's EU, regretting that the joint trade between the two countries has not yet been successful.

The Bank of England took note of the concerns and offered <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in a five-week auction
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Thursday it intended to alleviate current fears that credit market conditions would deteriorate again and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion bid in a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75 percent, an offer that has been in place for an unusually long time.
“In an effort to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and to give banks greater confidence in how they will secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves during a maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation,” the Bank said in a statement.
The bank said that <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) would be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT until January 10, at the basic interest rate.
This appears to be the first time BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
It usually takes a week.
The BOE added in its communiqué that it "remains ready to take further measures to keep interest rates" of interbank loans at the same level as its base rate.
The interbank interest rate was 5.829 percent on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to fee rates that have discouraged banks from using this offer.
According to some speculation reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro exchange rate, many preferred the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire) and NC (Nouveau Centre) refuse to consider Socialists’ (PS) proposals on purchasing power
The clubs UMP and Nouveau Centre on Thursday refused to discuss individual paragraphs of the socialist draft law on purchasing power, which equates to a rejection of the text.
The text of the bill was put on the agenda as part of the so-called socialist "nest" (meeting initiated by individual parliamentary groups) and contained ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS Presidency, including an increase in the employment premium by 50%, the renewal of fluctuating TIPPs, a traffic check or rent regulation.
As the UMP and NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the session was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The head of MPs, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his club would again submit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the amendment to the law on finance, which will be discussed in the House next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is launching a new festival, this promoter/producer of Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in cooperation with the Festival Republic of British organizer Melvin Benn.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration,” Billboard.com’s Charlie Jones said in a statement.
C3 is produced by Chicago's Lollapalooza Festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to August 10 on a private 500-acre farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s most acclaimed festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, has also been in charge of production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 describes Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he has ever experienced, saying his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival event.
“We originally chose Philadelphia as our market and worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to set up a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
"I worked with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, because of the current leadership of the city, we are stuck in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we’ve had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we’re about to set up a great festival in an exceptional location that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park, Chicago in 2005, after excelling at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
Gross revenue for both events for 2007 was $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both festivals are held in an urban setting.
“The European model of Melvin Benn takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in the green spaces of cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a way that creates the impression of both a rural festival in the European and an urban festival in the American way.”
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, is excited to support this event,” said Charlie Jones.
The latter declined to disclose the terms of the deal, but said they were "beneficial enough to allow us to invest in such an event and welcome a festival that will hopefully last a long time".
Charlie Jones says the capacity of the festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which can accommodate 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent out to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed when the program is just being printed.
“Vineland will have a rocky feel, but the music will be varied to attract a wide audience as much as possible,” says Carlie Jones.
Partners of C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last edition of the Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when Terminator himself opposes it.
This persuasive mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
But his mandate is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall into the claws of the "Governor"?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where to go.
If he finds that conditions in Montreal are favorable, he will go there.
Our task is to offer the ones that they consider to be the best," he said.
Hunting for festivals
For now, however, Denise Turcotte's priority is to promote local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, be they in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that directors give interviews.
The Age of Darkness had good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be unveiled in November at the 30th edition of the Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also presented four shorts and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year on the stock exchange? Experts divided 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and investors already have their hands on me in the expectation that the traditional marathon will take place at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December is a positive month on the stock exchange".
However, it is not appropriate to make predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially since, in the current context, there are, at least in the short term, certain doubts."
These experts do not assume that the stock market will move in the last weeks of the year, stating that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income affected by the effect of turnover on quality securities, both in long and short periods."
Therefore, they believe that the exchange will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, "primarily because the impact of the likely fall in Fed (Federal Reserve System) rates is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the danger of stimulus to inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time to make bold statements that a marathon will take place.
"There is not much reason to rejoice," the expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to portfolio regrouping and traditional pension deposits occurring annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different, as he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after the extended Constitution Day weekend.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the direction of the market.
At the same time, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "therefore we could observe the reflection of the index, triggered by reports from the US about the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on a selection of titles that will take Ibex to the new highs.
Intermoney's Solana confirms that "this year is a row on strong titles".
The expert would include both major banks and some construction firms in the portfolio, “because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive.”
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
Construction companies will also be able to get rich at this marathon if it happens.
“ACS has been re-establishing its position for several months now, and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and the FCC, will follow the same path,” the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also do very well, even if it is not very represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of declines in two cases.
The real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Likewise for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to make such a leap and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 and open on Saturday from 10 am to 20.30 pm.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly assured that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to enter into an agreement with the unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, albeit not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be decisive for whether or not other actors will join this initiative, which supports the opening hours of trades.
This is exactly the goal of the project, which was set by Popular Bank.
Acquire individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, entrepreneurs and shops from selected streets, where branches will open.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, as this is not the opening of new branches, but only the adjustment of existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernise the branches it already has in the business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
This is complemented by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colours.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, the bank’s chief commercial officer, assures that this restructuring will not involve a major investment, but more recruitment as it moves from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
Branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera explains.
Branches were chosen in Madrid's streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a happy choice.
Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 immigrant specialties, which operate under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and public holidays.
PopularMax subsidiaries will not follow the BBVA model when a number of its subsidiaries offer a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our clients," Rivera said.
They have just agreed with Telefónica to sell mobile phones through external staff.
Telecinco for the first time on the stock exchange doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3
We did it.
With this sentence, yesterday, Paolo Vasile, executive chairman of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the end of the trade, when he noted that the TV he controls has doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'What I'm sorry is that it didn't happen because we grew more, but because we fell less,' he said.
And he stressed that because of the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco closed trading yesterday with a shift of 2.54%.
This profit pushed their loss for the previous part of the year to 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocento (another 13%) is 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.52% yesterday and fell by 40.5% overall since January, has a half value of 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that have been evaluated is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2.518.53 million Prisa (publisher Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is offered, because "we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price, and how we evaluate it in the audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it expects this year to be the first TV channel to surpass a billion gross advertising revenues, Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising arm, assured.
If the predicted figure had actually been achieved, the TV channel would have seen an increase in advertising turnover of 3.6% this year, compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, net turnover of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% (amounting to 734.4 million), while net revenue of this TV increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on for Telecinco’s best relative development on the stock exchange is the increased payout it has retained so far: in 2006, the firm, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits to its shareholders.
Vasile assures that even though it is too early to make a decision, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, with whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently cut its Telecinco profit estimates by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected revenue growth has stopped from 0,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and from 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
The same company reduced the estimated profit of Antenna 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves MiFID transposition effective November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that ended today with a vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has subjected a public hearing to a regulation that is developing the new law, with the aim that both will enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the parties agreed on the efforts of MEPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of the entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernization of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow the provision of financial advisory services to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons, and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs) that join securities companies, securities brokerage firms and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of transactions with financial instruments is expanding by joining regulated secondary markets with multilateral trading and order internalisation systems that will compete with current exchange brokers.
The law further obliges firms providing investment services to disseminate on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and ways of dealing with risk, and requires a record of all operations performed to simplify supervision by the CNMV.
Several adjustments were included in the Congressional Trade Commission's deliberations, among which one stands out to make securitised receivables considered a "complex" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor that has been demonstrated by what has happened in the US with high-risk mortgage debts (subprime).
Moreover, the transposition of the directive was used to legally define the functions that can be held by bachelors in the field of economics and business management 30 years after the Royal Decree, which sets out professional functions reserved for economists, was approved in 1977.
At the same time, the Senate included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from the CNMV and will be able to provide services of trading in products and acquiring clients for different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, later used by Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides preliminary information on the evolution of prices in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This interim indicator is calculated using the same process used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistical Institute) recalled that the information provided by this provisional indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final figure, which will come to light on 14 December this year.
"The ISC will continue to maintain at a relatively high level"
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said the November increase in the ISC to 4.1% is a "temporary number", but also predicted that the price index will remain at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified on the sidelines of Congress that “although it will not be a favorable figure,” Spain’s inflation differential to monetary union has been “more or less” the same over the past two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the economy minister said in a statement.
Virgin plans to make <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock over three years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion).
At the time, the bank was managing record deposits worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>25bn, which gradually declined over a period of two and a half months, despite the fact that the government offered a 100% guarantee for this money and will extend it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the name of the entity with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to raise about a quarter of the revenue deposited in British banks in the next three years, to raise the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion, reaching the goal of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known in the UK for its striking advertising campaigns, plans to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50m (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70m) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock Bank branded the Virgin consortium, which comprises three other companies, as the one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
In the early hours of this morning, the Civil Guard detained the current mayor of the Murcian town of Totana (from the People’s Party) for his alleged involvement in corrupt construction practices, which were uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the city hall secretary and the head of the local police were arrested.
In May of this year, José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current People’s Deputy and then mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources approached by Cadena SER television, could have been the “head” of the entire company.
Police continue to monitor the building of the City Hall and the construction commission and further arrests in the coming hours are not ruled out.
In addition, lawyer Juan Morales, the main suspect in the corruption practices in the construction, which were uncovered earlier this week, was charged.
Cadena SER, a lawyer for "people's" MP Juan Morales who was being investigated, was arrested leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to investigative sources, Morales is also being investigated for collecting commissions for signing a construction agreement with a Galician construction company that requalified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepts offer to lead Toledo’s PSOE candidate and, if they win, preside over Congress
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Secretary General of the Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to head the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) candidate list in Toledo in the next general election, and if the Socialists win the general election, Congress will win.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE’s secretary for the organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapatero at the party’s federal headquarters this afternoon.
The head of the executive department justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the presidency of Congress, if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as chairman of Congress, who on November 15 announced his decision not to run in the next general election and to leave his active political career in order to dedicate himself to the fight against climate change within university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister constantly urged him to return to the top politics he left two years ago.
He said that just as citizens know who will be the deputy minister of economy, if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a “transparent form” who will preside over Congress.
If Bono wins the post, he hopes to turn the House into a "house of respect, not insults or shouting" and "make it look more and more like citizens".
“Unfortunately, sometimes it seems that the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to speak in peace and quiet is Congress, the Prime Minister in the Senate was interrupted 26 times on one occasion.”
He also praised the current President Manuel Marín and "his good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place yet, so as not to reduce himself to what he said his opponents might consider "greatness".
Climate Propaganda
As the anti-climate movement subjects to relentless persecution both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles, it must demonstrate firm cohesion.
Moreover, to have a leader of the movement who is a prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a “new treaty with the planet”.
This proposal compels him to explain why the action or inaction of his government has significantly contributed to Spain leading the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance, in which sectors it happens and why his government, the government of the treaty, did not prevent it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain to the Spaniards as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take to slow down climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what will be the economic consequences.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays to save the planet.
But we have not seen such explanations, nor will we see them.
This is because we have to sacrifice and pay.
Climate action, real action, is unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one cent of the gasoline price, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party), seemed so risky to Zapatero in terms of elections that he hastened to reject it.
In other words, it’s about saving the planet without cost, with pure propaganda, slogans lacking any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, committees, committees, protocols and new posts.
And by treaties with the planet; this lord so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, accuse, demand anything, but adorns meetings and arouses tenderness.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contractor and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool off with a fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police Totana detained on suspicion of corrupt practices in the construction
According to investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the “people” José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the city hall and one hospitality businessman, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and transported to the town hall, where he now resides, along with a number of police officers who also appeared before the Construction Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Lands and Apartments.
The three arrests add to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation involving the re-qualification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land for land suitable for development, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last 4 election period, could build there.
In addition, two other people were not arrested, but are charged in summary proceedings in the first instance court of the city of Totana.
The first six arrestees were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana and today a member of the autonomous parliament for the People’s Party (PP), Juan Morales, is under investigation.
His ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region, were also charged.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria Group, a lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and through which bribes were handed over.
The investigation is being carried out by a crime group in the construction of the operational central unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrests, also carried out eleven searches, mostly in companies related to the detainees, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid province) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, in the area of a very well-known owner of a poultry products company who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the Murcian town of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was requalified and its project was to double the population of the village, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to the promotion of the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and in the square Fernando el Católico in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing, and Preconiza, which focuses on construction and sales.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this commentary from yesterday’s issue of the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper printed on November 18, the same day that a criticism of Blackburn’s book happened to appear there:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated into the public debate in connection with the tragedy at the school in the city of Jokela.
The murderer of the victims, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the education councilor responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical stance on Plato and argued that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory elementary course of philosophy in secondary schools.

One colleague informs about the introduction of the crime of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime with a rate of between six months and one year.
On the other hand, if you steal records for less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 in a store, it is considered a mere violation (<0xC2><0xA7> 623.1).
B. If you steal up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 in a store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for withdrawal (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal the car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (<0xC2><0xA7> 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than a compact exchange.
To participate in the riot has a rate from three months to one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be the rate from six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered to be less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading a film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is more punishable than the provision of pornographic material to minors (Section 186).
So if my colleague's right, someone's got a hand, and they're right.

My doctor pushes me one of his articles about strange research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feelings that a monthly salary evokes for employees depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomograph, and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and leader of the Neurocognitive Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The greatest activation occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague incorrectly."
Researchers observed that if both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one got doubled, the activation was higher.
I really don’t know if this conclusion required so much science.
Applicant of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting Balkan war criminals from the State Prosecutor’s Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre that killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list, from which the name is taken from the documentary film by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin list" (2006, not listed in Spain), which follows the pace of the detective thriller from Belgrade to New York the work of the Swiss prosecutor in the persecution of fugitive criminals.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a significant expense, which depends on various factors such as age, status, gender, length of possession of a driving licence, the type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured person.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the insurance company will receive the agreed insurance amount in a certain amount for taking charge of the payment of damages in the event of an insured event.
Insurance premium is the price of insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, status, gender, length of possession of a driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the more likely an accident is, the higher the premium rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, insurance companies concluded that married people have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of travel and thus the likelihood of having an accident.
As the number of trips increases, the likelihood increases.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the price of insurance premiums.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the insurance that best fits his profile of the insured.
We will show here the most important variables for choosing this or that type of insurance, which, in addition to satisfying the type of insured, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five face various disadvantages such as little driving experience and a short driving license when they want to arrange insurance premiums at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discounted premium so as to get insurance coverage for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would involve the client’s participation in the payment of the insured event.
"The part of the premium payment provided by the client will be predetermined in determining the premium price, which will be the higher, the lower the contribution," explains Luis Noguera, Chief Executive Officer of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other traffic participants so that the client insures against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce your insurance premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
In contrast, malus is an increase in the aforementioned base rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus,” Noguera explains.
After crossing the twenty-five-year limit, it is easier for drivers when they go to arrange insurance, as their client's risk index decreases, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange insurance against all risks at a discount.
"Young people are usually unable to take advantage of the experience they have gained in advance when an accident occurs, or even when driving," the director of a European company in Spain assures, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of the procedure, when the "newcomer's fear" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but has no children, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows it.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be the clients with the lowest risk index and therefore their surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a premium discount (which could be 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other road users, starting from the third year from the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their driving is calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount," says Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are recommended insurance against all risks with a premium discount (up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 150) or insurance extended to other participants in the operation, if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is a good reason to properly study the insurance options that would suit us best in our personal situation.
Celtic are trying to get a point to AC Milan, which means the eighth final
AC Milan and Celtic will compete this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to score the point they lack to reach their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, as for the Italians it would mean being first and for the Scots it would decide on the placement.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured a promotion in the fifth match by a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but needs one more to be sure that Shakhtar with six points will not get ahead of him, who will play with Benfica, who has four.
The two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will play their first 13th in the semi-finals, in an effort to advance to the final, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others, and a tie at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems most likely, even if both teams try to fight for victory, because the Italians will not want to tackle at home and Celtic knows that after winning he would be first and secure a better place in the eighth final.
Gordon Strachan could even lose if Shakhtar doesn’t win, but he can’t count on it because the Ukrainians, who lost in Glasgow last week (2: 1) but won in the first straight match (2: 0), will advance with the same number of nine points.
So AC Milan players will try to spoil the evening for the Scots, who believe that they will reach the semi-finals in the reorganized Champions League for the second time, just as they defeated them in the same match in the previous competition with a goal Kaká in prolongation (1: 0) after a 0: 0 in the regular season.
The hope that the Rossoneri will win will be Shakhtar, for whom he is worthy of victory, only if Celtic loses, both for the promotion to the eighth final and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and does not have the opportunity to continue in the highest European competition, could reach third place with one victory, so it would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver was attended by 20,000 people.
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 people since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they began their gig at GM Place in Vancouver.
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which also included a video telling the band's history, which sparked a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and the world tour take place at the same time as they release the new album, which is released in Spain by EMI, which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five of the Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets donated to them by the husband of "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the crowd that flooded GM Place, even though nervous Victoria forbade him to do so a few days ago.
Before the show, Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he hasn't seen our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he'll think of the show."
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to differences between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also showed its nervousness at a meeting with journalists two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I’m glad I made the decision,” Chisholm said of the reunification of the group, which she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time "things have settled down and we all love each other very much".
However, a lot has changed since the last time the Spice Girls performed together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines special.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
The five have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
He will perform in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns over new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine over the price of natural gas, which increases the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices to Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine.”
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a drastic drop in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one-fourth of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underexploited.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS 'must check foreign employees'
The inspector said the Scottish chambers of the NHS must improve criminal records checks on non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black also fears that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate idea of the amount of foreign personnel it employs.
But his report stressed that the other key checks went well on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in personnel from countries outside the European Economic Area immediately after the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after a Jeep crashed into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of being linked to attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS Chambers are expected to inspect foreign personnel for qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK prior to their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland for criminal records checks, the agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that commissions should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we found that some of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out on a regular basis," the report said.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS is largely in line with its own pre-employment checks policy, but added: “Our report draws attention to areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information about the amount of foreign personnel available.”
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment controls in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear what further value those comments will bring," he said.
Scottish health authorities said they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures will probably be higher also because the commissions had a problem identifying staff with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the established inspection procedures at the NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are being largely implemented.
They included passport, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently revising the policies and directives of pre-employment controls for NHS foreign workers.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I wanted to get this job done immediately after the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.”
She also added that the Scottish government, in consultation with the health commissions, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that best practices appear in the updated pre-employee inspection directives for all staff – including foreign ones – that it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division wins film awards
Control, a biographical film about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, collected five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.
The awards also went to star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and in the supporting role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller Notes on the Scandal.
And bondage star Daniel Craig won a Variety Award for bringing British film to the world stage.
The awards were handed out at the London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film – whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – cost just <0xC2><0xA3>3m.
But he won Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree, two awards - for Best Director and Best Debut Director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning - as Julien Temple's film about singer Clash Joe Strummer won the Best Documentary Award.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of the Russian mob boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg’s Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on the roles of tough guys, won the Richard Harris Award for his extraordinary contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another Indiana Jones film, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of the award, which is named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
“People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened doors for people like me,” he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
The Independent Film Awards, known as Biffy, are awarded by a jury of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syalo and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrested 208 People Over Terrorist Conspiracy
Saudi Arabia has arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as spiritual and security forces.
State television reported that one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have been campaigning against the monarchy, allies of the United States, since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that an alien-led cell of eight militants was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to defend facilities from the world’s largest oil refinery in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the ministry’s internal statement as saying that 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a “missile launcher expert” who slipped into the country.
She also said the militants planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
Twenty-two of the detainees were to prepare the murders of clergy and security personnel.
The government has urged clerics to do more to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaida militants fighting allied troops and a US-backed Shia government that conservative Sunni Saudis see as heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that the authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants — backed by calls by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government — focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and power facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by security forces over the past...five months," a ministry spokesman told state television.
A 16-member “media cell” in Medina was also arrested to promote “Takfirian thinking” – an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
Venus' climate may be a glimpse into Earth's future
Scientists say Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from the orbiting European station show that the planet is even more similar to the stubborn twin Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and orbit in similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago Venus had conditions similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the flushed greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and a slower rotation rate sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and is ravaged by storms and winds of hurricane strength.
The findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which studied the planet for one year, offer a sober look at how Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the physics department at the University of Oxford and one of the mission leader Venus Express, said: "It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
“Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began, just like Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago.”
Police seize 'enriched uranium'
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people had been detained and the material was being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Constantly wide
Mitt Romney said it was not worthy for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters uploaded their questions to a video and forwarded them for broadcast to the candidates.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday was as comical as a snowman asking Democrats about global warming in a second-party debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected much about the Republican Party’s state of affairs toward next year’s election.
It is unclear exactly how the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips, which were then shown to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This topic is one of the strongest Republican topics.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the wheel when they heard something reassuring: the broadcaster noted peaks of approval when the candidates spoke of a hard-line approach at the border.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main nationwide candidate, and Mr Romney, who swept ahead in key early voting in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
The two fought particularly hard when questioners asked whether any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (giving illegal immigrants a normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Co-candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to throw their little bit into the mill on the subject.
Neither of the two have a chance to be nominated, but both remain in the game perhaps because they started sounding the alarm for immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, candidates have roughly the same view: greater severity at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This topic, along with concerns about poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate started to get very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One interviewer asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani came to the conclusion that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – who is now at the forefront of all assumptions in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty is annoying but necessary.
Under pressure to decide if Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning him laughter.
The fight remains extremely open.
Mr Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with recent money-raising successes and Ron Paul’s loud cheer at Wednesday’s debate.
The two have bounced off the bottom as both wings of the party still can’t agree on the more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with a winning report of American size on his lips, blinking on both wings of the party.
This time, the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Labour's Pain
Gordon Brown once again found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is a habit in British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
No orders seem to have been sold, no bills at the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been sucked.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would have done without it being discovered that some wealthy businessman had for four years masked the ruling Labour Party’s <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 contributions ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election and insulted the British intelligentsia by claiming that this decision was not influenced by polls, there was hope that he would secure a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly humorous Liberal Democrat deputy chairman put it, the once feared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The awkward rescue of troubled Northern Rock Bank showed weaknesses in management and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data on 25 million people has revealed unimaginable administrative failure.
A trio of retired generals began a revolt in the House of Lords; they protested against the cuts in military spending, arguing that being a commander of the armed forces was a part-time job.
Now there are multifaceted gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s secretary general (and their former guardian of internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading towards his end.
Nevertheless, governments may reach a tipping point, beyond which they find it difficult to govern.
People don't trust politicians and don't like them, but they usually push their distrust away when a new group takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, and may not even be in office for long, this is a push away: the state administration becomes leaky, ministers begin to make briefings, the press searches for bad news, and the government becomes unfocused and defensive.
In one way, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because he cannot take the position of a new broom compared to other political leaders.
As much as he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the tax office are related to the decisions Mr Brown made as Secretary of the Treasury.
And even though he was not directly involved in Blair’s troubles, such as the long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by “dignities for money,” voters can safely conclude that he was.
Yet Mr. Brown's troubles are not as bad as they seem.
They’re not as bad as conservatives do.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been outright deceived.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm, and slightly brutal government.
The recent turmoil over political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he did not wish for any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision wasn't up to him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abrahams's progress but did not know that he was illegal, would certainly be thoroughly questioned; so would Jon Mendlesohn, the chief Labour money-seeker, who had learned of the fraudulent gifts in October.
But so far Mr. Brown has not been involved in any way; there is nothing to suggest that he was aware of these plots, even though the bulk of the payments took place after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the law by his own party, but diluted his determination by reaching for a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter -- led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, this is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had no one for six months, and moving forward with a real reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require Labour, who are in a tight spot, to cooperate with the Conservatives, and perhaps even to give up their special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a devoted party man like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to get his voters back; and the only way to win is through undisputed integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Is the Mortgage Crisis Affecting the US Credit Card Market?
When there is blood in the water, the dorsal fins naturally begin to stir excitedly around.
With the U.S. real estate market now declining, predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say credit card losses could reach $99 billion if other variants of consumer credit were infected by subprime mortgages.
The signs of tension are obvious.
There is an increasing number of cases of inability to pay (with more than 30 days of late payment) and write-offs (accounts that the provider considers unenforceable).
Last month, HSBC announced that it had lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer credit market, also due to insolvent credit card loans.
It is too early to panic, however.
The bills written off and the inability to pay are still few.
According to Moody's, the 3.89% insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost a whole percentage point below the average.
The deteriorating rates can partly be explained by technical reasons.
A change in the U.S. Personal Bankruptcy Acts in 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies, which account for a large part of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of depreciations) would therefore rise regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorated.
The industry also has a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts monthly.
And trust in secured credit card securities is solid, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct pathways to spread infection between the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: when property loans run dry, consumers are more likely to get into debt through credit cards.
However, credit card issuers look at cash flow rather than the value of guaranteed items, so falling house prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They can even be advantageous for loan providers.
Consumers’ motivation to repay mortgages decreases when their assets fall below the value of the loan; as a result, card debt moves up on the repayment priority list.
Card issuers are also able to respond more quickly and flexibly to more turbulent conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of a rapid change in the prices of guarantee items.
“It’s not like we’re going to rethink all of our loans one fine morning,” said Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of low-end mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is much more real.
If lower house prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were due to be prosecuted for their roles in a fraud involving former Enron financial leader Andrew Fastow, changed their testimony on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew were initially guilty of seven fraud charges, in which they and Fastow were to participate in a financial fraud in 2000 -- to enrich themselves at the expense of their employers -- they denied.
They were due to stand trial in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone admitted to one fraud.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was on the front page for two years, which took the issuing procedure.
In the United States, their case is one of the unfinished parts of an investigation launched after the Enron crash in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he had been the target of a government investigation into Enron's collapse.
The indictment against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Troika" -- alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to frame a scam together with Fastow and his former chief aide Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest has invested in Enron’s partner office controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of many of Enron’s scams that pushed Enron into a spiral toward bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank rated its stake in this branch at zero, but our three Britons knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
The company under Kopper's control bought the bank's stake in this branch for $1 million.
The incriminating bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow misinformed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in Greenwich NatWest.
But the $20 million went to those British bankers, Fastow, and others.
The bankers were charged with $7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others were charged with $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were free on a $1 million bail ordering them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks made it impossible to hide billions in debt or report failed speculation as profitable.
The collapse cut thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pensions.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company’s downfall.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were erased after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's Non-Powerlessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $ 54 million.
For some of Russia’s wealthy, however, this is a small return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Führer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in so many jobs because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Führer sat at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Show, a four-day orgy of pompous consumerism at a mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors built their booths, hoping to lure the newly rich Russians to everything from mahogany-landed yachts to diamond-decorated car counters they wouldn’t be ashamed of even 50 Cent.
Mr. Führer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the next stand.
"It's a nice car, but it's pennies and pennies against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market."
On the waves of oil, money flows into the Russian capital just as it did when Dallas had its days.
“We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans got enormously rich and drove to Europe, where they were viewed as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year student at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi scammers of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world’s most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part in this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a luxury industry conference attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like Russia’s.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes magazine’s list of the richest people, Russia has 53 billionaires with a total wealth of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the Center for Economic and Financial Research’s local main institute has released a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 “second-class” millionaires in Russia, whose assets total $ 670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for the London jewellery store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are impeccably dressed, and men are each worth a fortune."
As they walked through the halls in their evening dress on Sunday evening, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and five years older Svetlana Turovtsova described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've looked at the cars, and I can't decide between an Infiniti, a Mercedes, or a Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who wrapped herself in her branded clothes like a red carpet veteran, and made Joan Rivers look like a housewife.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at fresh wealthy, brand-driven Russian buyers who are willing to sit for a few hours on the road in order to walk around the warehouse, which is shrillly mixing Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, ice cream Mövenpick, billiard tables in Dubai.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's painting of hand-painted blue tiles in supersized size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in gilding."
Indeed, local salespeople say that the Russians with the old money (by Russian standards it is 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from flashy logos to little-known limited-edition brands that would never show up at the shopping fair.
Even so, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaires’ ambassadors or ordinary tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
Some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil’s beds, said he sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold threads, at $70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company had sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car maker, said he had sold three interconnected chain-shaped car bars for the Rolls-Royce Phantom for $55,000.
He showed a reporter a wheel of a car designed for a Russian casino owner that had a string coated with Swarovski crystals that looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of those.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a cubic zirconia portrait of his wife doesn't have to ride those wheels yet," Karapetian said.
'He'll put them in his garage for thirty to forty cars.'
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase “Russian millionaire” does not mean anything too exclusive at the moment, given the large increase in the prices of local real estate.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by the Russian asset management firm Alliance Continental.
The company erected four red British-style telephone booths lined with columns of counterfeit $1 million bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires’ Fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around a heap of money, or to have their friends take pictures with their cell phones, resting in the middle of a surrogate fortune, or simply to fill their pockets with a few million.
"You know, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey Possibly Caused by Failed Surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked from the large windows of the restaurant a little healthier and watched the ambulance arrive at the white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
Soon a police patrol car joined in.
And then another.
"Then I saw the coroner's van arrive," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant inspector.
"I knew at that moment that someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, an executive assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon, whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and hope that toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of grief to the Newark Police Department.
Ms. Arroyo has been assistant police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tough, and hard-working," Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
It would protect me.”
Mr McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons, aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for Union County Attorney Theodora J. Romankowa, said detectives are trying to find out if Miss Arroyo died from unlicensed surgery.
'It's one option, 'Miss Walsh said.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
They found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't say if the authorities had questioned Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if a part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday at Ms. Castro's house, with a broken rose bush in the front garden and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door that led to the cellar, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics - was sitting in an open garage.
Two mountain bikes hung on one side of the hooks.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York City in 25 years, Ms. Arroyo had provided him with invaluable help in tackling the intolerable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should watch out for this one or that one,'" he said.
"She was always there when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will lower interest rates, leads to a strengthening of the world stock exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic skyrocketed yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Bank will try to pacify borrowing conditions by further lowering interest rates were reinforced by reassuring statements by the US vice-president of the central bank.
Stock exchanges jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line to Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said that in response to continued pressure on financial markets, managers must be “flexible and pragmatic.”
As part of an apparent effort to soothe irritated markets amid signs of a reviving credit effort, Mr Kohn said recent upheavals "have partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of markets in late September and October".
He also said that if the increased instability persists, there will be an increased chance that the financial conditions of households and businesses will deteriorate further.
Investors see these remarks as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver more fresh capital supplies to U.S. markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped to reassure Wall Street amid other bad news about the U.S. economy when home sales in October showed record lows.
The financial turmoil was underscored by investment bank Bear Stearns’ announcement that it will cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of cost cuts to offset heavy losses caused by a failed bid to provide low-end housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these locations are expected to be closed in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index rose 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
The London-based FTSE 100 rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, while the value of British blue chips rose by more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion.
The German Dax rose 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets showed their full strength after the auction of the European Central Bank’s three-month money packages lent these funds to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB to issue premium money to London’s money markets has increased, with Libor’s three-month interbank lending rates soaring to their highest level since late September after a sustained rise from November 12th.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, chairman of the board of directors, who holds this post at best in the borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision to help, and because the desk of Hugh Morris, the manager of the English team, is not necessarily the head of the board of directors, is starting to fill with applications for the national post.
Those who are not ranked sixth on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It is not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else will never get through a lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket, the choice is demanding and requires an opinion, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah, if it is?
We could ask the same thing in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with a good education and a good track record in the industry, should be promoted to the commission - there's only room for one.
Who can say which level is right for a cricketer when he has no chance of falling or swimming to the next?
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he is to take the wicket, and the batter needs regular chances in the starting positions if he is ever to impress as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the view of the collector is more complicated.
For example, last season was much better, which James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched as an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs each.
Chris Tremlett took the same modest average of only 29, but both had their moments at the highest level and hope for another.
Whether he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium or Bopar can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice may spur or overtake the careers of both, or it may not have much impact either.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and in the first class he gave good performances, five wickets and 40 free runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time was fighting for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketer, who, in addition, despite being in Australia against Australia, may still have scored under a hundred.
Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores are more likely to follow their conservative instincts after another discussion following today’s training session at Asirgiya Stadium and prefer Shah’s greater experience to Bopar’s youthful lushness.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut test shifts at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 in first class compared to six Bopars, who, at twenty-two, is seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin throws.
However, Shah made only ten runs in two shifts in May against the Caribbean at Test on Lord's, his home field in Middlesex, and this, together with the immediate refusal of the collectors when Vaughan wanted to cast him again for the next match, his launching seems to have taken away something of the vigour that was in Bom.
The Essex universal, on the other hand, has a joye de vivre in its bones.
Nothing scares him on the cricket court, and his off-court behavior is symbolized by a recently overturned four-wheel drive car at the exhibition day of the English team’s automotive sponsor, Volkswagen.
He escaped with minor injuries and probably shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching from a distance, to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-speed sliding throws on the local pitches seem to suit him, he distributes efficiently and shoots confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that’s the real art of choice.
Personally, I am inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which is not to say that Shah will not excel if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, it is he who will play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaida
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, dumping refugees who ran out of money or visas, and others hoping the city was returning to normal life.
Some have even returned to fight the militants who have driven them out of their homes.
Before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy for a dozen buses, Mansour Bus Station was already full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspapers, because of what was going on in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shia militia of militant cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni Amariyah region, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyya called him saying that the local militia with the support of the US military helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who was driven out of his home in Sleikhu, northern Baghdad, by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Some friends called me the day before yesterday and told me that they were launching a militia against al-Qaeda in Sleikhu and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That’s why I’m back today,” said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many have talked about the attraction of calm in the capital after the strengthening of the US military presence and the growth of local "groups of biased citizens" who, with guns in hand, side by side with the US military, defend their neighborhood.
But more was said to have been driven back by visa obstructions and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, loudly expressed a suspicion shared among the refugees that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas, prompting them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas so they would have to go back to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left.”
Part of the reason for the weakening of the violence is the fact that the Sunnis were pushed out of Shia areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tensions.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will once again inflame sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Small Saarland, good education
Germany’s smallest state plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even in the international focus of its universities.
In only one area of education, Saarland is concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"To a man who is not from Saarland, I explained yesterday for the fiftyth time that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a big role in the Saar education system, which is in fifth place in the education monitoring of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighboring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a reasonably high share of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Saar children are admitted to university - many of them even without going to grammar school.
“The professional education system is being used in Saarland,” says Axel Plünnecke, an IW education expert.
With more than one in five young people qualifying for vocational training, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, Saarland offers a wealth of opportunities to combine practical and academic education.
Opportunities to study two majors are second best in Germany given the population.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saarland Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering fields.
"After the first study of Pisa, we implemented several reforms in general education schools," said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that other federal states are taking over as well.
If the results of the pupils improve significantly, future comparative studies will show.
When the Pisa study was conducted in 2003, the proportion of high-risk pupils was reduced from 29 % to 20 %.
Overall, however, Saarland did not improve as much as other federal states.
Bavarians are better at counting.
And disappointingly, the Saar studies of Pisa do not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise Saarland could score in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in grammar schools - even if the inhabitants of Saarland are not French.
Chavez shifts the clock
The hours will soon be different in Venezuela than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez will have the clock in this South American country pushed back half an hour.
In Spain, in the meantime, Chávez becomes a ridiculous figure.
Venezuela’s official newspaper reported that under the new law, the clock will shift from world time by minus four and a half hours.
The South American state will take this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chavez, an enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by imposing time zones on the world for hours.
On Wednesday, Chávez said he was cutting ties with neighboring Colombia over the hostage situation.
This left-wing nationalist has said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not have any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do it anymore because of my self-respect," said Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the people of the oil-rich country must vote on in a Sunday referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The dispute was sparked by Uribe's decision to revoke Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with the Marxist rebels for the release of the hostages.
Uribe's decision "spit in the face" of Venezuela, he criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chavez.
The new mobile ringtone sparked an uproar here: “Por qué no te callas” (Why aren’t you quiet anymore?) – a phrase that has already been downloaded from the Internet by more than half a million people.
It was voiced by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who at the recent Ibero-American summit was so angered by the loud remarks of this left-wing populist that he silenced him in this way.
Germans face lower wages in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are at risk of a reduction in real wages this year, despite the strong economic situation.
Experts have justified their pessimistic forecast for a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007 employed people can realistically expect to receive a lower salary than last year.
"It's a small increase in wages, an increase in value-added tax and an increase in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung (IMK) told Bild.
New burdens on employees may also await in the field of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% by the new year is right and reasonable in this situation.
The Federal Labour Agency, however, would no longer be allowed to fall into such difficulties as to require loans or contributions from the Federal Youth, the newspaper quoted this social-democratic politician as saying.
On Tuesday, it was reported that the price explosion of food and oil products pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In the annual comparison, prices increased by three percent.
Venus is the hellish twin of Earth
Despite its life-hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought. The European spacecraft Venus Express on Venus has observed phenomena that occur even on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and windstorms at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is shining.
Now the European probe Venus Express has brought proof - it has captured electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flies from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, wrote in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to the known theory of the formation of primordial matter, lightning may have created life on Earth, and storms are said to have triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the foundation stones of life.
This was not the case on Venus: “If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and there are sometimes temperatures around 500 degrees Celsius.
"Venus may be the hellish twin of Earth, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, began to evolve in a completely different way is a fundamental question of the Asa mission.
Since no spacecraft has been sent to study Venus alone since the early 1990s, the launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of the planet.
According to scientists, the latest results of the research, which brought closer several articles in the journal Nature, not only emphasized the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more Earth-like than previously thought," said Esa.
In addition to the already known windstorms at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that spins considerably faster.
This phenomenon resembles the air currents in the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes the research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth and with a diameter of 12,100 km it is almost the same size.
This planet, known as Dawn or Evening, will orbit the Sun in about 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly around its own axis: one day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not resemble Earth at a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that the two planets were formed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both, but remained in the oceans on Earth, while it evaporated from Venus into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates, it forms most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Bundespräsident Köhler has called for an end to party disputes over the acceptance of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He was indirectly critical of the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is worried about Germany's reputation and calls on the Grand Coalition to end the quarrel over the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves externally as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his sympathy for the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights are universal for me," Köhler said.
The German president stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but that did not prevent him from defending Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a united China.
China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has implicitly expressed his opposition to the Dalai Lama's acceptance and has been attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, of the coalition’s “pre-emptive” foreign policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL magazine, it also froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has urged Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that accepting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China disapproves when European politicians officially accept a Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China’s position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas that are also located on Chinese territory, are trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrest in France
Street fights with police, shootings, burning cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that have erupted in France.
We must do everything to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not escalate into street violence, the Federal Minister of the Interior urges.
The barricades were on fire, rioters fired shotguns at the police, and after serious riots among young people in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful not to create such social tensions in our country, which will erupt into violence.
We have to take it seriously," he told the Hannover newspaper Neue Presse.
It is said that not every young person can cope with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal government, the country and the municipalities are already working hard to resolve the problems, Schäuble said.
It’s not just about integrating migrants.
"From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we have seen first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
In recent nights, teenagers have been fighting police in the northern suburbs of Paris.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
Greater integration efforts of the German government were demanded by the head of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned of a "imitation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "excessively high".
Above all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed: "We must give youths hope."
But the head of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike in France, there is more social control of families.
Moreover, many teenagers from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged, "But we still have to be careful."
We need to "quickly allow young people to start working and learning."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained largely calm.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed, and a helicopter with headlights was flying over the area.
Authorities reported three arrests and several burning garbage cans and cars.
Since yesterday, approximately 1,000 law enforcement forces have taken care of the peace.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
About 80 police officers were injured in a riot in the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The following night, the riots of Toulouse swept over.
The riots were caused by a car accident on Sunday in which two teenagers were killed.
According to preliminary findings of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of juveniles.
In the realm of Angela "Clouds"
The Chancellor’s reality-remote output documents that the coalition is programmatically at an end and that we can expect nothing more from her.
What country does the Chancellor live in?
After her bleak, indifferent-sounding and content-poor speech at the General Debate of the Bundestag, we must state: not here - not in this country, which she is supposed to manage after all.
To the remorse that she is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once replied with a very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, showing she didn't want to understand what the critics were up to.
In the Bundestag, she made it clear to everyone how much she deserved that remorse.
There was no real interest in Merkel, let alone a sense of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Cloud" presented herself: a politician who excels over others, who flees into foreign policy and even there expresses herself only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: he has praised the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit all the time, but no longer says how the climate targets should be achieved in Germany.
And in general, such self-loathing - so much immodesty would have been forgiven by the CDU chairman two years ago.
Now she is confined to empty phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
With this approach, he damages his image of a pragmatic woman who does not need to be flattered because she solves problems.
But in Angela's "Cloud" realm, internal political issues are marginal.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage people?
There are a few other words left on these topics.
It is worth noting how often Merkel is overreacting when it comes to child allowances.
Three times Merkel must start from the beginning in order to be able to say at least partly the right sentence.
As soon as things become too specific, it stumbles like in a completely foreign terrain.
Department of Attack
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates on YouTube in the case of favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney has sparked a heated debate - and both now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident on the first topic.
Mitt Romney blames his rival Rudy Guiliani for making New York a "shelter for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds with a sharp rebuke: "I think his own house was just one such refuge," he responds, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of privately employing undocumented immigrants.
With the Republican base not yet having a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute videos recorded by Internet users and sent via Youtube serve only as such help of a key topic.
“This is the kind of policy of isolationism that allowed Hitler to seize power,” McCain told rival Ron Paul, who is the only one advocating an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain does not spare Romney his remorse for refusing to condemn the tortured method of interrogation called "Waterboarding", which simulates heating.
Public reactions in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are important topics of the campaign.
The audience bursts into applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected.
This will show where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney said, asking the party’s base and television audiences for forgiveness for advocating abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules civilian for the first time
The day after his resignation as commander-in-chief, Pakistani ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Parviz Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday and will remain in office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to honor the constitution and strive for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his post of commander-in-chief to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, in response to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after his oath, fulfilling another of the Western demands.
The country’s Supreme Court, which overwhelmed Musharraf with sympathetic lawyers after declaring a state of emergency in early November, rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6 last week.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
A military spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of krautrock are back
The famous German band of the seventies plays again. Three members of the group Harmonia again grabbed their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the band's most successful period.
At that time, they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation then consists in the performance of three sedentary gentlemen, who at first seem to be just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and especially buttons in front of them.
Thirty-six-year-old Dieter Moebius is sitting in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
37-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who bows down to the synthesizers, is on the right from the viewer’s point of view.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, of course, by mistake, a traditional composition is created.
This does not seem to bother the musicians.
Among lovers of krautrock, the revival of the band Harmonia caused considerable turmoil.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not familiar enough for someone to miss this band painfully for twenty-three years.
But why couldn’t even a German celebrate his still-living legends of the 1970s?
And especially when he values the style of music, mistakenly called krautrock, in England and America more than in his own country.
When the music business awarded the surviving members of the Cologne-based group Can the Echo Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2003, the hall was filled with inquiring views of German pop fans.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their speech, the audience’s amazement knew no bounds.
Michael Rother later sat with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage as an old friend at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
Remembering the Harmonia band unnecessarily overloads the memory, this trio existed for only two years and even at that time it was far from having the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement of the Schaubühne Theater in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at a church-run record company.
Rother briefly assisted Kraftwerk, but only gained a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as members of the commune who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to labor as a nanny.
Rather, it was a life in such a spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir, whose badge was allegedly found in a garbage can.
Much of this has been preserved by Harmony.
The first album was titled "Music from Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Harvesting was not just for self-knowledge.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was said to have been edited during a concert in Griessem in front of a record-breaking small, barely fifty-member backstage.
At the time, Rothera wished that the Harmonia members would go out and exercise occasionally.
For Roedlio and Moebius, it was a completely indecent request.
In 1975, the band announced their breakup.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and insured his future with the album "Burning Heart".
The band Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
For the live album from Griessemer we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record label Grönland set out to keep krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered Roedeli's solo work at the time.
The bodily resurrection of Harmony will take place at the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The Woldtronics Festival performance will be publicly sponsored.
There will be a British, Julian Cope, an old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also be present.
With this, we outlined the overall extent of the influence of krautrock on future pop music.
The empty space of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence, accompanied by the strangest sounds, floats in the hall: "The only true music, the future belongs to it."
There are paintings on which the producer with Harmony is in a peasant sitting.
Also contributing to the creation of the legend is the screening of other black and white photographs, on which a set of devices are wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans were once again busy improvising.
No longer gluing microphones to organs and drums to extract the never-before-heard self-made tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technique of immersion dotters.
This does not change the House of World Cultures.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds and sings "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would find roots rather than blues in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escaping artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmony will not be distracted even now.
Even the most obvious ones are thoroughly thought out on the stage.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This question will either deprive a person of nerves or allow him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
None of them are convincing.
The films either put too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
Not even an actor like Richard Gere can stop it in The Hunting Party.
Good news first: While war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is there, in the gloomy backdrop of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Recently, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he played many attractive, frivolous roles in cool women’s films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the topic of Buddhism, they will take away one’s appetite for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the Hunter Becomes the Prey (Why do movie titles have to be so long and confusing these days?).
His war reporter, Simon Hunt, is essentially what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry hadn’t been so merciful: a man who, although his best years are long past, still retains some remarkable charm as a ruin-like monument.
But despite this triumph, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also hits theaters this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of unsuccessful films about the Balkan war.
This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, after which one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this television shallow film turns into shooting and action too soon.
From the film will remain something very similar to the series Cobra 11, although without a highway, but for that with the war.
The film The Hunting Party can be clearly explored why it has not been possible to make a really good film about the Balkan War so far.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who emulate "the fox", a Serbian war criminal, might have become the new "Apocalypse" at a different time, under the direction of another director and screenwriter (both Richard Shepard).
After all, both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go to the forest to do something that the army is not able to do, but their journey becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the depraved and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the draft also prescribes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party can finally be written off after the reporters in the last five minutes of the film succeed in doing what NATO, the CIA and all the world’s criminal hunters have failed to do in the last five years: catch the criminal and leave him to the righteous revenge of Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth going to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
The film has a profoundly human message.
It denounces the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (they are exceptionally united here) that they are not pursuing the persecution intensively enough on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women come to mind Brecht's famous poem.
There is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer’s desk: “I look with compassion at the swollen veins on my forehead, remarking: how hard it is to be evil.”
Movies like The Hunting Party feature just the kind of swollen heads that suggest how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the topic of the war in the Balkans.
Recently, this newspaper said that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big failures.
One thing is certain: there has never been a good movie about South Africa.
Almost always true: When a star wanders through a crisis area or walks through a minefield, films like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Breakthrough with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio are made.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler's List.
Many films seem to have to mature - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse" or "Lead Vest" - were in no way celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Writers do not have the ability to tell good stories flawlessly.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how horribly the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe they need to form a sarcastic artistic outlook like novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
Asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the "Balkan War", he said: "The only resemblance is that some things never change.
The big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust has been criticized for refusing to host the Olympics.
The mayor’s resignation from hosting the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has been met with fierce criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the organization of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, urges realism in the estimation of chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, called the decision “unfortunate from a business point of view”.
No other project has recently awakened so much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, it would not have been possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm at such a high level.”
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it "based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust said on Wednesday that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Federation will decide on the Olympic bid," von Beust told the newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union will decide on the candidacy of Munich for the Winter Games in 2018.
“This preference means for us that we have no realistic chance with a 2028 timetable.”
Yet this dream is not yet over, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) called von Beust's remarks regrettable.
It seems that Hamburg does not want to run for the Olympics in the next twenty-five years.
"It's too early to destroy the chance by calling the plans buried at this early stage," HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
Abandoning the treatment would be contrary to the statement made by the head of the Senate at the General Assembly of the German Higher Education Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 Universiade as a substitute for hosting the Olympic Games.
Last week, the University Sports Association Hamburg nominated a candidate city.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg Senate parliament said it was wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"Development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered by the Senate for years because it bet on hosting the Olympics and ruled out building apartments," SPD lawmakers Carola Veit and Jan Quast said in a statement.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook area was still planning the Olympics with the idea that the entire area would later be used for residential purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
Applying for the 2012 Summer Olympics aroused great enthusiasm at the time in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, crashed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Anyone who combines the terms Sweden and wooden crates does not think of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Isn't it?
Wooden crates currently manufactured in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
Most of his listed ninety-four "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago, the international market of the "Brillo" of Warhol's "Brillo boxes" of 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo boxes" of the type "Brillo" of the "Brillo" of the Museum of Moderna Museet are also donated to him.
The preceding events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden boxes that were based on the red-blue-white design of paper boxes of Brillo soap powder.
The exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but their masterpieces, mere exhibits.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 for several wooden Brillo crates to be made in Sweden, but they are not on display at Moderna Museet.
The witnesses now speak of fifteen boxes that rightly entered the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred crates were made and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hulten crates were produced in Malmö for the St. Petersburg exhibition only in 1990.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
In addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Museet, also examined three Brillo boxes from a Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood boards were painted with basic paint and oiled with sandpaper.
On the other hand, from the structure of the copies from 1990, it turned out that the paint was applied directly to the plywood board without a previous primer - besides, it is acrylic and not oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official list of Brillo boxes," said Moderna Museet's director, Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to any other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify the material as six boxes of its exhibitions."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would address the “core allegations” raised about soap powder boxes.
The organization remains in relentless silence.
Rebel troops in Manila surrender.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered after they fortified themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Rebel commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulation and corruption in the elections, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had been fortified in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were on trial for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the negotiations to escape with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers who were supposed to be guarding him apparently ran to his side and joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyalty governments have closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president has called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the attack.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We're inviting people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former Scout Rangers elite unit, said more troops would join the march shortly.
Critics of the government have called for major demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Her government has been accused of corruption for months.
Manila’s financial district became the main scene of a rebellion of about 200 troops against Arroyo in 2003.
Because the army refused to join the insurgents, the rebellion failed after less than 24 hours.
At least seven attempts have been made to overthrow a democratically elected government in the Philippines since 1986.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has secured more than 20% of Versatel.
The company said on Wednesday that the average price per share is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14.46.
The company now owns 20.05% of the share capital.
There has been speculation about the takeover.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet announced that it is taking this step to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the company of the Düsseldorf network operator by an additional 5 % to 15,1 %, speculations arose on Wednesday about the entry.
In the financial market, it is said that this money institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had almost a 10% stake in Drillisch, a mobile telecommunications network provider.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch sold an additional 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
Of these, he bought 5.15 million shares for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.4 million from United Internet.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the field of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesperson explained.
In order to take over the competing company Freenet, the companies jointly set up an SME Joint Undertaking.
United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies will be satisfied with a stake of more than 10% in Freenet for the time being and will not exercise their right to take over an additional 18.49% of the business.
For the time being, it is considered that the companies remain open to all possibilities, in particular the possibility of further increasing their stake in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were closed in mid-November.
This months-long and difficult-to-transparent game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contract mobile customers and 1.27 million customers with complete or DSL connections.
United Internet and Drillische hold a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will receive an additional 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of Vatas was agreed in August.
