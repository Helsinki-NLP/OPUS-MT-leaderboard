The Prague Stock Exchange fell to minus at the end of trading
After a sharp fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares have reached almost half of the normal day-to-day business.
The Prague Stock Exchange has been following its Monday decline since the start of trading on Tuesday, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
In our country, too, there is a reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan for stabilization of the financial sector there.
Falling stocks in Asia
Stocks in Asia experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although indices eventually wiped out some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange depreciated almost 4% during trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange were losing more than five percent, but in the end the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan's stock market fell 3.6 percent, according to the Taiwan Stock Exchange Index.
“The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, Hong Kong’s chief monetary officer.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. without dependence on the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should quickly return to talks and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Other countries are also at risk of being affected.
The Bloodbath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to spend up to $700 billion.
The lawmakers ignored President George W. Bush’s call to back the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices saw their biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and fell to a similar extent the last time in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but once it became clear that the motion had failed in the House, the index found itself in a free fall.
Congress backs down: U.S. government could pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance to the US financial system.
The vote on it will be held at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a bailout in the form of $700 billion in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
But it has not yet been won.
Congressmen have to finalize some details of the deal before they can release the final version of the bill and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to the sources, the Senate could vote on the plan first on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
Then, however, there will be a "sobering up" due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which to help the markets to achieve it in practice.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
“We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences on what the shape of the package to stabilize the market should look like,” Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
He said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive shape to the government fund.
It should buy out non-selling mortgage assets from financial companies, which drag financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
The recovery plan still needs to continue, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is hitting stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are seeking a final deal in Congress as early as Sunday.
They are trying to reassure investors from trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first time the Congressional decision could affect Monday’s trading.
However, it is still unclear when the two chambers of Congress will vote on the bill, or whether negotiations at the last minute may be stuck on some problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law still recognizes a number of changes.
The total amount earmarked for aid to the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George W. Bush has demanded.
But Congress may block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not performing its function, in a succession of another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush praises progress in talks
The President may veto the decision, but Congress may override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to get funding to buy bad mortgage securities, the value of which has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, remained.
"We've worked everything out.
“The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said in a statement.
US President George W. Bush is also pleased with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of Gold Parachutes
The chairman of the Senate banking committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on responsibilities for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing relief, and timing of the plan’s funding.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
It should be run by the Treasury Department.
“We have worked very hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be beneficial to the market and to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes assistance for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new instalments for the mortgages it buys in order to reduce monthly instalments costs for borrowers and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to David Mark, chief economist of Patria Finance, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And that's because we don't know what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be redeemed.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government share the losses," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not so important, according to Mark.
"It is much more important that this week the congressmen agree that they support this plan and that they will dedicate it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on approval is the most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
Duel on the edge of the knife: MP3 players against mobiles.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It seems clear from this that it is better to buy only a phone.
Still, there are plenty of reasons to buy a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the claims of the future owner.
It’s probably hard to get a high-end expensive turntable at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
On the one hand, such music products do not come out on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if your shelves are packed with vinyls with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a turntable at least.
It is the same with music on the road, that is, music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan probably will hardly try headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life.
Some high-end music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobile phones don’t happen to do.
No current device is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, it has a better camera, a worse camera, and maybe it can even navigate.
And when you consider smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can take pictures of anything.
The versatility of the mobile also has its disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest eaters of energy.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For low-cost mobile phones, expect that they won’t play for more than a couple of hours.
If you still call in here and there, get another charger to work for sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the worst ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem arises when recording music on a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and moreover, not every one of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but few card readers can handle miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without any reduction.
You don’t need any special software for iPods, except for the exceptions.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and players already create a music library sorted by the name of the artist, album name, genre or user rating.
Some devices display only the directory tree structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with an operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones are more capable
When choosing a specific device, pay particular attention to the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and, of course, the comfort of operation.
If your music is primarily a backdrop and you listen to it every day only briefly, for example, in the tram, you just need any mobile phone that plays MP3.
This is something that almost any mobile phone can do.
You don’t even have to watch too much what music formats your mobile or player can do.
MP3 can handle all and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and in addition to it, the vast majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online, for example.
It is enough to visit the relevant pages of the operator (or another provider) via the mobile Internet and buy the song or album.
This service could already be a powerful argument for the acquisition of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and is usually limited to fast-paced radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their phones around with them.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you can feel the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you also always carry headphones or at least a wired handsfree.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which has almost every mobile phone, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music mobiles will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than $3,000.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent walkman.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output to ordinary headphones.
The best and technically most equipped phones, even with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can be controlled by anyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of control with a previously conventional cassette player or even a turntable is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mistakenly turned on mobile Internet and consequently a huge data transfer bill.
Which device to use
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the appropriate card, you can fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than CZK 1,100.
If you are a more demanding listener, go for specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokias and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is so close to a separate MP3 player.
The farthest away in the industry is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with more memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, a maximum of 35 hours), MP3 players will take you away from the above mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Possibly
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we are missing something here - a virtual operator that would force the classic ones to be cheaper.
Maybe he won't be gone long.
We have written many times on Mobil.cz about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, who pointed out that the price of SMS in our country is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the recent steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are held so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to get into the fight.
It may sound paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and a penetration rate of over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to praise the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often emphasized by the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, who in the past has repeatedly expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network probably does not have much of a chance (after all, it would probably be difficult to find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant reduction in prices, to which even classical operators had to respond.
Even before the introduction of Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile, similar voices were heard in the UK.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
We don’t have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the operator has managed to attract more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
At the same time, Mobilking is backed by the financial group Penta, which owns U:fona in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to be able to work effectively, they need much fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half the price of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, even a bet on a fresh target group can be quite a good move.
This service is specifically aimed at men.
“The right guys choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which runs the virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept as in Poland could be caught up in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
In the Czech Republic without a chance, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for Penta, said in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favour of this idea.
Rather, they are trying to do everything possible to prevent any potential competitors.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been hidden for a long time by the GTS Novera group, which would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of O2 Telephones in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunication services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them," said Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
Maybe he's flashing for better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be waiting perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the emergence of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a complex and serious project in this area," said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the O2 Telephony Press Department in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2: “We have not yet seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further.”
He added: “It’s hard to see a virtual operator on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table in order to be able to think in this short term.”
Vodafone is focusing more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The progress of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and, consequently, a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that operators are able to pull a rope when something is at stake is also evidenced by the quarrels around the formation of U:fon.
Probably the biggest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time of the creation of U:fon by T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the CTU website.
But now U:fon is a good argument for not admitting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and, above all, on his services."
However, given this approach of mobile operators, the complete disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is directly striking.
It is not just the CTU's position, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the power to interfere in competition.
They belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
But he took his typical position on the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator to lease the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential candidates was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," said Kristian Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS in response to our question.
From the representatives of the operators, the statements thus formulated are not likely to surprise.
This is more than a weighted one from an authority that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices are not in the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is truly shocking about the whole case is the touching convergence of the three mobile operators, which follows from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really a coincidence is entirely self-evident.
Just like the exact same price of gasoline at gas stations, it is certainly only the work of chance and fierce competition.
"The Office has not found any signs of anti-competitive conduct in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions in the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to be lacking in the telecom regulator as well," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of a dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets carried out by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is a single market in terms of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - to create a virtual operator, the consent of the network operator is always required.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment, it must necessarily be dominant.
Even if we do not accept this argument, it should be a minimum warning for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that the three mobile operators are acting strikingly similarly.
At the same time, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in dealing with all operators.
Claiming responsibility to the CTU is a fairly common trick in telecommunications, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS keeps its hands off the whole matter.
We’ve met him on several similar occasions.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act did not succeed in enforcing the extension of CT<0xC3><0x9A>’s powers to competition in telecommunications, despite the fact that many experts had promised to improve the situation.
This must be more than well known to the representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It goes when no one's looking
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudovirtual operators, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that issue their own price lists of mobile phone services, which, however, are only partially public.
This is usually done by multi-level marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company faces the operator as a classic business customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, he will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If there are cases that you are talking about, it could be a violation of the terms and conditions that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such activity would not reach the responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are opposed to such a procedure.
They make significant profits from the activities of these companies and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as regular customers of mobile operators.
This is what should be at least weird.
In addition, another question for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS opens up.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has quite strong powers to detect similar activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators that they have no idea about this and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable drop in service prices.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried more or less to prevent their emergence.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at these moments that regulators intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created and more were added to it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities dismiss the whole case as a hot potato.
From our experience, we can not get rid of the impression that the ambiguity in competences is more than suitable for them in these cases.
But let's not throw the flint in the rye.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator is really coming soon, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If one of the operators admitted the emergence of a virtual mobile operator, it will hardly be possible for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling it more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home on the occasion of the Czech Statehood Day.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choral and instrumental versions.
The song was performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The anthem was edited by Otakar Jeremia<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
He has previously told Czech Radio that he has deliberately chosen singers with young representative voices that are expressive and popular for singing solo variations.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them, and then the choir, had a clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they were in agreement," he said.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where is my home was first played in 1834 on the boards of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it for their own.
After the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the formation of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the “new” anthem?
Prague public transport will drive on chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will board the subway, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, he can buy about a hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have it uploaded to their chip card in the information centers and workplaces of the Transport Company at the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Kobylisy, Rajská<0xC5><0x99> Garden, Ka<0xC4><0x8D>rov and Lu<0xC4><0x8D>.
Coupons can also be purchased online from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers took advantage of the service in the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the dispensing windows in the subway stations, where until now they had to regularly stand in long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon online and upload it to their Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"At these places, a counter with trained staff is available to passengers, which will help interested parties with online purchases and also upload the purchased coupon to their card," said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, a spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard in self-service vending machines, which are mounted in several subway vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket markers, and passengers may have already noticed them at Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are five of them in the city now, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," he added.
The coupon checks the driver's place vending machine
The operation of the machines that will start working tomorrow is simple.
Just insert an Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it itself.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which travel to the capital mainly residents of Central Bohemian municipalities.
"On the trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers, with which they determine the time and band validity of coupons," explained Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid, which compiles the timetables of Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the cash register of the driver.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to a designated place on the side of the cash register.
This allows the driver to check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers uploaded, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drapal added.
Passengers who do not travel by suburban buses and will not remember when their coupon expires can go back to the self-service vending machines, where coupons are uploaded to the card.

The Sudanese have called for a referendum on the United States.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans demanded the incorporation of <0xC5><0xA0>umava into the United States.
It comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is evidenced, among other things, by a letter that was preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in a letter from the US President not to allow the return of the "<0xC5><0xA0>umava County" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly, and we want to be really sure in words that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads, signed with the words "People who care about the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava".
Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia allegedly gives the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - hope only of brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the American President ask that he take over the <0xC5><0xA0>umava Protectorate for present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would grant this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and refutes minorities and has done nothing to contribute to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president allegedly doubted the attitude of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava county on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve in today’s knowledge of post-war history, according to some historians, it adequately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans must have at least suspected that it would be about their expulsion from the republic, few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetens.
Others believed they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was during the war like a Budweiser German deployed to the navy in the Baltic.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prisoner of war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, they would need Czech," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, did not expect to be expelled from the republic on the basis of Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
You don't think you'll pay!
Emotional campaign will attack the driver
The most expensive road safety event in Czech history.
That’s the kind of emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to deter the driver from dangerous behavior at the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage the driver from speeding and alcohol at the wheel.
And remind them that before they leave, they should bind themselves.
He wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the sketchbook.
And in a pool of blood, there's the word "you'll pay."
This is supposed to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of inattention with his own life.
Spectators will be "haunted" until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of accident victims are commonly seen.
It promises to reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip on the driver
"The driver has a system of sugar and whips.
Sugar for them is that if they go on a red light, for example, it saves time.
A whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, a traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce hospital.
That is why there is a need for information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, says the psychologist.
The signs that alert drivers to the dangers are already less effective.
"If a static warning board is installed, it will probably soon merge with the surrounding area and drivers will not pay attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by the daily Jediot Ahronoth on Monday.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give a similar percentage to the Palestinians, because without that there will be no peace," he said.
He said that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and in particular does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites" that lie inside the Old City.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he added.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, an indispensable condition for a peace deal with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I am not proposing to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to win over the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah; they will have to give up the continued support they provide to Hamas, al-Qaeda and jihad in Iraq.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, you can not walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arose whether stewards and passengers could move on the bus while driving.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward's activities are contrary to the law on road traffic," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The crash, in which a 22-year-old stewardess was killed last week, was apparently caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least secure seat in the car, although there were two other seats left.
However, the bus can crash or brake violently, even when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus, according to the technical certificate, is equipped with places to stand.
If it is not approved on the bus, the passenger must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have a place to stand; which Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz also confirmed the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"This was discussed with the Ministry and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
We then called it off and came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while riding, if they have their own seat," he said.
The steward doesn't know the law.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward's role - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the term driver of the vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds less unequivocally the spokesperson Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, Director of the Department of Road Vehicles at the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law treats the issue sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus in the approval is allowed places for standing.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are parking spaces and limited maximum speed, intercity with parking spaces with higher permissible speed, and long-distance without parking spaces with maximum permissible speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on an airplane, says an expert
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín, BESIP traffic safety expert, does not see a major problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"There are not many dangers when driving smoothly, the situation can be compared to a service on airplanes.
Even here it is not certain when the turbulence will come and the stewardess may hit her head."
"But if the bus brakes too fast, of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or tram.
The safety of stewards must be handled by the carrier in accordance with internal regulations," he says and also means that from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to cancel the service
Student Agency offers the services of stewards as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the stewardship is risky, I'll cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can be provided to passengers upon check-in.
It would also save costs,” he said.
Director of Asiana Alexei Litvin, which operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA, explained the lack of stewards in his cars as an interest in safety.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been up against it since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There was an enormous tragedy
A young stewardess from Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years, was killed in an accident on a line to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably deflected from the parking lane and blocked the way of the bus.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he hit him with the right front.
Two seats reserved for the stewards were sold out, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses.
"These places cannot be reserved on long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company is going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for a court order, but it also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Modification of the law?
Not in sight
A regulation of the law on which a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport is working for over a year could clarify the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"It has not come to any concrete conclusion.
Buses do not even solve much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says the expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concluded, saying that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and labor safety authorities.
The hope of Dusseldorf is Frankfurt
Great words in the letter of the management of WestLB to the employees of this bank are not lacking.
The merger of the units of the Düsseldorf-based monetary institution with the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank will create "the central institution of the financial group of savings banks for trading on the capital markets," reads the letter, which was made public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will add a "set of competencies" to this transaction, ensuring long-term revenues.
In general, such a merger can be a decisive impetus for further association in the sector of land banks.
Such texts arise when the Board of Directors wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose message to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which the customers of savings banks know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
The head of Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, told reporters at the end of August that he saw no point in merging his Mainzer Landstraße banking house with one of the Landesbanks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Management Board of Deka-Bank, which is backed by half of the Landesbank and the other half by the Savings Bank Association, instructed the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be capital market transactions or part of them.
But the talks have only just begun, financial experts say.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a while that there could be a merger between Deka-Bank, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
In the end, nothing came of this trio.
Shortly after the plans for the merger were made public, the Hessian state government opposed Helaba's participation.
Neither of the other two banks were able to do so.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, there have been repeated speculations about the connection of Deka-Bank with the country’s banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba Bank, has expressed his negative opinion on the speculation about linking his financial house with others.
However, independently, it seems that the belief that the convergence of the various banking houses of the public sector is a necessity is ripening.
Now after the elections to the Landtag in Bavaria, the connection of BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to start.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers is to increase, it is gradually losing potential partners for such a merger.
In the south, only the second violin would be played, despite the fact that they are facing the financial crisis much better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Association of Savings Banks and Gira Banks of Hessen-Thüringen, which holds an eighty-five percent stake in Helaba, banned its connection with WestLB.
This would be the case for Nord LB at the most.
However, geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, the question is how much the business models of individual institutions match.
In June, Merl said that the crucial question of what kind of business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the Landesbanken has not yet been answered by the German Association of Savings Banks and Gyr Banks.
It could also end up with the WestLB distribution, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
That is why the letter of the local board of directors also mentions that they are trying to find a “comprehensive solution” for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect with the connection of individual folders with Deka-Bank will show time.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with Italy"
It's the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena will be there as his girlfriend, and so everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter Kaiser barrel, stands a thicker beard and two hundred tourists at the Oktoberfest proves how deep the tone of his throat can give.
Elena claps Luca first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova Station, four buses will leave this evening at 23.45 with the sign "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses are occupied mainly by Italians, while one bus is occupied exclusively by Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, they were already celebrating at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who is wearing a long coat with a lining of imitation fur and glasses with wide silver frames, belongs to the three buses.
He has been travelling with them to Oktoberfest for five years, but this year alone he is organizing three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between beer stands, at 22.30 departure back.
Staying overnight would only entail unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 including a welcome toast with Kaiser beer, brewed exactly according to the Bavarian beer purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave at night, taking the highway towards "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus quickly shuts down, the passengers are asleep.
They're doing well, they're going to need their strength.
It stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where it takes another break on the motorway number 8 just outside Munich and many other buses with an Italian license plate.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at a parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco makes a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On the left is written "Oktoberfest" in German, next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" cries Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and fill the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so as not to obstruct, and not all the yellow caps on the same bench, spread out over the space!"
Mint costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that we're being polite.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third: "Tonight, at exactly 11:30, be here again!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, a place with beer tents.
Along the way, a member of the group hangs yellow hats as markers on trees, signs and even on the election poster of a major Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
The "weekend with Italy" is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest.
The exact number of visitors is not available; it is said that 50,000 of those who set out on a journey across the Alps and fall into beer tents, 10% of all visitors this weekend came from Italy.
The Munich police will reinforce seven police officers from South Tyrol, while Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps national statistics, in which Italians take first place before the British (approximately 60 interventions) and Austrians (approximately 80) with about 200 medical treatments.
Especially popular with Italians is the tent Hofbräu.
Sleepless nights for lenders Hypo Real Estate
Last week, Bundesfinanzminister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this politician used the word "relatively" and included in his statement the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared the development of the crisis.
Because it happened last weekend.
Dax-based real estate finance firm Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a multi-billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance would go up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will have to pay interest only on the amount actually spent.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financier refinanced the long-term projects for which he was lending money for an extremely short-term, which is now impossible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserves shrank by 95% to EUR 2.37 million and the equity ratio slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current and net financial trading earnings fell to zero compared to the previous year, while earnings from the increased value of receivables and certain securities, as well as from the abolition of credit-trading provisions, fell by more than 70 per cent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million.
Only through higher revenues from compensation for the subsequent clearing costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the reimbursement of interest under the tax code and for the facilitation of trade for the group companies was the 16% decrease on the revenue side still moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier burned himself on mortgages for entrepreneurs, which were then separated from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Because there was too little money to be made in classical state financing, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private-public-partnerships (PPPs) and diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate now has to write something down, and these write-offs will have a “essential material effect” on the calculation of the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have indefinitely heard.
The fact is that there will be no dividend.
It was cut by two-thirds in 2007.
Since the acquisition of Depf, Hypo Real Estate has been an important financier for state and infrastructure projects.
More strongly than other institutes, it depends on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans practically dried up as banks guarded their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for a part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion – annually.
According to the Hypo Real Estate statement, the group’s financial need is covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected “from the influence of international money markets currently largely incapacitated function”.
Other sources have been told that this money will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE Chairman Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to take advantage of the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the Hypo Real Estate Group’s competitiveness in the market is now assured.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and lenders are hoping for.
But given the dynamics and imperceptibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely excluded that the loan would not need to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank appeared to be facing insolvency late on Sunday afternoon, the rescue fails to appease passions, albeit provisionally.
The stock price fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond rates were held well.
While preference debt has remained virtually unchanged, secondary bond rates are losing significantly.
This mainly concerns the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, logically, bonds with a maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability should be understood depending on the stability of the international financial system after the significant exacerbation of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it into the company with the takeover of Depf.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the repayment of securities within their maturity period.
But there may also be something that almost no one dares to hope for now - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now become mere legitimate hope.
This, especially for long-term creditors, is likely to prepare a series of waking nights in which they will decide whether to waive their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the marginal line at least to make a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to exchange rate earnings of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the secret of the bento box
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop introduces herself on her first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls begin to grin: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows this word from the manga. In her new blog about the exchange, she talks about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take a 40-minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way, fortunately I wasn’t lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not given as strictly as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight o’clock, and twenty minutes before nine a short session with the teacher begins, the so-called ‘home room’.
But before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I wore my host mom’s old skirt, plus a blouse, blue stockings and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sajónar Wo <0xC5><0xA1>e Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and in a week it is my birthday.
At that moment, I was very happy that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, giggling and waving, and I kept hearing the word 'kawaii'.
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly jumped into my seat.
The girl next to me smiled wide enough, considered it an honor that a foreign student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was relatively calm, but when the gong rang, I literally fell asleep.
They were talking through each other and giggling and asking me questions about the possible and the impossible — and yet it was really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their bents.
My host mother also made me a lunch box like this - and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and some kind of fish in tofu pastry.
I don’t know what I’m eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except for the salty plums, bro!
Benta in Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a hand-made bento, which in this case is especially artistically modified, and hopes to get to know the boy better at a snack during the break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here too.
'Why Japan?' asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
I have been reading manga for years.
And to get a better understanding of these comics and their culture, I started learning Japanese one day.
It was clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and habits.
And they are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
When a rat or cockroach runs from danger, does that mean they feel fear too?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals have feelings.
But how can we verify whether they feel the same way when they behave like us?
The online journal "Edge" has been publishing contributions from well-known scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else has not yet been able to prove, when we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we begin to focus on another kind and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter into impassable terrain, because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it will do the same as many other animals: pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
Humans behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude that there are comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
This is because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its contribution to short-term memory and execution or control functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them knowing who we are and being able to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be concealed by the linguistic essence of a person: because so much of his perception is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we can exclude animals.
But even if the consciousness of language did not matter, it would certainly be influenced by language, so that animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to know what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, due to special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, we are faced with great problems in exploring it.
Most of my inferences relate to the content of conscious experience, but besides that, there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to study processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, pursued by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on neural correlates of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the nefrontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I deduce them from the fact that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
What we call “fear” is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) makes use of operative memory.
Viewed from this angle, feelings are closely related to those areas of the cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially humans.
In connection with the linguistic nature, there is a subtle gradation of perception, because with the help of words and grammar, we can distinguish and categorize states, so that we can attribute them to others.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in areas of the cortex and brain stem devoted to bodily sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily participate in the feelings perceived by several animal families.
Purely theoretically, I can't argue with that, but I think it's inconclusive.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt by both organisms alike: But how can it be verified, Pankseep goes on to say, whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The cockroach is fleeing from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, mere similarity of behavior cannot prove consistency of experience.
It is true that neural comparisons move us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, whereas cockroaches and brains do not.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in humans: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how I'm supposed to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and language), I study emotional behavior rather than the emotional perception of rats.
Anyway, in this case, we can see progress at the neural level if we measure the same thing in rats and in humans.
Like rats, I do not study language and consciousness, nor do I study feelings, for I do not know if they exist.
It may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Deadline of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be led directly by the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries."
In the early fulfillment of the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts limp.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," Grigory Surkis, the president of the Ukrainian Union, said.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical move was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN was dismissed by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport, Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that this step will not hurt preparations for Euro 2012."
Several teams from the first league were condemned to a forced descent due to manipulations only last season, in the end the start of the league had to be moved quickly.
Infuriated Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to do a commercial for a new movie, talked in an interview about private affairs - and now she's having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke of her former Dennis Quaid as the pervert of marriage.
It rages and strikes back.
The Delayed War of the Roses of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are having an ugly argument - in front of the public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan said, “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that has been very painful.”
She said she only learned about the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The stimulus for this psychic striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film, "The Women," which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was striking: “It’s crazy,” the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that “Meg has repeatedly chewed through the history of our relationship and adjusted it.”
In addition, it is “deplorable” that the joint 16-year-old son, Jack, is once again “publicly reminded of the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become the father of twins.
He concludes his reflections on the bias: "My life goes on anyway.
I feel lucky to have a wonderful family that is doing great.”
Prices of flights and hotels are falling.
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even 50% cheaper, according to one recent study.
Flights and hotel accommodations have come down again – this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its data on reservations made in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already become cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most noticeable trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the weak dollar exchange rate has caused a “declining desire of American tourists to travel”.
The fall in hotel prices has also affected financial centres more than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices have even set a European record with a 26.3% increase.
Ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, for fuel-intensive long-haul flights even increased by up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the price of Economy-class tickets fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but the changes in Business and First-Class were less noticeable.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, they increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, prices fell by half, according to the study.
One of the reasons for this price decline is the slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit airlines by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one gate and simple methods, Hamburger SV is at the forefront of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay still fails to assemble a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - Enhance Failed Landing for Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach got into the game late and failed with a stick balloon.
His message was precisely formulated and sounded convincingly from his mouth.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger hissed in the hallway to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much was happening in the catacombs, the half-time break was over, and most people were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for HSV for almost three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb as a sign of agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg coach Martin Jol.
His order probably sounded similar: here with the second goal!
There was no execution.
"Everything was not well looked at here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wished it "more relaxed".
For 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers owe the head of Mladen Petri<0xC4><0x87> (11th) and the circumstances that very weak Gladba<0xC5><0xA1>an could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will celebrate its 121st anniversary this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a lively updated table on the video wall, in which their team was listed as the winner.
It's gonna be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the current table result symbolizes the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petri<0xC4><0x87> and FC Bayern won Jansen - is slow to find, but still can not shine.
"We need more emotion and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
After the defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to fall by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in a single day in his history.
Later, Dow gained some weight again.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer showed a 5% drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was minus 1548 points with more than seven percent.
The worst was in the Dow at this point, American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America, with a loss of about 12 percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Goldman Sachs has lost nearly 10% of its shares.
A few days ago, Warren Buffett was a major investor in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is to receive shares of financial companies that could be repaid if the exchange rate were to improve, thus reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stocks in Europe are falling sharply
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the U.S. does not relieve investors of doubt.
The stock exchange rate of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly downwards and draws the Dax index with it.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have dragged the German stock index (Dax) deep into the negative.
The shares of the Munich real estate financier have lost up to three-quarters of their value, and Commerzbank has lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important threshold of 6,000 points, and with a minus of 3.7 percent, he scored 5,839 points.
All over the world, the stock markets have gone to their knees.
In New York, the trading day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package may not be enough to revive financial markets.
In the first hour of trading, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is due to vote on the bailout plan, and the Senate may vote on it on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also went in only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s leading Nikkei index fell by 1.26% after initial gains to 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and trade ended at 12,595.75.
In MDAx, the shares of Arcandor were lost after the announcement of the increase in the share capital.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourism group has announced that it will not sell its shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have not been able to cope with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft flew through space.
The fault of the fuel lines, which will soon freeze, now threatens her death by cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists - the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot.
A gravitational slingshot is an aerial maneuver of space probes in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space body, such as Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens spacecraft used this physics trick in the same way as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case is astonishing: flying objects do not behave 100 percent as one would expect according to the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They christened him the Anomaly of the Gravity Sling.
Several experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was right, and is trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot using so-called dark matter, the presence of which in the universe has been detected by astronomers.
"This anomaly could be caused by dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space scientists have known about the existence of dark matter for only about ten years.
Obviously, it emanates from the gravitational force, the effect of which on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, this dark matter makes up a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their abductors, the Italian foreign minister said the abducted tourists were back at large in Egypt.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
In the shooting before the release, six kidnappers were reportedly killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom talks are said to be underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists dragged into the Sahara seem to be free.
Egypt’s state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media reported on the incident.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're just checking their health," Frattini said.
According to an Egyptian state television report, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the abduction before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed the six kidnappers.
"The problem is solved.
They agreed to the ransom," the employee said.
He said it was "just a matter of taking the hostage" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot dead six kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and two of them were captured.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", citing one of the German mediators, said the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostage after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse by stepfather "leaded to suicide"
Several years of abuse by the stepfather led the woman to commit suicide, the court said.
After confessing to eight cases of sexual harassment, 57-year-old Michael Trerise of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in his confession.
The court also said Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her and sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, Ms. Randle, who had spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the spectre of abuse she had been subjected to twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in court that in 2006 friends of Ms. Randle, who was also very much involved in surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and "had given up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She is believed to have suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle came face to face with his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession ending with the words, "I tied her up and blindfolded her.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris: “You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been awful for your victim when she was just seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she had not done so, the matter would probably not have gone to court at all.”
"I would especially like to emphasize the consequences that Stephanie's parents believe your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he said.
"Evidently, otherwise she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on the train to Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Department of Defense.
The documents got into the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the least serious offense against the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defence affairs correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the government office," he said.
An employee who may not be appointed is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police indict the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret analyses of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an unknown location.
Cooperative reserves face debt of B&B
After the rescue of Bradford & Bingley, the British cooperatives may have to deal with debt of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative pledges.
The director-general of the Cooperative Trusts Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was “humiliating” that reserves and their members had to pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be repaid by bailing out the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, interest, which in the meantime will be accumulated, will be repaid each year by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Money Service Compensation Fund for the BBC has confirmed that all 59 cooperatives are included in this number.
It is humiliating that these institutions that have behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were far from so prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that reserves should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on debt will rise to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
That means reserves will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay back interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the cooperatives trade association, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
“It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved prudently during the boom of the housing market now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were far from so prudent.”
According to the BSA, no backups have fallen since 1945, when they appeared.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what options are available to protect cooperatives and their members from an account that could be substantial," Cole added.
Interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be repaid for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since cooperatives are equity organizations without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
The price of milk is five pence per liter.
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second increase in prices this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves if they want to reflect the increase in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Bangladeshi Prime Minister's Bail Rejected
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajid’s request for bail, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to her homeland.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail on charges that she had obtained more than fifty million taka ($729,700) from a businessman by blackmail when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption allegations brought against it.
Khalida Ziya, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the local government, held by the army, first give her complete freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was released on parole to undergo medical treatment abroad, it is unclear whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh, according to the terms of her release.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the Supreme Court ruling to the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail on the grounds that she does not need bail when she is already undergoing an examination abroad released for a statement of honor," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said in a statement.
"We will appeal the Supreme Court's order."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to be able to return to the country from abroad in preparation for the December elections.
A senior member of the People’s League said Sheikh Hasina was due to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the army-held interim government seized power, but was released from prison in June to allow her to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khalid Ziya both deny all charges against each other.
Fear of Polio Vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated against polio due to Taliban-related violence.
The United Nations carried out vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, she says she was unable to reach the children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for safety reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it had done so despite promises by the Taliban not to attack or hinder thousands of vaccine workers at work.
BSkyB loses ITV lawsuit
BSkyB lost a legal dispute over the review of the Competition Commission’s decision ordering it to reduce its shareholding in the competing broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB’s Competition Court of Appeal ordered it to reduce its stake in ITV from 17,9 % to below 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB’s participation hindered competition and gave the company a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB acquired a stake in a store in 2006, which as a result prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the FAB announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB had raised doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin consortium chairman Sir Richard Branson, consumer organizations and Ofcom regulator were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its stake in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution – mainly because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorneys Affair
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came in a situation where a report on the affair prepared by the chief inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Justice Minister Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in a statement: “Serious allegations, including potential criminal conduct, have not been fully investigated or clarified.”
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. lawyers of their posts in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the lawyers were fired due to poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the dismissed lawyers were not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissals were politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican lawmakers and senators, while others refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
U.S. lawyers investigate and prosecute government cases.
They may be released at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
At the time, the head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the dismissals and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The Inspector General’s report was very critical of Gonzales’ role in the affair, saying he was “principally responsible” for the redundancies, “abdicated” from his leadership position, and “notably not involved”.
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will attend the ceremony for his special gold award next weekend in London, said he was "honored" by the award.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year’s nomination is led by Coldplay, which has been shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand above things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed large vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and peaked at number 15.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell held the chart for about nine years and sold more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - Marvin Lee Aday's real name - has been suffering from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was operated on for an irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others only commercial.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have trouble finding an Extra Place, mostly because they’ve never heard of it.
This little alley is in the East Village district and leads north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic jam.
There are no signs with street names.
In an atlas, it is virtually invisible.
However, the street has admirers.
For example, the company Avalon Bay, the developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
Extra Place wants to re-pave and create a cleaner passageway to the shops and boutiques that are to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were enchanted by the shortened alley simply because it was one of the last remnants from the time the block was ennobled.
However, the city's Office for the Protection and Development of Buildings, which has the street in its power, has not the slightest interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the land committee of the municipality, representatives of the city authority and the company Avalon Bay outlined a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the district manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee favors the option of keeping the street in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain its property," she said.
"Proposals for repair and administration could be made, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to re-pave the small street and settle in seats, several of which would be used by the cafe, whose interest in renting space developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first announced at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily own it.
“The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this desolate alley and make it a beautiful place for the public,” she said, adding that the sale was suggested by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office for the Conservation of Buildings, said the city did indeed want to sell the street, noting that his office's job was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn’s large farm was divided among several of his children, and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The Extra Place was led by the back door of the CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, and the alley is perhaps best known as the background photo on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
“The place was amazing,” says Danny Fields, Ramones’ manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the upgrading of the East Village neighborhood, oppose the idea of selling the Extra Place and argue that that piece of public property, however modest, should remain public.
Others consider the Extra Place a rarity – a nearly unchanged piece of town that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's Disappearing New York (with the subtitle "The Book of Lamentations: A bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction"), posted part of the Extra Place story from the Talk About the City section, which appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even in the daytime, and bounded by rusty iron warehouse doors and banged-up windows, where a week-old newspaper runs through the gutters."
With a few exceptions, the aisle looked exactly the same one night.
The rat ran across the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where today's expensive clothing store stands.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh batch of dumped newspapers was an empty beer bottle.
A few passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place, but suggested he might need a boost.
Fields, on the other hand, said he thinks some people underestimate the impressiveness of the alley in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have been in dark, wet and disgusting places."
Bilingualism debate: immersion in English
In this issue of Focusing on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss candidates’ attitudes towards bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic in California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools.
Effectively addressing Hispanic voters is a tricky matter.
Barack Obama’s educational agenda only proves this.
Obama’s campaign notes that “African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat such performance gaps, Obama’s educational agenda particularly promotes, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for those just learning English.
The question is whether Barack Obama’s commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is not stronger than his interest in reducing the performance gap.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles County East.
In the vast majority of cases, the students of this school are Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Nevertheless, in the state tests in mathematics in 2008, an incredible one hundred percent of fourth-grade students reached the highest level.
Ninety-three percent of fourth-grade students reached the highest level in the state tests of English language and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a different method than the one preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities, and an approach without excuses.
Further, and that should be noted by Obama, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s pedagogical approach for those just learning English is “total immersion.”
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me, "We had a tremendous success with one brand-new student from Mexico -- after twelve months, you would walk into the classroom and not know which one it was."
"It's working," she said, "for us."
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model of what other schools with large proportions of Hispanic and English-learning students should look like?
The school’s achievements should make the answer to this question a matter of course, but its own party’s educational agenda (the National Educational Association is a longtime advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education obscure the prediction of Obama’s answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter by saying that people should stop worrying about “only English” laws.
Instead, “you should make sure your children speak Spanish,” he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance gaps, he should think carefully about educational patterns that work rather than ridicule and trivialize them.
Oil declines sharply due to renewed economic worries
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the U.S. plan to bail out financial markets might not revive the economy.
Oil futures prices fell by up to 7% in the morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange to $99.80 per barrel.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial unrest on Wall Street and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, again leaping on the wave of enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety again gripped investors on Monday, even after the presidency of Congress announced it had reached an agreement on the largest bailout plan in history over the weekend.
This report has been overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the advancing decay, the government announced that Citigroup would buy the banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the furious weekend talks that led to the plan to bail out the economy “prove to be unable to revive market sentiment.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlook for markets with global stocks, interest rates and exchange rates has been strongly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the infection.
“From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the U.S. virus will spread throughout the world, and especially to China.”
Analysts cut their expectations for next year as oil consumption declined due to slower economic growth, and cut their forecasts for gasoline prices for 2009 by about 20%.
Wild riding in the second quarter beat the team's record
After spending more time at the Jets than anyone else in the last eight seasons, defenseman Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then on Sunday he followed the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a pointless game into a spaniel ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals leveled the grim clouds above each other with their agonizing game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Coles to the 12-yard touchdown sprint, perfectly anticipating an afternoon in which their evolving collaboration moved miles ahead.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter for another two touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before the half of the match.
"It was nothing special," Favre told Coles about all his passes.
“He’s a damn good player.
We communicated well, no matter what people thought.”
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense was attacking Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray throw and returned it 32 yards to the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner into a fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-billion-dollar goal out of the field, taking the lead 34-0.
That's the most the Jets have ever won in a quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
There were a lot of points in a short period of time.”
The rested Gebreselassie improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and became the first person to run a 26.2-mile race under two hours and four minutes.
Winning on a pleasantly flat track in 2:03:59, he beat his previous time of 2:04:26, which took place last year in Berlin, by 27 seconds.
Gebreselassie, 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is really incredibly wide - he broke the world record or at least is the world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing because he feared — perhaps too frightened in retrospect — that air pollution would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish line - Gebreselassie won Sunday with a lightning fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on longer tracks, the marathon record for the past decade has fallen by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in a time of 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters he had calf cramps two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Apparently, the pause woke him up rather than delayed him.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago and I was a little doubtful today, but everything was fine.”
He has also been criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for over-planning his races, generally avoiding the world's top marathon races, relying on drivers as if it were a race on the track, and setting world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie’s enormous running qualities.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached half in 1:02:04.
After the drivers fell off, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little before three miles before the goal Gebreselassie last took and escaped Kwambai, who then ran in second place in 2:05:36, improving his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenkova, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, finished an excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain.
The 36-year-old Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nková won the London Marathon in 2:24:14 last spring.
She skipped the Beijing Games due to what was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin, and in the third marathon she ever ran, she improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race cleverly and deliberately: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape in a big lead and then dragged them out after about 18 1/2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop from Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The Pride and Obstacles of Black Lives in a Separate City
Hidden among the sprawling amusement parks of the larger Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and gigantic, lies a quiet city where the pride and demands of African-American life come to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of kwajawa, no schools."
It is now a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Eatonville's annual Dawn! festival to pay tribute to Hurston, Harlem's most famous female writer of the Renaissance.
The city she described remains aside, though she made it a stop for tourists by including it in a Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers Project during the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year in which the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion of races, many residents remain wary of the views of others.
“We pay a lot of attention to how our story is told,” says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of black ascension and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also an oak-shaded example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that arose from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the locals are both proud and protective.
And worries about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way Hurston is called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of dialects such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida Tourist Guide turned the city into a shortcut to Highway 17, which runs through Florida’s often-missing downtown area, into a stage of black history and human drama.
With the bang of the big drum in her life and literature, Hurston led her readers to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "there is a white-brown-decorated modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned Dash’s new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn “sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits an hour-long hotel.”
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
This was clearly not a typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson Girls choirs who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang obscene songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chipper eccentric, who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of the time, when she landed in the city, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud of its dignified dress.
Most residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were sneering.
"People have always been happy to see Dawn," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, “she never stayed too long.”
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville and the rest of the world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major funeral ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood her meaning for the world or her legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography Wrapped in Rainbows.
The change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to run a five-lane highway through the city instead of Kennedy Boulevard, the local two-lane main road.
Orlando's rampage has already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the race-mixing struggle brought hatred to the doorstep of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white guys, they came and threw oranges and stuff at the people who sat on the side," Franklin said.
"Actually, we had a lady here who was killed by it.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration and said its decision in Brown v. the Education Chamber was "offensive rather than glorified to my race."
Residents now claim that school desegregation, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of local youth.
"The Negro children were used to hugging - I remember that - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This continued until teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher -- I mean, there's a cultural barrier," Miss Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, rose above prejudice with frivolous self-confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to the unmarked tomb of Hurston and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a celebrated biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway came to the shelves of bookstores, re-introducing it into the American canon.
The project with the highway arrived just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter found the lights of the ramps again.
The Hurston's former neighbors now considered her a savior.
To show what it can do with its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived for the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"These five highway streams resurrected, you'd say, a real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd put it simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the motorway project helped change the image of the city.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started attending the church in 1993, began to appear in larger numbers, and residents began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historic Register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 on the re-asphalted and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes act like a downed alley in summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Nowadays, 90 percent of them are black.)
Strangers who come looking for the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is required in advance, and certain things — like wall paintings in the oldest Eatonville church painted by whites and depicting blacks in the fields — are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a bold, confident teacher who likes deep red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as Hurston’s festival grew, so did domestic pride.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, troubled, and so on, but not better, not worse, and as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish, and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, there is a sincere love for the village as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police, which he says would benefit from some help.
And even younger ones, such as the 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they pass by, think, 'Uh, this town is nothing compared to the others,'" said Alondra Kenon recently after church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we're all fluent in finance.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan had stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not have realized they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in the glazed beehive of offices above their heads, every day the bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York have the worst “bad day in the office” since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers still roar metal carts on the sidewalks and carry the muffin bakers to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics still move between the towers and wear, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts hanging from the pendulums on their backs.
Office rats are still queuing for their morning bagel at the street food stalls, and it's still not possible to get a yellow cab between four and seven in the afternoon on a weekday.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to open a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had timed this assignment to cover the late afternoon siesta at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, there were already about twenty people waiting in line.
Not in front of cash desks to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of a counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for a way to Macy’s mixed goods store, and new customers open accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my “licensed personal banker,” came for the same reason I did.
But they have already taken their savings from smaller banks in places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They have withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (slightly similar to building savings banks), money associations, and those types of savings banks whose branches operate only in one state, which claim to care for their customers as a family.
Over the past year, 15 such banks have quietly gone bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers returned home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, the Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
The office and shop workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were transferring their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe haven and that does most of the rescuing on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluent financial language over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket was talking on the phone to Lehman Borthers, that bankrupt bank, and to her slender chief executive, Dick Fulda, with such familiarity as if she were gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed, about 50-year-old housekeeper of my apartment, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation -- Brad, Angelina, or my grocery delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in money market funds.
I moved it, I won't take any chances."
Muslim tombs desecrated after Austria's right-wing crack
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, of the Austrian right-wing Free Party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party, are attending a rally in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to present the organization "Cities Against Islamization".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs, showing mosques crossed by a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right parties made huge gains in general elections.
More than 90 graves at the Traun cemetery near Linz were severely damaged sometime between Friday evening and this morning, and police are convinced it was an organized action.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols on some graves, such as the Star of David, but the detectives are convinced that it may have been an attempt to disguise the motives of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was in any way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the Muslim community said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of defilement as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan drew to a close.
In the meantime, Austria is entering the round of searching for its own soul after the right-wing collapse in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which together garnered more than 30 percent of the vote, the Free Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led a vehement anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the chairman of the Free Party, which received over 18 percent of the vote, protested against scarves and burqas in the campaign and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the far right in the position of the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this change was caused mainly by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glam rock star who was convicted of child sexual abuse, has been barred from traveling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed the six-month ban on Glitter after he informed monitoring authorities that he planned to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent Police Department approved the travel ban last Thursday after handing over evidence of Glitter’s past convictions for child sexual abuse to officials.
Glitter, his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the Judicial Service said: “On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford’s lowest criminal court, the Kent police asked for an order to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally involved.”
Glitter, 64, has informed authorities that he wishes to travel abroad, according to his record in the register of sexual offenders.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also give the planned departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he fails to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent Police have said they will not discuss Glitter's possible travels to the county.
A Kent Police spokeswoman said: "The Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to track someone who stays in the UK, because we have extensive systems here that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kent residents is a top priority for the Kent Police Department, and we are working diligently to monitor the behavior of recorded sex offenders to minimize any danger to the public.”
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass the passport check and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his attorney, David Corker, went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in West London, and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested a warrant requiring him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously jailed in the UK for four months for possession of child pornography.
A source in the interior ministry said Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was calm and glad Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master off-stage." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, detached from the focus on interpretation - this is the only way to achieve a relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
The second - a man.
Inseparable, apart from privacy, in those moments far away from the audience - then one can see a confidential gesture, the depth of a fleeting glance or the passionate gesture of hands that are carefree, because they are not going to step onto the stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place within the framework of the Month of Flamenco Photography (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the ever-increasing international importance of flamenco", says the author, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "can be any kind of people, but if you look at the photographs, you will find that these are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and completely captivate the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He has his personality and character inside him.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco giants.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey of portraying flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classical photography.
The use of different stylistic means contradicts the classical basis of the picture and gives it a contemporary spirit, an idea that, according to Bauer himself, also reflects flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which does not cease to surprise and evolve."
What attracts the audience is not the action of the dance, singing or play itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we will meet the most essential, the spirit that manifests itself in the way of perception, being and experiencing, was and is a constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery of El Fotómata.
This selection of almost seventy photographed artists is made up of well-known flamenco figures, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco and will soon receive a book edition that will contain exhibited portraits.
A passion for portraiture led Bauer two years ago to the idea of repeating the idea on "Portraits of a Sports Veteran" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from “Flamenco-people”, the photographer admits that “to photograph people, get to know them and have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just shorter, to enter their lives – this is my passion.
I think that in photography, portrait is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or encounters people, personalities that sometimes he does not even know, or they give him just a few minutes for a photo shoot.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa Admits His Novel Is “Courage”
Set in an environment he doesn’t yet know, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to succeed in his new project – working on a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and has also travelled in the Amazon.
The eternal favorite of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Segovia, admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival that the project that is currently employing him is "boldness" and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
“If I had reason, I wouldn’t do it, but I’m going to do it, and I believe I’ll finish it one day,” he said at a festival of exchange of ideas, ideas and words that saw about a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in the city aqueduct over the course of four days.
The author of the novel "The City and the Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the Word Festival and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Most Popular Writer Award - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had before him a devoted audience, whose hour of time passed like water - the Peruvian with amazing accuracy and a considerable dose of humour remembered how in him from the original "incredible adventure" of "the pleasure of the passionate reader" to "the pleasure of the passionate reader" to "the pleasure of the reader" to "the power of the reader" to "the reader" to live more than I lived.
The Hispanic novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out if and to what extent books can change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just fun, a fleeting experience," Vargas Llosa stressed, saying that "responsibility" and "forces them to "get out of line," and the writer urged them to "get out of line."
Due to climatology, he loses the festival in Pozoblanc - the spear is missing
The spear performance, which concludes the Pozoblanc ceremony, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement by the performers that the surface of the square was not in good condition was confirmed.
That is why the company, together with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Unfavorable weather conditions have plagued the festival for a long time, with two out of three celebrations unable to take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the course of the second planned bullfights.
During them, the formations of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to face the bulls in the arena of Castilblanco.
This was only celebrated on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and the award for dynamic and aesthetically quality performance was carried on his shoulders.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two spears for greetings and one ear, which was brought to him by uncovered seats in the arena rather than by Toreador art.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the bull's arena of Los Llanos unsalted and greasy.
In the second round of hard work without a break, he received harsh criticism from the majority of the audience.
They got out of control in <0xC3><0x81>lava in a van with two thousand kilograms of hashish
Five in ten minutes.
Road control of Ertzaintza in the city district of Armiñón (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Officers stop two people driving in a van and they miss them.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is unstoppable.
According to a report by the Basque Government’s Interior Department, the officers pursued and detained one of the persons driving the van, a 38-year-old man identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transportation Unit were conducting roadside inspections on the N-1 in the areas where it passes the border of the Armiñón district.
They were about to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed instructions, accelerated sharply and escaped.
The officers immediately began chasing the car, until the vehicle stopped at the edge a few kilometers away, at which point both passengers jumped out and fled into the forest.
Ertzaintza eventually caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were transporting, as it turned out during a search of the Iveco Daily van.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with packages of hashish, which were subsequently transported to other police departments for detailed examination and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the license plate is "scratched" and does not agree with the data on the delivery documents, the detainee was therefore also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues his search for the second suspect, who, as mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee, A. A. J., 28 years old, was transferred to the police department for the completion of the relevant formalities before further investigation could be undertaken.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the favorite Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her performing unusual manoeuvres as she tried to drive out of a parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "took a step on the accelerator, drove forward and backwards in a loud roar and tried to get out of the parking space - she ran over her sunglasses several times while reversing."
The witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear a moment after she stopped at a nearby highway and got off the vehicle.
The person also alerted the emergency services because she was “worried for Locklear’s life.”
When police patrol arrived at the scene, they found the actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented" and the officers took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were immediately ruled out, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was evident to the officers at first glance."
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a medical clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian association IU to exercise its powers in the case of Silva
IU chief general and lawmaker for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that the final decision in the case of the former youth and sports councillor in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who stepped down from office last week after being accused of negotiating in favor of his family, will depend on the regional association of the party.
"I'm too federalist for that, it's up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares suggested the party would have to take action against a former member of Seville's city council.
The IU chief, however, insisted that "transparency" was absolutely necessary in the case of an investigation into the illegal conduct committed by Silva: "The IU has always fought for such matters to be as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
'Sangre de mayo', Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the film "Sangre de mayo", inspired by Episodes of the National Past by Benito Pérez Galdós, revives the famous Spanish uprising against the French - it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "draw out the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of society", which he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today along with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the film in front of a large team of artists.
May’s blood, with a metreage of over two and a half hours, will be released this Friday, and in the future there will be more than a four-hour series for Telemadrid TV.
As a great admirer of Galdós's literary work, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled his "childhood dream" by making this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him for the Autonomous Province of Madrid to make a film on the bicentenary of Madrid's 2nd May.
The 15-million budget, fully contributed by the Madrid province, represents for Garcia a "unique opportunity" to create an environment with backdrop and costumes corresponding to the image of "a crumbling Spain that was mistaken in a leader to be fought for - the struggle for independence led to the decline and backwardness of the country under Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the director regrets that he could not count on the financial support he received for the films The Sad Wing (Ala triste) or The Ghosts of Goya - almost twice the amount of May Blood - so he could not shoot some scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horace Valcárcel, with whom he has been working for almost his entire film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empesar) works as usual - on stage together with actors, with whom he usually rehearses before filming and who does not choose a casting, because it seems "humiliating" and also believes that "part of the profession of the director is what to do, to go to the diva, among other things.
Many of the actors he selected for May Blood have appeared before his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, with four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of French Billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflowers, does not represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "the discovery is yet to be made".
For this film, Garcia does not expect any awards.
“At first you think you’re working for what’s next, but then you realize you’re just working for a living, so you’re willing to make one more movie,” Garcia said.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
Seville flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana and moved with her family to London when she was three years old.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dance.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering female emancipation as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and she fought to abolish the corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, enchanted Isabela Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "we are not about telling her life, but about grasping the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So "butterfly dance" evoked me guajira or "snake dance" some tango.
Her dance was sensual, and I was told that my dance also corresponds to this aesthetic,” she said.
The performance is expected to involve two exceptional personalities: Miguel Povida, who will sing Isabele in one performance as in "La Puerta Abierta" (The Open Door), and dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to collaborate with her former student.
"Matilde represents the older Tórtola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me.”
In the performance, he also counts on the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájaro, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of the actor Juanfra Juárez.
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place for her time in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some point, but nowadays no one knows her and even less appreciates her work,” Bayón said.
The performance starts today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "Diary of a newly married man" concludes the triennial
The launch of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a newly married man" at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Triennale of Zenobia and Juan Ramón's" awards.
The "Trial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with the new release of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Ray of Sun", which was opened in May of this year.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government also commissioned eight hundred copies of the "Diary of the Freshly Married" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the world's greatest Andalusian poets.
America Without Paul Newman Doesn't Like It That Much Anymore
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "Without Evil" and under the weight of knowing that Newman has left, reveals her dismal vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
He knew he was seriously ill.
Still, he was a man for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my countries have been made better by him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of film and homeland passed away in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom of a desperate search for reasons to be proud.
When times are rough and people without virtues and only a handful of those worth admiring - you don't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from the Anti-Drugs Foundation, based in honor of his first-born son, who died of an overdose, to his own brand of homemade food and organic foods.
A complete treasure for the country, which cost a lot of effort to get rid of the suicidal food culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was without exaggeration the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
“The fox has set a pretty high standard for all of us,” says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who nowadays has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman – based on honesty and leading a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy, sometimes even possible, in today’s media jungle.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and has since been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
May he be proud in heaven that there is harmony on earth between his daughters and his admirers—that is not very common in America.
“Of all the great roles he embodied, he was the proudest of the roles of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a selfless philanthropist.”
Imperfect races at the Olympics in Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after a failed 2012 it may be 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we're going to drive yesterday's race, I say no!
It was spoken of as the perfect race, and in my judgment it was the worst race I had ever been to.
Such a bunch of nonsense that immediately, if it came to the evaluation and I was the examiner, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one by one.
Nonsense begins with picking up a race number, for which one has to leave early.
That doesn’t seem bad to me, but when a person goes there, let them give him everything (including the chip, which is supposed to prevent overcrowding of the track).
Oh, no, no, no.
Here one had to first pick up the number (first nonsense, go there just for that) and (after the proper queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a size S T-shirt (second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy only small T-shirts, because it is less fabric and they are cheaper?
Well, those are small things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early for the chip and the queue for it took over 15 minutes, the backpack had to be handed over there.
Over 35 minutes of waiting time, which is something incomprehensible at the race, where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as you might expect, the race started and we haven’t put our backpacks down yet, and when we did, it was much worse with the pickup.
In addition, the wait prolonged the rain by 40 minutes, which led to a general uprising and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some, like me, will not see the right time in evaluating the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I assume, did not record the start time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this one wouldn’t have occurred to me.
So I think we'll just have to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT New Technologies Conference, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in a new AI-like image recognition and human interaction system – not very intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks like calling a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move around the company’s campus) and perceiving what he hears in a conversation.
With a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this “receptionist” can see how many people are in the room, who they are — even remember what they’re wearing — and listen to and understand the keywords of their conversations.
It can also sort attendees by conversation groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records the third person and understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to him and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is going to see someone, and he tells her that he will look after her in a moment.
All this without the blue screen of death.
Fascinating.
This is, of course, the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured out that if computers had only the necessities, without the burden of commercial waste, they would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discovery like thunder, considering that Microsoft version from version adds new features to Windows and more "extra".
A change of direction would be a meritorious act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its relevance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I became one of those who leaned towards the theory that it was Google’s first step towards competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
An operating system will always be necessary, as it is the necessary layer for understanding between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right. I'm sorry.
It never goes away, but one must think of the “death” of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, conversely, more attention to the Internet browser.
Your computer turns on to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around windows.
What is the purpose of half of the applications that accompanies the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here is a small example.
I took this photo in a Microsoft employee restroom in Redmond earlier this month.
There was a poster on the vending machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come in early 2009, but at the end, that is, let's not count until 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one shone in Edward Zwick's "Bloody Diamond", as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather", and he is part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to get into the list of his life roles, we can dive into the image of a typical musculous man with a pointed moustache who lifts weights in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton men's undershirt, fitting and sleeveless.
English speakers call it 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all others.
Firstly, because of its stunning name - although it is popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, as the legend tells, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out over other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost imperceptible) Belgian flag, which models of the most iconic vests have as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not specialize only in tank tops.
It also produces college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, children's clothes, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
It's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother. I don't care who's going to be a father."
The enormous resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though a small character, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new role in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, it means so much more than just letting some pretty, famous girl lend her name.
In Paris, she participated in a promotional event organized by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
She is warm and timid and will get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that Sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango for this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and a dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentine.
It was a difficult but at the same time exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for the Mango company, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the 1950s and 1960s, and we drew a lot of inspiration from them.
I also like to wander around the city and watch women walking around dressed, combining and layering their clothes, I do this very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but after all, everything is interconnected and has many connections.
For example, I liked clothes from a young age, I still wanted to go to my grandmother’s house, go through my aunt’s closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to look after how I was dressed.
You know, we dancers rely on the way we're dressed to feel good in our lessons and rehearsals when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you really penetrate the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
Recently, you were 30, did you have a crisis?
No, no, no.
I'm feeling better than ever, I'm having fun in my 30s.
I find that a woman is already done, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
I do what I want, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don’t want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will make my child feel happy and I will raise him with great love.
As far as the film is concerned, there are several premieres of the films you made last year.
That’s right, I’m looking forward to it coming to the movies.
I come from the theatrical world, so I am very impatient and restless, I want everything now, and of course it is not possible.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última montaña" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the parade pier with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to step on the pier as a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I’ve known for a long time, and she invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her organization, “Women for a Better Life,” and the clothes we were showing—I also selected two models from our Mango collection—were auctioned off, and the proceeds were donated to this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
There are a lot of things being said about her, and I can tell you that many of them are not true, since I know her.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good stuff he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to do a stand, I'll do it too.
I will do what is necessary for the benefit of the women of the third world.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in the blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in his car that prevents him from starting the car drunk or if he does not breathe.
The proposal came to light in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its goal is to return the driver behind the wheel, therefore, drivers will also have to take a course of traffic re-education.
In addition to the National Transportation Safety Authority, the General Directorate of Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of motorists charged with drunk driving more than once get back behind the wheel in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe first or if the alcohol level is higher than the allowed concentration.
Its price exceeds 1,000 euros and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device had a 65% reduction in offences during the first year since its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with this behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its introduction, since legislation can be implemented in the usual way, however, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available in any sales version on the Spanish market, although it has already been tested in some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles.
Tomorrow, Congress will vote on a proposal by the PSOE (Spanish Workers’ Socialist Party) recommending the installation of this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and no "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 5.40 p.m., as scheduled, a Spanish Air Force plane landed at the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico D.F., in which the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun was just setting, but its rays had so far forced them to cover their eyes so that they could see the successor pair coming out of the plane.
Under the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, well, that's great, she's not gonna be able to get to the airport at that time to pick up people... she's from here or whatever...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
However, the Mexican press knows well who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the airport hangar close to the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honorary salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit, and the princess, very modestly dressed and with unshaven hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently she was reported to be in danger of a thunderstorm in D.F.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and casually pose for them.
At the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city, a chatty Mexican TV reporter is waiting for them.
The Best Subsidized Fashion Award
There is probably no more suitable place in the world to announce a fashion award than Paris, and there is probably no more excellent designer and bonvivana than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow an international presentation of new talents in the field of fashion.
The prize is subsidized by the amount of 300,000 euros.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, winner of the first year, looked at her designs in the Manga window on the 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris yesterday and almost cried with emotion.
Sure, it is the second largest store of this company in Europe and has just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest is in London.
Many events, along with a desire to thank designer Valentino for taking over the presidency of the competition jury, caused us to have a sumptuous dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
Mango's ceremonially decorated chair-table looked even more marvellous besides the finest of Chagall's works.
Nati, who was heartbroken by the grief of her brother's recent death, dressed in this brand and breath-taking ELAH jewellery, and hung in her son Luis, a nearly two-metre-high elegance, accompanied Valentina to the head of the table at a dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of the Mango Company, was welcomed and, as a true gentleman, was left without a jacket with Baron Rothschild, for both of them had been offered to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - hand-designed - pants and shirt and for dinner dressed in long black sexy dresses, was moved by a night walk at the Opera accompanied by Goya Toled, showed us the ballroom for ballet rehearsals and, remembering the other times, grabbed one of those.
Inés Sastre did not delay her tour of the adjacent buildings of the palace, but before leaving she showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we could enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and had asked in advance that no fragrances be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh la la, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about the chaotic and frenzied everyday life.
And to make matters worse, they are all summarized in one book that will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30th.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in the rushed rhythm that present life brings.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of detachment from the world of work.
No, that number is no bigger and no less than 1001.
Apart from yogi positions, classic massages and “spa” therapy, Susannah Marriott has put together a whole “menu” of options in the pages of her book, tailored to each individual’s taste and time possibilities.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 Ways to Relax" and thanks to the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone believes that it is not possible to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" denies this view.
In addition, it offers additional procedures to be in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you don’t have the adrenaline in your veins to rebalance your body, and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Talking from sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may scare you, but in reality it is meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure many of you have been told that he spoke in his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single reason for her arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night rage, enuresis nocturna or sleepwalking, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or irritable situations.
In any case, this is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or quite the opposite (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where he manifests himself with great force, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if he has any problem that causes him great anxiety, and in this way he manifests himself.
We have said that this is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to bed.
So find quiet games and avoid spooky or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who can work to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques to help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When somnilokvie appears, try to stay calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and that he will not remember anything from what happened the next day.
Useful Advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and therefore he rests.
Keep in mind that if you think that you are suffering a lot several times in a row, it would be wise to seek advice or find out what is causing such anxiety in your child.
If it is to understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to question him and extract information from him.
It will be useless, because when he sleeps, he is not conscious in order to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming about, and therefore why he is saying it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell your child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not for fun.
That causes a lot of anxiety.
Don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory again after a long period of leanness.
Without playing a particularly big match, the yellow-blacks created more chances and managed to transform one of them victoriously.
The game did not have too fast pace during this clash, in which the attackers had difficulty advancing.
After the captain's first attempt to host Kauffmann, who had missed the coupling by a hair, Illhaeusern began to have a slight upper hand, and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain by long leg, or even Diebold gradually came to irritate Dannemarie's defense.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the field, leaving only the agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to the two chances of Dannemarie with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after the opening score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well positioned for processing the ball bounced after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
The goalkeeper of Illhaeusernu did not long enjoy the joy, but after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room, leaving his teammates weak.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to make the most of it, and the eleven from Illhaeusern, who had withdrawn only a little to "condense" the defense, caused no more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the beam after a great confusion.
Sarkozy goes to meet angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
To face a demonstration of the strength of fishermen who severely disrupted access to several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French president decided to head to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their officials.
The latter promised to be received "in a constructive spirit" and hoped to "come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to take action against the sharp rise in oil prices, which reached a peak of an average of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them the solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure terms of employment and pay for seafarers."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with intransigence.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out Operation Snail (slow-moving vehicle operation) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10km of congestion.
The recreational harbour of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not interrupted.
A filter dam was set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination on Monday, when they burned tires and pallets at Brest and Lorient just before dawn, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where trawlers remained at the port, or Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the traffic of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before deciding to act on their own.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is due to decide on Tuesday how to proceed with its journey and its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Fisheries Department, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let anything go" and "they do not want to come to Paris", for example, said Liliane Cariou, chairwoman of the fisheries department in Lorient.
Occupational fishermen who do not pay the oil tax currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but believe that the threshold of profitability of the ship is reached only when the oil is below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman
Butch Cassidy and Kid died of cancer at the age of 83 at his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and also Sam Mendes paid homage to film legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying on the delivery of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession looming over the world economy.
The world’s fourth aircraft designer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 deliveries with 215 units delivered, its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer has a lot of promise from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers over an eight-year period.
AIG is considering transferring 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, who has been overrun by U.S. monetary authorities, is considering transferring more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it was given as a down payment, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
AIG is poised to investigate the sale of most of its non-life insurance activities internationally and retirement activities in the United States, the daily said, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to examine possible referrals.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statements from AIG.
Assets that AIG intends to dispose of include its subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision on these referrals has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must urgently raise cash in order to repay the $85 billion loan the Federal Reserve provided to it, at the risk of being confiscated by the U.S. authorities of 80% of its capital, thereby diluting the current shareholder to the appropriate ratio.
Paris. Analysis of the historical meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to bail out banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
The largest point decline in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
The Nasdaq, with its dominant technology component, lost 199.61 points after the closing of trading data and stabilized at 1,983.73, and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Depressed from the start of the session, Wall Street literally collapsed after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the plan to bail out banks, a plan that was supposed to allow some stability to be found again in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, representatives refused to provide Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent by the market to see that Congress is unable to adopt a certain plan,” Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days would come "too late".
“If this project is truly doomed to collapse, the baton will be immediately handed over to the Fed and other central banks to spark the crisis, which would further solidify credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, Global Insight’s chief economist.
And stressing the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States, "every new day brings the collapse of one financial institution".
After Friday’s bankruptcy, Washington Mutual organized the purchase of Wachovia Bank’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn and demanded urgent interventions in favor of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are grappling "not just with the US crisis, but with the global crisis," the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
Cash receipt revenue for 10 years fell to 3.632% from 3.827% on Friday evening, revenue for 30 years to 4.161 % from 4.357 % the previous day.
Obama wins first TV duel by points
Friday's first debate between the two candidates in the White House was followed by a second debate to find out which of the two men, John McCain and Barack Obama, won.
The campaign’s Republicans and Democrats were not surprised when both declared their victory in a TV duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, however decent, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat is the winner of the duel.
Among the undecided voters who matter, Obama is the winner for 39% of those polled, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his co-candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She's talented," Clinton said at the weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his undeniable foreign-policy experience, while stressing his opponent’s “naivety” on issues that formed the core of the first clash.
“It seems that Senator Obama did not understand that...” was the repeated accusation.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has enough experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
In such an offensive spirit, Republican TV spots have been aired since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represents the future.
He did not lose his head and proved to be brief and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions and restore the United States’ reputation in the world.
“McCain still didn’t understand while Obama did,” the Democratic spot said on the weekend, accusing the Republican of not taking enough into account the impact of the crisis on the “common American.”
“During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing to say about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered at an election rally in North Carolina.
He hasn't even uttered words like "middle class" or "workers." Financial decay clearly favours Obama, whom Americans consider more capable of saving the economy on the brink of the abyss.
“Next week could be a decisive turnaround,” said influential Democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “economic foresight” to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic nominee, the current disaster is “the final verdict of an eight-year-old bad economic policy as pursued by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the unexpected leaps of Wall Street, he should be able to cut taxes for 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that realizing the country’s eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) bailout plan passed by Congress last night, which is highly unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice that there were elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to deny the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closing of polling stations in Minsk’s main square to protest the irregularity of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, resignation".
Some admit that they didn’t even go to the polls: “What’s the point if they do whatever they want with my voice anyway,” says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, including a visa ban on 40 Belarusian heads of state and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections are considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count," Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse grouping of 12 parties, said in a statement.
"It's a cosmetic change," Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leader of the pro-European movement, stresses, "because it's important who counts the votes, and here it's the executive branch.
If any opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be by being appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament could mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and bills."
Therefore, the opposition feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because "it is necessary to start a dialogue with the European Union.
If our economy, which is deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which monitored the elections, will not declare the elections valid.
He stresses that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What about you, did you notice that there was an election?" asks social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are most compliant with the regime."
The silence of the night had once again reached the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on the success.
Interview - Blood That Is Sure Again
Hema-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice as Hema-Québec has become one of the most reliable and efficient blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained the confidence of the public, which was seriously shaken after the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the national blood reserve administered by the Transfusion Department of the Canadian Red Cross was contaminated with the Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the wave of public unrest, the Canadian Government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at explaining the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and formulating recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever delayed submitting the report, some provinces put in place a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, Gélinea’s committee held this role.
Following Gélineau's and Krever's reports, two contractors were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to administer Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Company for the supply of all provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, only 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," Dr. Décary recalls.
"The situation was depressing.
Through continuous efforts to increase the safety of blood products and continuous work in this area, we have regained public confidence over the next years," he says, adding proudly that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population already trusted Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
"At that time, we saw many cases in Europe of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease," says a woman who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread through the blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, according to which, if we do not know it and if a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, is at stake, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, exclusionary measures should be taken.
Thus, in April 1999, we rejected blood from people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease is transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that adhering to the precautionary principle made sense."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting the HIV virus appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which allow to detect the presence of the virus itself in donor blood, and not the presence of antibodies on which the tests were based previously.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when our techniques can detect the first viruses in the blood, explains the specialist.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have substantially reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it and without being able to figure it out.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of acquiring AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood.
In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through the blood product to occur.
I believe that today we can receive or prescribe the blood transfusion necessary for healing in complete peace," said the head of the management of Hema-Quebec.
“The challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogens may appear in the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by insect bites.
We must always be cautious,” Dr. Décary continues, stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also count on a sufficient supply.
“Needs are growing as the population ages.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecers eligible for donation.”
Every healthy person is at least 18 years old, meeting the eligibility criteria, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where mud fever is rampant, they are excluded for one year.
“With this 3%, we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
Members of the donor network, however, need to be supplemented in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
However, it is difficult to persuade people to donate blood, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
“Life is so unbridled today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being deposited at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, abounds in blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample into the bank, and we expect to collect over a thousand per year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants," says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some moms are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Héma-Québec does not have enough funds to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
Impact Montreal qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division Elimination Series yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive quarter-final match of the total number of goals, thanks to a 3:1 win (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over Sounders from Seattle.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the two-sided goalless first half, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino hanged the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who managed to deal with Matt Jordan in favor of Sounders.
Recall that on Friday, during the first of two games of the quarterfinals, Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in the suburbs of Seattle.
Impact will compete in the semifinals against the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder equalized the home game deficit 3:1 and eventually won 4:3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semi-final round with a total of 5:4 goals.
Impact is set to clash with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will not be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attacking trio of Canadiens is ready to start the season.
A unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekance and Andrej Kosticin last night at the Centre Bell encouraged the attack to the victory of Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the clash, scored a goal, Plekanec scored two assists, and Kovalev collected one pass in this fourth victory of the three-colored of the six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during the separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian said.
"I need one more game to feel good."
"He tried to handle too much in the first quarter," said Guy Carbonneau.
“I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a good applause.”
Charest bets on the north
The prime minister does not rule out calling early elections by the end of the year.
Immediately after the Liberal Party (Parti liberal) convention, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today’s midterm elections.
"To push the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually engaging way at the conclusion of the Quebec Liberal Party Congress in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind him in a kind of pictorial mill.
On three giant canvases, a loop was running with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the perspective of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous funds, as in the pre-election period.
At a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out snap elections in the fall, although he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
The “North Plan” forms the fourth dimension of the “vision” that the prime minister intends for Quebec, a vision of a “new economic space” that includes a labor agreement with France, a Canada-Europe agreement, and agreements with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has often mentioned in his statements lately, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is a "jewel with enormous potential", but did not specify a date, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At the most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further developed: in particular hydropower, forests, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory twice the size of France is here," "is in Québec.
And it’s not just in our country, it’s in our country,” he said, as if to show that he was invoking a national founding myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, highlighted by the Prime Minister: the pursuit of gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after paused theatrically to look at the huge map behind his back.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes the part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister said at a press conference.
"This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all previous governments.
There is one boundary line on which there has been no convention for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will take that position again in the name of the government.”
“In the context of climate change, we also need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, referring to the North-West transition, which will open year-round as a result of melting glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that seizing territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already started negotiations with about thirty communities.
The work was launched by an inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be laid out".
Moreover, the development of the North should be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “cooperatively designed, structured and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a continuation of the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our mindset to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was, after all, one of the ever-shocked topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a big cocktail celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s ascension to the party’s leadership.
One of the resolutions proposed to rename the Beauharnois headquarters to the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who led the Quiet Revolution and nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future,” Charest said.
At a press conference, he appealed to another authority, this time a conservative one, namely John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, which premiered from 1957 to 1963.
When the turn came for the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam, Charest stressed that its launch is planned for 2012.
"I'm only saying this between us, but I plan to be there," he told his membership base, sparking applause.
The same Prime Minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and undoubtedly in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling elections in the fall of this year, which the law allows him.
However, he stressed that his program is loaded, especially the missions of the Federal Council in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend congress provided the Liberal leader with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular some "efforts to amend the constitution" that went very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) demands in particular recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint a part of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council who would have veto power in the case of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the North Plan was accepted skeptically in its main features.
The head of PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois re-drafted the North Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced the implementation of this policy.
Had she adhered to it, "we would have gone on today," Marois noted alongside her candidate at the Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we wish it weren't just theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from his holidays today.
Letters - Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of “justice” (ironically) in Harper’s cabinet, who dared to say last summer about Louise Arbour that he was “a disgrace” to Canada.
To humiliate a woman who has waged a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about the prime minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that is the only one of all the Western countries involved that has not returned to its homeland a national imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that, at the time of the acts he was accused of taking place, Omar Khadr was a young adolescent.
The only government that, despite Canada’s signature of the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and in particular the Canadian Bar Association are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can await a fair trial in Canada.
The same government turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little that this young man is now psychologically destroyed, undoubtedly permanently, after so many years of torture.
We are not aware of this, but we are witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our “democracy,” the words that Harper is so fond of and that from his mouth sound so empty.
The time has come when there is no longer any morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to mistreat him, to imprison him at the will of the head of the already minority government (as will be the case after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in the party that proclaims Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and prestige of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world’s largest gold producer has launched a lawsuit against three authors and a poor little publishing house for insults to honour, with the aim of sparking “transparent public debate” and demanding six million.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truthfulness, especially in the case of prosecutions for offense to honor, but the law.
It is not surprising that Garver completely ignores this crucial distinction.
Or is the best way for Barrick Gold to lead a public debate is to bankrupt anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a very uneven battle against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of a mining company.
The tactic in these unbalanced battles, after all, often consists in ruining defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will shut the mouth of the opposing party and, moreover, frighten anyone who dares to commit to this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view of the matter to the public.
Contrary to what is happening in the few countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate is normally about exchanging ideas and not about stick wounds.
Thus, mining companies were not enough to open their books, their documentation, and establish a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and the funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the matter.
However, Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and swiftly rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand "public debate" while contemptuously disregarding the views of the same public?
In the vice-president's world, this word seems to refer only to well-paid lawyers, and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow concept of the term.
In a democracy, people have the right to speak up.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because they reject the brutal ways of the mining society.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in what many perceive as a prosecution, in which the defendant is to be silenced (as part of its prosecution of the "public debate" Barrick, incidentally, has just filed an official call for the authors of Noir Canada to use this term, to re-announce the authors of the...
Aside from Garver’s surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university’s freedom to research and seek the truth that is essential to any democratic society.
In general, he denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss topics that the rich companies of this world do not like without being subjected to repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted public and transparent debate, it could have created it if it had followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He's entitled to an answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to limit this type of unjustified prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operations: Democrats and Republicans get along
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use $700 billion to curb the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of deposited public money, new measures to capture the number of houses seized due to non-repayment, as well as the right to monitor the level of wages paid to managers of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican representative at the negotiating table, announced this good news yesterday minutes after midnight, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said in a statement.
“Everything has been done to keep the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the Wall Street crisis,” he said.
“This is a crucial point: if we don’t do this, the trauma, the chaos, and the disruption to the everyday lives of Americans will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, negotiations have run to maximum speed for fear of the effect that another failure would have on investors’ moods.
The time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both US presidential candidates were invited to negotiate later, and both were more in favour of an agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama credited the amendment to the agreement with some measures, in particular those aimed at allowing homeowners to keep their homes, and measures on the wages of managers of state-rescued companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on television.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The rough features I’ve read [show] that this is something we’re all going to have to digest and make it possible to move forward.
The choice of inaction is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The goal of the $700 billion plan is to buy up dubious receivables and risky and non-sellable assets of U.S. financial institutions with taxpayers’ money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis unleashed by the bursting of the real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
The failure of the first draft of the agreement last week is the responsibility of Republican MPs.
Since the Democrats agreed that some of the "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty would be guaranteed by the government, but not bought, there has been a belief that the impasse has been averted.
In an effort to bring opposing views in Congress closer together, a provision was added to stipulate that the government would be able to introduce new fees to help it reclaim its deposit if it had to assume losses for five years as a result of the program.
The new plan envisages a deposit of the first amount of 250 billion, to which it will be possible to add another 100 billion, if the president deems it necessary.
A further $350 billion is to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire shares in the rescued companies, which will pay him dividends in case of profit and which he will be able to sell again when everything is over.
The federal government will be able to delay the procedures for the seizure of property related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits on the amount of remuneration and compensation paid to executives of the affected companies.
The drafters of the plan would like to submit it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain that their plan will be green.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against this project in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
"It's very clear that Washington can't hear you," Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But making money from taxpayers is not the solution.”
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen nicknamed the "committee of skeptics", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
Four hundred distinguished professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: “We ask Congress not to rush too much and carefully examine which path to take.”
At the same time, it was once again confirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
At the end of the emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which is on the verge of collapsing since it lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion ($2.9 billion) as a result of the risky loan crisis on the purchase of real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of Europe’s top 20 banks and top 10 insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
“In return, we get the right to vote and influence in the bank.
And that’s what savings and households can appreciate in today’s uncertain times.”
On the other side of the English Channel, the British government seems to have begun nationalising another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing Bradford and Bringley loans, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) were loans for the purchase of real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy branches and accounts of clients of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalised by the British government since the financial crisis began.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Socially Engaged Icon
His beauty with azure eyes had long been his trump card, according to other weaknesses.
Has this American actor with a charming smile escaped from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and relentless talent that he possessed also distanced him from the power category that breeds true stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 at his Connecticut ranch from lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, to whom he resembled and who had long been a rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the dissolution of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful babies.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was Hungarian.
From these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
No exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because the whole country was in love with a self-made man, a warrior wounded in battle in the Pacific War who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s, then attended New York's Actor's Studio and triumphed in theater, television, and soon film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who came second at the 1979 Le Mans 24 Hours and a sex symbol, despite forming an exemplary pair with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also go the shadowy places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the noise of his own show-business, which will forever remain to some extent mysterious.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s departure this weekend has made film lovers dizzy as his big roles compete on the black screen of memories.
After him, he parades more than half a century of the constantly changing American Seventh Art.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Roof, a 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams.
From a less distant past (1990), we remember his sensitive Mr. Bridge, anxious at an advanced age by a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, the abusive, violent, memorable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, taken after his death, which in 1956 made Newman a real acquaintance.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen’s amazing The Hustler (1961), he plays the same character in Martin Scorsese’s The Color of Money, earning him the only Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
This face wandering for ages, it was him.
There he is again.
In his career, different epochs compete with each other.
Young people know him mainly because of the iconic Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977) in the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
He then ended his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends who left the craft relatively soon, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its gilding, pomp, and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered it "a lively challenge to underplaying", judging that in his performances he pushed too much on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles came as if on a tray, the profession was not always so gentle.
However, he played the first lovers less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, loopholes and despairers, whose decay and rebellions were reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known aspects of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, provides a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, he dedicated the film Harry and Son to his son Scott, whom he lost to an overdose, a work full of shame and sadness.
In a flurry of tributes to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former fellow fighter Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly declared, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of life, these are the main qualities of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, there is also a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opponent of Hollywood’s decline.
We used to see his image on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, which may have seemed rather tasteless, although it was a gag at first.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Hard Childhood.
So, instead of letting himself be swayed by fame, Newman engaged in society until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these words: “Always and until the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here.”
And it was an honor to be able to follow the life of such a bright-sighted and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, an exemplary citizen.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, on October 8, the trial will begin in the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates.
The politician and his associates are accused, among other crimes, including forgery of documents, of fraud committed by a long-term and systematic criminal organization, as a result of which exceptionally significant damage was caused.
According to the prosecutor’s office, they used the money raised in public tenders for their own purposes and often used fictitious invoices to prove the fulfilment of their tasks.
The money from the state and local governments - a total of about 65 million forints - went partly to the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method also communicated by the investigating authority was that the money raised in the tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration and never met the obligations assumed by the association.
According to the prosecution, a large part of the invoices were false.
The printouts for these invoices came from the Józsefváros market, the round stamps were made in Kiskunhalas.
The names of the companies on which the production of invoices is to take place were decided, among other things, on the roundabout along the northern bank of the Balaton, which was sent by István Lados János Zuschlag.
According to his testimony, he was first named to look at pensions and restaurants.
In them, he asked for bills for his consumption, according to the model of which invoices submitted in the framework of public tenders issued by, among others, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively, the Municipality of the capital were produced.
Most of the invoices were issued by István Lados with his partner András <0xC5><0x90>rim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "study trip," Lados looked at a cellar.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this catering establishment provided catering for a group of ninety members of the Biztos Pont association.
However, according to the head of the company, so many people would not fit into this facility at once.
Similarly, an invoice issued in the summer of 2002 by the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was fraught with formal and content errors.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet one hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, the form-fillers with a rich imagination exaggerated this even when they listed on the documents a company dedicated to the same hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounts, according to the information provided to the public prosecutor's office, documents under the names Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá did not even appear.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the head of the company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
In addition to the formalities, the fact that they accommodated 100 people according to the invoice did not agree, because they have only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, catering was also indicated on the invoice, and their restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The zealous invoicing manufacturers were also not convinced that the Budapest travel agency in question only organizes foreign trips, and the invoice with cash payment, which also did not coincide with the invoicing practice of the company, foolishly stated as a service of intermediation of travel in Hungary.
Moreover, as it emerged during the investigation, VAT was also mentioned in the document, although the organization of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
Four documents issued to Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree, among other things, to the amount of VAT. The company’s activities are not covered by the 25% VAT, but by the 15% VAT, in addition, the hotel’s employees issued only printed invoices, but the invoice was made by hand.
In addition, the "publishers" spoiled the invoice, for example, by stating to one company, as it turned out through the investigation of the public prosecutor's office, as an activity carried out by road transport of goods, which the company originally based on investment advice did not perform.
The fact that the invoices issued by the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and the associations of XXI Szazadi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false was also revealed due to formal deviations - inconsistent invoice format and false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not even notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal Városért association was eating there, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he would issue the paper.
Invoices were issued consciously.
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew they had to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation issued accounts for about four million forints to the Harmadik Évezrédért Foundation at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták organization.
According to the indictment, one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, persuaded the head of Collab s.r.o. to issue a fictitious invoice.
Biogate s. r. o., currently in liquidation, also cooperated with Zuschlag and his associates and in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation and the Atlasz and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> associations with invoices worth about five million forints, beyond which there was no real economic activity.
Neither does the money flow, because the invoices were later cancelled, which organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing firms included those that had ties to the defendants.
Thus, for example, Ivan Kubatov was the deputy representative of the Ukrainian company Delta Trió s.r.o., dealing with fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the information found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s. r. o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was to hand over documents related to the company in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to Atlasz, Hoppá and the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért foundations and accepted their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s. were founded by Romanian masons.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies benefited him, because at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to Atlasz and Y-Generáció associated with Zuschlaga.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaextrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor’s office concluded that Kubatov had recovered 10 percent of the amounts indicated on the invoices and VAT.
In order to issue fictitious invoices, this time for the tender for Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted proposals to the public tender of the Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party.
They received 500,000 forints each, but did not spend the sums on the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order not to reveal this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found during a search at <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei’s office at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants will probably describe the course of production of invoices, as they have already done at the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant János Zuschlag himself decides to reveal everything.
His statement so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised to explain everything in detail several times, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the Socialists have made a deal with him and Zusi will take it upon himself.
He could have been offended, for his requests for a softening of the conditions of his detention, namely, his placement under house arrest, had not been heard until now.
While perpetrators of economic crimes who have done much greater damages that have not yet been paid can walk freely or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
The Psychology of Trumping: Why Do We Spend More Money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overvalue goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been revealed by researchers in the field of neuroscience and economics at New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to lag behind in an eBay auction competition, so they would rather pay too high a price.
Using an experimental auction, the research attempted to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in the auction, while using the method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were studied active areas of the brain of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction, an important element of which is to beat the other side, a whole located under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to function intensively during the loss.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region plays a role in the “self-reward” mechanism of the nervous system.
According to the researchers, the screwing of the price can therefore be explained by an attempt to avoid a sharp reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, members of the research team from among economists conducted a cross-sectional financial investigation.
At the same time, three groups bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, members of the next group were promised that if they left the game victorious, they would receive another $ 15 as a reward.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, that one was highlighted winning and the other was highlighted losing.
However, members of the group playing "against losing" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"These results cannot be inferred from any pre-existing economic theory.
So far, they have explained the phenomena observed in auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
It wasn’t until neurological imaging methods helped us resolve the discrepancy between the two theories that we now came to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York’s School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason for this is that patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a collective name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, characterized by inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the causes of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the causative agents of the disease, spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E in the digestive tract (for example, infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
In any case, travelers should protect themselves by vaccination against the A and B viruses, there is no vaccine against the C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of an infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, nausea.
After that, jaundice forms on the skin and whites of the eyes, lightening stools and darkening urine. Treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide die from a more serious form of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people is treated with medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, the causative agent of the disease destroys the liver cells insidiously, so the first symptoms appear in many cases only in 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, carrying out regular depistage is very important.
In three groups, the disease is much more common than the average: among people who received blood transfusions before 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can be proven by routine laboratory tests, a person should contact his GP if he notices any symptoms of unknown origin.
With early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, preventing infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized worldwide by the organizations representing the sick in 2004.
Its purpose is to draw attention to chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Who believes in God doesn’t hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic that could ease the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how in man the belief in the god of perception of pain affects, reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and an equal number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate a large part of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of studying the human brain in detail, it turned out that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first of a series of researches, which are attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
Precisely the test was carried out by attaching a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the subject, which produced electric shocks.
Researchers asked participants to observe two paintings: the 17th-century Virgin Mary of Sassoferrato and Leonardo da Vinci’s Lady of the Cross, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would evoke a certain state of piety in the faithful, while they chose da Vinci's painting because it is not very different from the first and gives a soothing impression.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts, while separately watching an image with a religious or general theme.
Catholics said they felt “safe” when looking at the Virgin Mary, as if they had been “cared for” and “peace filled them.”
They said they felt 12 percent less pain when watching a painting with a religious theme than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any highly impressive image even in atheists, only to find the right photo.
"We would have to find a picture that they would perceive very positively, from the position of a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases will change, our personality,” Wright said.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on regulating the pain of believers if they were shown some Madonna by Leonardo or a painter of similar caliber.
Would looking at a quality Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You are what you share of yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can declare that people can find it at least as well in their pockets as in the sky above their heads; they know where they have been on vacation, what professional examinations they go to and what they are interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s CEOs, this is still not enough.
However, as for the skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwellian dark vision, the very essence of the Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary to enable the founders of Google to stick to their original intention, which was: “Let’s organize all the information in the world!”
According to a Google spokesperson, the company, even after ten years of world-class work, is only at the beginning to be able to work with all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions like “what should I do tomorrow?” or “what kind of work would be good for me?” – but software won’t be able to answer such seemingly simple questions until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users are well aware that the search words are accurately captured during the search, as well as the IP address from which they were searched and to which pages they moved after the search.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, for example, users can keep a history of their surfing, they can look back at what they were looking for and what they clicked on, thanks to which in the long run, findings are generated much more directly tailored to them - the same logic will be used for the service Recommendations, through which the system will be based on the previously mentioned and saved preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I do? – asks users who are afraid when looking at Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is more frightening, the counter-reaction does not evoke guilt awareness in Internet users, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases they can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases the personality rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most well-known recent example was probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community sites established through it.
However, internet users who are concerned about personality rights could still rest in May when the company, along with the electronic rights organization EFF, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI in the future by any article of the constitution.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully won nearly 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, which it has gained with reference to the strengthening of the Children’s Protection Act passed years ago, yet it has failed to get individual user search lists, or complete lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The view of Google is thus quite contradictory: it is flogged by those who are afraid of providing their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be harmed by starting to use Google’s services, and they oppose it with a revolt that belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its wild branch, gathering enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, see in him a new generation of big companies, a “corporation that’s booming now”, unlike its rival Microsoft, which is considered to be the conqueror of the world because of Windows, although they both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not want them to pay for their applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs appears to be much more accessible, youthful, "cooler" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which was brought with it by one of the most leaning keywords of recent years: the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about nothing but cooperation, about intentionally leaving traces behind and using the communication channels we have at our disposal, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can have a profile on several community pages from Facebook to Xang, which he can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm app, recording his music, then he can connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm.
While we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which she lights up: a girlfriend in the morning looking at a flood of photos of mutual friends easily finds out with whom her joking friend spent the evening, or the company can fire his employee just because on his blog expresses his honest opinion about the top management completely.
One who lives an online life consists of what he shows, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least avoid Google’s monopoly, has the option (starting with Scroogle, which uses Google’s search engine, but does not intentionally leave a trace).
For example, a large number of people do not intentionally register on community sites so that they cannot be found. Google's online applications from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and that do not build the best possible profile of us.
Public opinion is not secretly expecting Google to show its teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space is jeopardizing ad agency investments and services being rolled out at an ever-accelerating pace are seriously making life more difficult for not only Microsoft but also numerous other software designers.
Critical observers, however, also find counterpoints to the regime appearing to be disturbing: the top management, for example, completely rejected the protests of employees after raising the fee for the company's kindergarten to twice, at any time the daily meals of employees were too expensive, according to the management of the company, but all this is lost in the sense of a deal that their government has lost the favor in 2006.
One of the internal rules of the company is that it never advertises new medical services in advance, only when they can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years can shake the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project aimed at scanning and archiving his books and magazines can take on such problems with the American system, the company can take on such a large profile with its own, that the company will soon have to deal with it.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material for future generations of science fiction writers, Cory Doctorow’s famous novel “Scroogled” describes, with Orwellian reminiscences, a future in which one can frighteningly well approach a person only with the help of Google data.
Two teenagers helped double-assassin remove traces from <0xC3><0x93>zd
Two young people were questioned by police in the case of a double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zd, according to reasonable suspicion, helped to remove traces of this crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County High Police Directorate said on Tuesday.
Persons have confessed to the activity of which they were suspected and are currently accused of facilitating a criminal offence.
The two teenagers, according to MTI, are being prosecuted at large.
Facilitation of a crime is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder in <0xC3><0x96>zdu, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of committing a pre-planned multiple murders for self-interest.
During the investigation, it emerged that the 23-year-old man owed the 53-year-old man a larger sum.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt, so he lured his creditor last Wednesday to an establishment in <0xC3><0x93>zd, where he killed first a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was preparing for the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - was offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side, despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is due to the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60% of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 writes, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far submitted bids.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all the bidders, and did not rule out that this could lead to the liquidation of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent share, followed by <0xC4><0x8C>eská spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European newspapers are already reminiscent of "September 11th".
We can thank the US President for the global financial disaster, La Repubblica accuses. The President has not even been able to set up his own party in support of that hasty bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded billionaire investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, the world economy has been brought to the brink of collapse by the lack of political leadership there.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is steadily growing, and the whole world will eventually pay for it.
While the Bush plan was not perfect, after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to resolve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - at a time when one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, notes the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a lifeline at struggling monetary institutions, and taxpayers can save them from collapse.
However, if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither money nor further improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move beyond their national egoism and unite control over fragmented financial markets.
More than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion was received by the posting monetary institutions on Monday alone, Der Standard said, adding that fears that European taxpayers, like Americans, would have to dig deeper into their pockets to resolve the crisis are increasingly real.
The European Union has not yet dealt seriously with the crisis, which is rolling like a tsunami on the old continent.
"Rescuers" do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros at once, but it would be good if they determined firmly in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of a bumblebee
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitating the detectors of obstacles found in the natural world?
Bees, for example.
The initial strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at the Japanese trade fair CEATEC, was inspired by the bumblebees engineers from Nissan. It was about how to build a new generation of systems to prevent collisions.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has developed a biomimetic robotic control system such as the BR23C, a robotic minicar equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
“During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety protective packaging,” explained Kazuhiro Doi, the brand’s general manager for technology PR and R&D.
An important role is played by the composite eyes, which allow bees to see in all directions at an angle of view of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the folded eye, engineers came up with the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 meters ahead of BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which instantly turns into an operation aimed at preventing a collision.
The obstacle is captured within a fraction of a second, after which the robotic car begins to imitate the movements of the bee, and turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent a collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this deflection manoeuvre takes place in an entirely instinctive manner.
“If this were not the case, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology fits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety shield, within which a collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
This process should not take longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding them, only the possibility of rotating, accelerating and decelerating was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, the important thing is instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process, much less the storage of data.
This mechanism has to process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
It does not need to store and respond to them using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it constantly uses only a memory size of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memory with giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing an instantaneous evasion technology that Nissan estimates could reach mass-produced vehicles within a decade.
Another application may be the connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles in the way, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
Damn dear baby already has a name
The $700 billion bailout bill, which is to be split into several instalments and aims to buy back bad bank loans, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further talks, which ended after midnight Eastern Time on Saturday, congressional officials reached an agreement in a multi-day debate on a $700 billion bailout package.
"We've made significant progress," Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the House of Representatives, said in a statement.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, also supported the compromise on the package.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said: "The programme will work and it will be effective, but more action needs to be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (i.e. at 2 a.m. CET on Monday), but it did not cause any special rise in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft law on the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which is to establish the program, and then it will be the turn of the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, after which the news of the agreement was welcomed by the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made last night and greatly appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
In fact, the program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal that a total of $700 billion should be spent to buy low-quality mortgage-backed securities at once.
It is now possible to spend a maximum of half of 700 billion in the first round, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the matter is expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Treasury Department will buy mortgage-backed securities that are rated as low-quality, the fate of the remaining $ 100 billion will then depend on the President’s decision.
The program will be controlled by a special body, of which the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank will also be a member.
The spending of the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactic in the sense of the law: it can simultaneously buy low-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, or other "poisonous" loans.
The purchase can take place within the framework of auctions and directly, said the competent representatives of the Ministry.
The legal norm will allow the firms concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Treasury Department provides them with a guarantee for funds that are cause for concern, for which the companies will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of the expected damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to meet the urgent demands of the US financial system to spend up to $ 700 billion, whether it is a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance or to prevent the systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major monetary institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, bank bosses who are in trouble and waiting for the state’s help can count on the government to cut their severance pay – which is simply called “golden parachute” in overseas slang.
Their payments will only be limited in certain cases and will depend on the type of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction essentially means that if the ministry makes purchases as part of an auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on gold parachutes unless the bank’s deceased directors are sent straight to retirement.
In the case of the direct purchase of low-quality loans, the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that the money for management is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the existing contracts on gold parachutes will not change, the restriction applies only to new contracts, which should be an additional incentive to participate in the programme.
“This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs,” House Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank said in a statement.
In addition, the State will have the right to acquire a stake in the banks participating in the programme, which will reduce the risk to the taxpayer, because once the economy and the rescued bank get back on their feet, they can also profit from this transaction.
The bill stipulates that in the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress setting out how taxpayers can recover expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were voices on both sides expressing doubts about the plan.
“This is not what the American people asked us to do, because taxpayer dollars are not going to protect us,” California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believes that it was precisely those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street who urged the adoption of the provisions.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1% in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared to 12.9 percent in August 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced.
Export sales prices in the industry were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008, decreasing by 3.9 percent year-on-year.

Also, domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sectors increased slightly, by 0.1%, compared to July.
The largest increase in prices took place in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8%), mainly due to the monthly increase in prices in the production of bags and saddlery products by 4.6% and footwear production by 2.5%, respectively.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly price increase in the chemical materials and products industry (1.6 percent).
Prices declined in the oil processing industry (1.4 percent), in the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the woodworking sector (0.1 percent).
Prices in the field of paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured price increases in the range of 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the production and distribution of electricity, gas and water, which has a high weight in the domestic sales of industry, prices increased by 0.3% in August, mainly due to the continuing impact of the officially determined increase in gas prices taking place from 1 July.
In the twelve-month comparison of domestic sales in individual sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices increased the most in the professional sector of oil processing (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector 13.2% was observed, in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which has a decisive weight, followed by an 11% increase in prices.
Prices fell in textiles and textile products (2.5 per cent) and electrical machinery and equipment (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the price growth rate ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.

In August, domestic sales showed the highest monthly price increase (0.7 percent) in the sectors involved in the production of tangible assets.
In the consumer goods sector, prices increased by 0.3%, while in the energy and further processing sectors, prices remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
The largest increase in prices compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in August 2008 in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods sectors, we measured a price increase of 6.8 percent, while for tangible assets, prices fell by 1.4 percent.
Export sales prices of industrial products, measured in forints, increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, down 3.9 percent in 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro in one month, by 7.1 percent against the dollar, by 7.5 percent against the euro in August 2007 and by 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Going to the United States without a visa?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is high hope that the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force around January 12, the foreign minister spoke in Chicago before leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, "almost everything now depends only on the fact that an electronic system of permitting roads, or controls, will be built abroad in time".
At the same time, she warned that the new system will not include a permit for entry, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
As of today, the representative of the Hungarian diplomacy continues the negotiations in Washington.
She will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit for the Republic of Hungary, and hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of a bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major US parties, unanimously pledged their support on Sunday for the government’s $700 billion bailout package, but there are also politicians demanding the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
After a several-day marathon of meetings between Congress and administration officials, early Sunday morning it was announced that a basic agreement had been reached on the bank bailout package.
The financial package, aimed at melting down the Wall Street crisis and frozen credit markets, has become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain have consistently identified themselves as the more suitable candidate to pull the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, as economic issues have come to the forefront, Obama has again gained some advantage and McCain’s lead, which he secured after the Republican convention by nominating Sarah Palin as vice president, has vanished.
Obama expressed hope Sunday at an election rally in Detroit that the 700-billion-dollar bill would be swiftly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly ... your places, your savings, your entire industry, the stability of the entire economy are in danger," he said.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain’s ideas about the economy outdated.
McCain told ABC: "It's going to be a bit of annoyance for everyone, but doing nothing is simply not a way to go."
As the Republican senator pointed out, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission supervising the finance minister and the severance pay limits he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no more important role in the talks than he had been in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Overview of the printing of the German language area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - thus analyzing the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In an online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article titled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Fathers".
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian Socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria for decades - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
Changing periods is a problem for the entire Christian democracy, and thus for Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Saturday a process that could have been predicted for almost exactly ten years ended: the undisputed hegemony of one state party.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent threshold.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, during the period so often remembered by Stoiber.
The reason is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country, which is devouring its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at a very rapid rate they have been mistaken. However, secularization, educational results, the settlement of Germans from the east and from the north in the developing regions of Bavaria could not be without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is associated with an increase in opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU has been the most disconnected from the classical bourgeoisie; people in the liberal profession, entrepreneurs, individuals with graduation and higher education.
Support for the CSU has already fallen below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who, with whom? Party chairmen are reticent on coalition issues", the conservative Viennese daily deals with the confused internal political situation created as a result of the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> seems to be open to all negotiations, the Greens do not want to negotiate a coalition yet.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party leaders did not take much look at their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> President Werner Faymann has confirmed that he wishes to hold talks with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
And the SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some Länder and in the social partnership it exists.
Faymann left the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was overrated for every fall.
Repeating this direction is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open in the party, these issues need to be discussed decisively within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> Chairman Jörg Haider once again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibilities," Haider said.
The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken.
The European Equality Summit, hosted by France, the current presidency of the European Union, kicked off in Paris today.
Lívia Járóková, a member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the expert debate, in her message addressed to the plenary, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The summit conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, the European social partners, the most important European rights organisations and civil society associations working in the field of equal opportunities met to negotiate.
According to the press office of the Fidesz group of MEPs, Járóková pointed out that in addition to the discrimination that occurs in recruitment, Roma are driven out of the European labour market mainly because of their low education.
"The overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education, and due to the poor quality of primary education, only a small part of them can reach a higher level of education."
Járóková also stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to establish awareness of these connections in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise taxes, he contributes to the national budget.
"Roma citizens have the right of their citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their poor quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the MEP, the cohesion of the European Union is necessary, with an emphasis on the objective and the negotiations, in order to speed up the processes of school desegregation immediately, and it is of paramount importance that the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations are properly respected.
"We need to break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we need to give Roma children the opportunities given by the democratic space, so that they can participate in the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóková demanded.
Everyone is guaranteed the objective of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been organised annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination set at the level of the whole of Europe and the individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary Grace
The fate of Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October.
Despite the shameful election debacle, heads have not yet fallen, the debate on personal issues has been postponed by the leaders of the Bavarian CSU.
The party's chairman Erwin Huber and the country's prime minister, Günther Beckstein, may still remain in their posts, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes, will be decided last weekend by the extraordinary Congress of the party.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized duo let themselves be heard that they would not cling to their posts with all their might.
They tried to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who, because of the loss of an absolute majority, demanded a day after the “Bavarian tsunami” to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago - indeed, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career - the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but its strength was only 43.4 percent.
In Bavaria, the CSU has been producing 18 percent of Germany’s GDP as a “self-ruler” for 46 years.
While the conservatives in the southern federal state, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, continue to hold a high position, they will be forced into a coalition in the future anyway.
One of the first signs of the reorganization within the party is the fact that the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be a possible Huber’s candidate, will be a member of a narrow intelligence team that will launch probing negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP or the right-wing Free Voters.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli, the candidate of the Free Voters, got into the parliament, whose speech against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out a coup, but then with an ambitious municipal policy they made a mercilessly short process.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energies on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition period, Stoiber, who has so far been spinning threads from the background, will also play an active role, calling 28 September the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made several scathing remarks to the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played a major role in the national success of 2005, somehow puts itself together.
According to Merkel, who has struggled to hide her disappointment over the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin Grand Coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating a wounded CSU will not be easier, and the Social Democrat crisis continues.
The SPD in Bavaria achieved its weakest result since 1946 with 18.6 percent.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
Not a single opposition MP was elected to the Belarusian parliament on Sunday.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), by the illegalities that occurred during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10-million-strong country has been lacking opposition for well over a decade, the opposition grouped under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's election seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who retained a constitutional change in the elections with a controversial turnout in 2006, would re-elect his president several times in 2006 and for the fourth time.
The ODS also dropped the boycott that had been contemplated.
Against the backdrop of the opposition’s expectation was that Russia’s economically increasingly dependent Belarus – which took a loan to mitigate the impact of Russia’s ever-expensive natural gas imports and also contributed to Beltransgaz, which owns gas pipelines passing through the country, to get into Russian hands – wished politically to improve relations with Luoru as anti-government with the European Union.
It has previously pointed out that in evaluating the election campaign, the OSCE emphasized positive developments rather than shortcomings - for example, the ban on the candidacy of a third of opposition candidates.
However, Monday's flash report of the OSCE already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press, in particular, the fact that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there is an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow, while still refusing to recognize the breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a two-month state, considers Belarus as a landlocked state.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that it should remain so, despite the fact that "the power was afraid to let a single member of the opposition into the insignificant parliament".
Looking at the results of the opposition, it does not plan protest actions, but rather tries to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities put obstacles in the distribution, but I still see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly," Milinkevich said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security as its greatest success, does not consider the strata as correct or officially the most supported.
"Due to the country's debt and the growing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security 'provoking silence of the cemetery' collapses," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
The head of the CIS mission, Sergey Lebedev, told Russia’s Ria Novosti news agency that “people don’t believe in words but in deeds”, so the absence of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that revolving doors have been introduced at the arrival and departure of employees.
But from today, this new measure will work against cunning people, against those who inject themselves and then go for coffee during working hours.
The anti-lazy news was announced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renate Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
“The revolving door,” says Brunetta, “is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services.”
"A new era of accountability and transparency will now open up.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
With the Chigi Palace, we will complete the introduction of the Council Presidency in all the buildings.
For Masi, "the choice of swing doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections from the staff, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a joint action with the staff and the cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast during business hours; no more coffee and croissants.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Professional School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months, the absence of public employees due to the disease has been reduced by 50%, that is, by 60 thousand more people per year at work.
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
“Its payroll dynamics – explains the minister – has doubled in the last 8-10 years relative to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate.”
Meanwhile, thousands of public servants have gathered to reject the standards of Brunett’s decree in accordance with a request supported by Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Administration today will present the figures for lower absenteeism due to illness,” writes the Consumer Protection Association, “the nation of ‘urgent sloths’ is growing steadily.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public administration employees who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
Tara will be protested primarily against the exclusion of supplements for sick leave, which depends on the activity; the extension of the time during which it is possible to check the patient, the time period during which the check-up visits will be carried out, and other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Work Accidents, Napolitano: "Resolute Prevention"
Every day, there are 2,500 accidents at work in Italy, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
The Inail figures confirm that in 2007 we had about 1,200 deaths from work-related accidents.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice the number of deaths compared to murders.
To renew the attention of institutions, social media and information about this dramatic problem, Anmil celebrates today in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Victims of Work-related Accidents, set for the second Sunday in October.
“The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm the importance of the issue of occupational safety,” President Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in a message sent to President Anmil by the National Association for the Disabled and Disabled for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his deep admiration for the continuous joint efforts to ensure safety in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and the participation of public opinion.
“Naturally, an outraged ‘enough’ was raised, sincerely shared in the face of tragedies that, by their scale, stir up turmoil in the media and public participation, but everyday reality again offers us dramatic cases, even repeating itself in its dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and awareness.
The numerous initiatives put in place in the field of education are of particular importance in order to raise awareness among young people facing the world of work.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its disturbing social significance, to apply and improve legislative norms.
Chamber President Gianfranco Fini, for his part, underlined "how the phenomenon of death from an occupational accident creates an absolutely critical social state, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make convincing efforts towards the necessary end of this state."
"As for the data on occupational accidents, they seem to be showing some positive turnover, but this does not deny that the number of deaths from occupational accidents is alarming anyway," President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli remarked.
“We don’t want this ‘reducing effort’ to lead to less attention, because the moment the attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
“In general, we believe that too little is being done to stop the problem of accidents, and there are many activities that can have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion, to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, right from school age."
"More efforts are needed," he added, "in terms of communication and participation of public opinion.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon.
Mercandelli said it was a “progressive degeneration of the levels of entitlement to compensation envisaged for labour victims” and the “deferral of supportive care” that the system has been getting into in recent years.
“The goal is to give back the insurance guarantee to the worker,” he added, “because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or the gift from time to time by the legislator.”
Mp3 Players Charged, Puts Hearing at Risk
Listening to loud music for long periods of time and using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a statement published today by the European Commission, which in an official report disseminated in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Committee on Science on the health risks that have recently arisen and have been identified (Crseri) Eu.
“From this scientific opinion, we read in the notes, it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music devices for at least five years, weekly for more than an hour a day and keep the device at high volumes risk permanent hearing loss.”
“It worries me that such a large number of young people, who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels, can unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” admits Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific findings," the leader continues, "implie a clear risk and need to respond swiftly.
Most importantly, we need to encourage consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding to make them fully effective and keep pace with the new technology.”
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate the problem due to the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists - concluded the EU executive - confirm the need to worry and now the European Commission is examining, together with other members and parties who have raised the issue, what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices."
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by overexposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee of the EU states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will exceed the current limits corresponding to the maximum allowed noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be estimated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno will leave the Commission for the Future of the Capital free
We will start today, we will close in March, we will have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidoglio to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the commission will compile the handbooks for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councillor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas - he wants to emphasize Alemanno - It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political arbitrators who remain Giunta e Municipal Council.
It is not about any exchange of functions, but only about trying to have some place where to process a large project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then dissolved, because this institution must have an exact timeframe.
In June, we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.”
To those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary because its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno will reply: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are of the same quality as Commission Attali's proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, their contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics spills over the daily problems and urgencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously for the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary enterprise nor a bluff: it is completely free, the Roman citizens will not cost a single euro and will serve to reflect and engage the best intelligence that the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic outline as a starting point, neither definitive nor immobile, in order to allow our city an authentic rise at the level it urgently needs, and to think in a united spirit of its future."
The future, the mayor of Rome said, “will not be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look much further” not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of the capital, but “will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean”.
Obama? The first anti-American president. We already know why
A well-known American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.”
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise just as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on the website: “This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he’s going to get to the highest office of a nation that had two governors and five black senators!”
In fact, these attacks do not say much"; they are attacks of unequivocal racial origin and do not answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then we have the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
One Mississippi newspaper, from the bowels of the southern United States, commented: “For once in the polls we know well who the American patriot is going to vote for.
There is one side of the American mentality that has remained stagnant until the last moment.
Say whatever you want, we’ll take care of who we tick, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these considerations for the Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his term? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq has become a weakness for most of Bush.
Whoever takes the place of Georgia W will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the US was felt even by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and their assumptions about the future.
Nowadays, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say they had less credibility concerns.
They don’t feel as isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is the crisis of a ruined economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put the newspaper together, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism as understood by the general public to change fundamentally.
The American journalist is plagued by clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten print journalists and senior executives believe that national journalism is going the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcasting.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
Larger publishers are paving the way for the Internet, which many see as a “killer” of print.
The “economic pressure” that journalists point out has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists said they resorted to technology in the hope that it would “do something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms—that is, executives—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value falls to 23%.
This has something to do with job security for someone.
Managers who think they will lose their jobs within three years are 47% at the national level.
As for journalists, they are at 30%.
As for the "certain work" regarding staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In a nation as vast as the U.S., with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it’s a matter of taking it or letting it.
Managers almost always receive huge salaries, and the editor can earn as much as ten thousand dollars a month apart from paying pensions and insurance.
As far as holidays are concerned, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, up to fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within a year.
It is just a question of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROMA, TANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse the filing of the real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who requested to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with a counter-offer on the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he was released from house arrest last week, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a real estate entrepreneur change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which the PM has spoken out) would allow him to influence his company and gain access to the evidence accusing him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon was manifested a few days ago, when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout plan presented by the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is dividing the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, the milder one, accommodating to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, is conservative, hostile to the “those in Washington” and the middle part, and to the world of finance.
The soul that arrogantly manifested itself in the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
But this matter just quoted is but an example of the changes, the great changes, which the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
Both in the U.S. and in Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator for phenomena that have been in incubation for a long time, that are solidifying in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the double category of State-Power in relation to a certain re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state, are mainly involved.
This has at the same time created a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families, who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be substantially out of the question or to have little to say: the European Union, which, as always, is divided between different interests and different national strategies, and which is unable to decide on a single common political line, has given clear evidence.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, the rescue plans, the market recovery, the new rules and, most importantly, the distribution of funds: at the moment when we get into distress, only the states have the economic means, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to put everything in order.
And they also have the necessary means and powers to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose of to a similar degree.
This new emphasis, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, moreover, in full accord with the ever-increasing importance which the recent economic progress is trying to attribute to one factor closely connected with it: territorial affiliation.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the realms of the grid, increasingly sophisticated technology, imetrial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future, on the other hand, would have to deal with such little intangible things as oil, water, grain, etc.
All things, who would have said it, can be transported from one place on earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to a bounded space, a territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler certainly has far more cards in his sleeve than whoever isn't, and whoever has the bad luck of living in a place without grain, without oil, and without water.
I come to the second novelty, which, however, predicts a breakthrough.
Whoever speaks of territory, of state, of government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, of leadership.
Given the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be forming.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who can grasp the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit against existing leadership, especially economic ones, which turned out to be equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: discredit, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence that seeks to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems, in fact, that convictions are spreading more and more among the broad masses of the population, rather than that their actions are the same as the ideas of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed their time and is indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds one branch of the right from the underground, but the strong movement for the elimination of the ruling classes and the traditional political order is manifested in sudden electoral "resistance" or in unexpected changes in collective moods in the last and most recent time, from the conservative rise of the British to the Congress in Great Britain, to the Congress in Lausanne and Bavaria.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have increasing difficulties to understand, that is, to represent, which, not from today, is being created in the deep strata of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is once again strengthening, expanding, potentially going too far.
Before that, it would be exaggerated to speak of a permanent "mass rebellion".
But we certainly can't say that it means keeping our eyes open.
Super glue for walking on walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on the walls as Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
The scientists managed to keep a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall using a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters.
STUDY – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by a team of researchers, is a development of existing materials that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
“The glue base can be imagined as a series of tubes laid out as a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the gecko's legs, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure perfect adhesion.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, showed that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles and at the same time "simply peels off from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at Dayton University.
- "This material could be useful as a temporary glue" adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps yes, but researchers are thinking of a far less fascinating use as a connection of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
FURTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkley, California, is also researching a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists presented a microfiber-formed adhesive as hair that cleans itself of dust by moving it over the surface to still retain perfect adhesion.
Medications: never with juices
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their intake changes the potency with serious consequences for health.
In order for David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, to highlight the risks of both ready-made and fresh juices combined with the intake of certain medications, the 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia is raising a new alarm effect: one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the risk of their health.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to toxic levels the effects of certain antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in a bulletin two years ago, urging doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to be careful what they drink if they take medications such as Diazepam or Methadone.
Not just grapefruit – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
A long list of effects muted by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, Director of Pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: "Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmacy agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you get, and if you come across something unclear, do not worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification,” the expert emphasized for the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New Zealander who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration's foreign, economic, and political actions.
A few months after the September 2001 bombings, on the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman predicted in a New York Times commentary that the second event would be much more important than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A prophecy which had caused much controversy, and which had been reproached to him for years, but which had proved to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and shocked at the speed with which collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from the public eye,” Krugman said in a statement late in 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is “an economist of great importance” but also a popularizer who has a “very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush liberal administration.”
Open Office, here we have the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It’s the release day of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal production package that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more familiar Microsoft Office.
After about a year of volunteer work, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office appears to the general public with various novelties: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window will be added another, much more essential, as compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac OS X and support for the new version of the ODF format (Open ISO Standart 1.2).
Emphasis is also placed on collaboration with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open a document with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models, such as what allows you to reduce the size of a PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer a PDF folder to a graphics model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create "PDF hybrid" documents that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet or text program.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in Excel, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each co-worker is assigned one color for comments to be more clearly identified in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to transfer some of the features of Open Office to the Web (on the cloud), and should reimagine the final result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation CD can be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the topic of freeware can be a drag to expand in homes, it is on the Open Office business area that the package bets a lot, and can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there is no shortage of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video typing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, after all, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and if we consider that to date we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of a new version it is possible that this predicted number can even be exceeded.
Also Kohl's results are positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third-class and winner of the best mountaineer's shirt.
The report was quoted by the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive for Cer, Epo of the third generation, after Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall into those that were performed in recent weeks by the laboratories of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analyses confirm positive on Cera, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will face two years of disqualification.
The news of Kohl’s positiveness for the third-generation Epoch is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government about the result.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning a dotted shirt of the best mountaineer.
IMMIGRANTS: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants only in the last house has turned into a priority target of immigrants" received with resistance.
This turns a beautiful country into a nation of racists? So asks a long New York Times article, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of a young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern areas are both the ones where "more integration and more work" is registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League".
To confirm rising tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by Lega, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together to defeat racism.
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, a tenant union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that entire strata of students have lost the right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear,” explains Laura Mariani, head of Sunia’s studios, “the high demand from students in this city has distorted the market in such a way that it has spurred a process of price increases that has spread even to residents.”
In most cases, lease offers contain several offences: contracts freely, unregistered, without a limited lease, associated sub-lease.
For Sunja, an exceptional intervention is needed, which could regulate prices thanks to the revision of taxes.
If we look at the details of the research, we can see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros for a single bed, a single room is paid from the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) through the average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to the maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the university, you need 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double.
Values are slightly lower (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>550 per single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room zones Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, a bed costs 300/450 euros, a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where rent is the most common phenomenon for students from outside the European Union, one more anomalies is finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% in the fee they want for foreign students, compared to Italian ones.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities are canceling historic halls
The cinematographic historical halls are closed in favour of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas is like a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
The painting offered by director Giuseppe Tornatoro successfully documents what is happening in the large Italian urban centers, as well as in rural towns.
The process of restricting cinemas, the birth of large multi-salaries in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of monosalas in the central zones of cities is one of the events that seems inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the features of a real cultural crime.
"It's like losing a friend, an acquaintance, with whom we shared a piece of the journey and a lot of emotions," feels the director of New Cinema Paradiso, a film that twenty years ago won Tornator an Oscar and a big jury award in Cannes, and who told the story of a life and a life of a villager.
The figures obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed their doors, and the highest bill was paid mainly by halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures, Emilia-Romagna comes first with a loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the onset of the multiplex is precisely these three Italian regions, which have registered the highest number of new cinema multisales: 195 more canvases in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 more in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian approach has evolved irrationally,” says Paolo Protti, president of Anecu, “it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all of its visitors are willing to move to the multiplex.
Then let us not even talk about the insufficient subsidy to the fund for the benefit of operators: the previous national debt is about EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a disgrace that the government does not respect existing laws.
Between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed to support the sector.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned with closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the village and Aneca, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centers and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are the steps of tax relief in favor of operators and the benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to drive into the zone with limited traffic and will have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
“I like this initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope other cities will follow Bologna’s example by introducing other measures.”
However, it is certain that in order to stand up to the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to found the “New Paradiso Cinema” that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the already closed Rialto or Quirinale in Nazionale Street, where I have shared so much emotion that I do not have to look at the inscriptions blackened by dust, I turn to the other side.
The connection between the politician and the mafia group 'ndrangheta, Mayor Gioia Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adjust the city's election to the interests of the Mafia group Pyromalli."
The charges brought by the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria against Mayor and Vice Mayor Gioi Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, imprisoned this morning because of external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are heavy.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the namesake of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia nature, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
“They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense,” the prosecutors wrote, as the two local governments expressed their willingness to pay for consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
“This would allow the mafia group to officially enter the city’s offices and facilitate the already enormous possibilities of controlling and managing public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian regional commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld are abundant in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndrangheta, heroes who are still spotless."
The arrests this morning follow a July arrest last year by which police showed that the mafia group Pyromalli had received the final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the Gioii Tauro City Council was dissolved in 1991, the reason being the supposed connection between organized crime and local government - local politicians were deprived of their posts in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, was elected head of the center-right coalition at the time of its dissolution after a narrow election in May.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called on the then deputy interior minister, Marco Minniti, to answer and accused him of planning everything for political reasons, but judges in the detention order signed this morning explain that the mob group has even gone so far as to ask for a change to the A3 highway project.
Other interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, the prosecutors write, showed "a willingness to move the claims of the businessman, a representative of a larger group very close, as is commonly known, to Piromalli, and to adapt the public administration's choices to the interests of the mafia group."
When energy is born from waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an endless deposit that covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are the new sources of inexhaustible energy that colossus like Chevron have been eyeing and are now trying to put their hands on these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for more than a century, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went astray. But now environmental organizations and a new increase in the price of oil gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that about 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by using the movement of sea waves.
This amount would be twice the amount of energy currently produced in nuclear centers.
In addition, there are currents and tides.
Giants are attacking.
the company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this plan was announced, it seemed like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than on traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” a spokesperson for a company that is connected to the U.S. oil colossus said in the economic daily Wall Street Journal, “and they are thinking about the possibility of working with us.”
The cooperation we are considering relates to obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project on the use of marine energy in Alaska.
This signal cannot be underestimated, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, show growing interest, according to observers.
Technology that needs to be developed.
Experts talk about the technology, which is still in its infancy, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
So far, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small in size and do not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on dilution.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are interconnected with each other.
The force of the waves, which moves up and down with the buoys, is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure rotates the turbine, which supplies power to the generator.
The energy gets to the shore by undersea cables.
For now, there are four projects of this type pending federal approval and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
By contrast, Verdant Power is already generating power for the shopping mall and parking lot using six submarine turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of the water during the tide causes the rotation of the turbines, which feed the generator with this rotational movement.
Verdant said that they have a long list of clients who are waiting for the necessary authorization due to the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Particular interest at this point deserves the potential of tides, say the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although this is an incoherent factor, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It is in tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
