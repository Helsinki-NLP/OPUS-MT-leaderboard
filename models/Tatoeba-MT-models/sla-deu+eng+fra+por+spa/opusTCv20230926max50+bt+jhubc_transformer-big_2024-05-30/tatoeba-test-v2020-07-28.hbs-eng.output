It was love at first sight.
Stand up.
I'm not ready yet.

Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.

Everyone else is.

Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
How deep is that lake?
What year is your car?
What's your name again?
You have three cats.
Tom never said anything about it.
You're too young.
Don't stretch.
Tom never asked why.
I wouldn't hurt you.
We have no such example.
Come over here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
I know who killed him.

Will you talk to Tom for me?
I bought this yesterday.
How do you say “cat” in Spanish?
We need to act now.
I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
I haven't seen him in a long time.
We're here to play golf.
I haven't seen her in a while.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.

I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
Good, how are you?
This is, without a doubt, an embarrassing situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She runs every morning before breakfast.
This time it leads to the city.
I'm not happy with that.
I baked my tongue.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.

That's a table.
Flowers are blooming.
What a pity!

I've got plenty of room.
What are you going to do today?
I'm just thinking out loud.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about the stolen money.
That train passed you.
Come and see us.
A young man is often reckless.
I don't think he knows I love you.

Always trouble when it comes to my kid.
No, not yet.
One day she wants to study abroad.
Check this out.
Come quickly!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of the painful memories.
You're absolutely right.
No, I don't know.
I'm convinced.
Add more water!
Music is important to me.
I've been working on it day after day.

Please, come here.
Take it easy!
No one has a soul.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Where there is grass, there is no water. Where there is water, there is no grass.
My friend got 95 points on her math exam.

I'm not going to school tomorrow.
There is no word in Russian for “freedom.”
I thought you were gonna be busy.
It's great.
Could that be true?
Just be quiet, Tom.
That bag is mine.
Tom left before I got here.
Tell us a ghost story!
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
I want to live in the city.
What are you going to do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more than one thing at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
Your desire is my command.
I'll call her tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
Tom is Mary's grandfather.
Ammonia is the base.
Check it again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
She was educated in the United States.
Tell me what I have to do.
Open your mouth!
I haven't been told anything.
The fire spread to the neighboring building before the firefighters arrived.
Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary did.
I thought this was going to happen months ago.
The bad weather prevented me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke was coming out of the chimney.
I know the gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
It is one of the biggest summer music festivals.
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
Shut your mouth and sit down.
- What's this? - What?
He took off.
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
He's American.
Tom only talks to Mary.
No doubt about it.
The first lesson is easy.
You've put on weight so fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
We're brother and sister.
I'm pretty good at doing more than one thing at the same time.
No one is as fast as you.
I agreed to buy it.
She's in such a bad mood.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please, be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let your imagination run wild.
Okay, how about you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't go in that room.
What have you done to me?
It's all here.
Why me?
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
If you do, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
You are a balm for the soul.
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have interfered in your stupid business.
The light disappeared on its own.
Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
Ask the policeman!
We have five fingers on each hand.
We worked together.
Do you think I missed something?

Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me nuts.
What do newspapers write?
The system has been repaired after three years of volunteer work.

She received four e-mails.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are up to something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom was able to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not an easy sport.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I just don't want to do it.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It's their right to vote.
I find it hard to put into words what I mean.
Tell me where you are.
Will we see Tom again?
Turn right at the next corner.
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
Woman eats bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
Do you know why I'm here?
I hope they don't notice my mistake.
I must have eaten something bad.
We'll be leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Tom can't swim like he used to.
Everybody knows I don't like Tom.
Both answers are possible.
Tom's working too hard.
Avoid addicts on the paint thinner.
I liked that one.
He did not hide his disappointment.
The boy has a horse.
Do you like roller coasters?
We're out of food.
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
It's a nice day.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
Proletarians of all lands, unite!
I'm very impressed.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
Italy is located in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom a lot.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
You have a right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You have to work harder.
Why are you so paranoid?
He walked around the room, unable to calm down.
Could I get a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
What does he want to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She wonders how this is possible.
Santa Claus lives on the North Pole.
He was born in Ohio.
Please, go.
Oh, look at that.
Wake up, wake up!
You picked a nice one.
Look how big it is!
I was trying to be nice.
Mary is a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I'm having a hard time talking about my feelings.
I'll give you anything you want.
It's their book.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom's gonna get here.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
She can't be bribed.
Will you turn off the lights?
I'll save you.
I'll keep you posted.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black grand piano with dramatic finger strokes, creating music that is very pleasant to listen to.
Strong winds broke many branches from the trees last night.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
We need to prepare the ground for negotiations.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?

They laughed at his mistake.
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
Every ship needs a captain.
It's time to get up.
The house is built of brick.
I didn't write this.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
People have been good to me.
I know this is weird.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried it?
Dr. Jackson has a good relationship with the patient.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Are you a student?

I could go with you.
Here, have some.
Come on in.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
How many blankets are on the bed?
You really don't need to do that.
Why are you so smart?
I'm cooking lunch.
I wonder what Tom's planning to do.
I'm fat.
In order to join the choir, you need to be able to read the notes.
Tom took a nap.
They wanted an apology.
What did I do wrong?
Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I take vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Obviously, I was too optimistic.
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
You're not done yet?
You're very rude.
He makes good money.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is good for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for a human being to always put himself ahead of the interests of others.
I eat here.
It's all right. It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
He was named captain of the football team.
Why are you still up? You should go to bed.
I was at school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Stunned, insensitive children can sometimes grow up to be sociopaths.
I'd like it to be with you.
It's the police's job to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you pass me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
After you.
We all work too hard.
I'm Ricardo.
Thank you for all you have done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom learns very quickly.
You're different.
She doesn't know the hatred of others.
This will make our job a lot easier.
He loves football.
What time can you come?
The monks were able to play tennis in monasteries.
No one believes him anymore.
Keep children away from medications.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if maybe I was dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
No one's going anywhere.
The game may be postponed until next week.
I have a soul.
An hour and a half drive to work.
That's right.
Your time will soon come.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
It doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
It's right here.
I'll think of something.
It all started a year ago when he came home.
Play it again, Sam.
Do you drink coffee?
Some of us think that such views are pure madness.
It's working.
Somebody could get hurt.
Tom didn't write a single letter to Mary until he was there.
We've had enough of you.
You won't be able to handle this job.
We all know it's Tom's fault.
She's Chinese.
I don't want to drink vodka.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
He needs it.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom's got the bigger end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
I'm more worried about you than the future of Japan.
I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a slight nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
I got soaked to the skin.
Come and play with us.
And it was only with great distress.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Few people know it exists.
Did you write down the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on my math exam.
The worst headaches are caused by insufficiently understood ideas.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Check this out.
- What's your name?
They're trying.
My future is in your hands.
He's a fake, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Tom is cold-blooded.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
Can you tell the difference between silver and tin?
Hands up!
I don't exercise as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
She doesn't speak English, let alone French.
That's so sad.
How clever!
You should know better.
In short, I don't agree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
She's a teacher.
Without water it is impossible to live.
I used to play the piano a long time ago, so I can still play a little.
Is this your glass, or your sister's?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter have been together for two generations.
We're finally here!
He's in good hands.
He had to work two hours a day in the garden.
Apples and pears are given away, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
The teacher's excuse is almost perfect.
Do you want to learn something specific?
I really like to exercise.
I love you, man.
I'm really proud of that.
We were in last place.
I've contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
I can read German, but I can't say it.
That doesn't look like you.
She achieved her goal.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
Madness has crossed the line.
Isn't that black?
This isn't a children's book.
You're absolutely right.
Come, sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
As if I didn't know that!
Let's not talk about this now.
Have a good time.
It's time to part.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a wealthy merchant.
Execution of the meeting is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.
- What's this? - What?
What are you eating anyway?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
A man hopes for as long as he lives.
You be careful.
Let's discuss the options.
Don't worry, if you help me, everything will be fine.
I stared at the miracle.
It was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "But do you remember the one she sent you when you asked her to give you pictures of Applejack's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write a review of Mack's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a review to Mack." "Yes."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I overlook that?
I don't want to take any more of your time.
I only go to church out of respect for my mother.
It is better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
"Did he justify it?" "Yes."
Not every lamp is magical.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
He killed himself.
I was very excited.
You don't have to eat right before going to bed.
Tom will wait.
What's gonna happen now?
I need five more minutes.
The students did not know how to respond.
He's ashamed of lying.
I'm not a night owl.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
I'm not a doctor.
My baby wants to talk.
It's good to see you again.
Tom bought me a VIP ticket.
I'm fat.
I'm the one who should be doing that.
Tom's gonna call.
He lit a torch before entering the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a really good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
These girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth in what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your whining.
Get out of here!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make way.
The horse must have tripped and the knight fell off the horse.
I haven't forgotten.
There are islands at sea.
I'm investigating it right now.
Mini skirts are fashionable again.
What are we really looking for?
She's achieved her goal.
Tom can do whatever he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
Hurry up!
He couldn't understand much of what they were saying to each other.
This medicine will ease your headache.
He disappeared without a trace.
Oh, leave me alone.
He likes both.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home now.
He never takes the train.
He's addicted to Starbucks.
The book's on the table.
There will be two talks this week.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
Cardboard is stronger than paper.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
Fadil changed his mind.

You defend yourself.
He took a taxi to the hospital.
This goes beyond all boundaries.
My house looks south.
I miss you so much.
Can you juggle?
Don't touch the lion while he sleeps.
Tom is unlike me.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
To be honest, I don't know.
It's your election.
Yeah, that makes sense.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw a dog.
Maybe she has other plans?
That's not a sentence.
Thank you all for coming! See you next time.
The patient died out.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
This evidence leaves no room for doubt, this can by no means be the original work of Picasso.
Am I that different?
He's focused on that.

I've got to go.
It feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
The window is made of glass.
I'll find the money somehow.

They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
She's Argentine.

What's your name?
I'm done. I'm done.
Man is part of nature.
I wasn't exactly impressed with that.
Tom wanted to see Mary's room.
I left Tom in 2013.
Do you know anything about Tom?
I'm drinking coffee.
Choose one.

I'll leave it to you.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
Tom needs a dream.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
We're ready to go.
I don't live in that town.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.

It's my habit to do that.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked if he could use my computer.
I took him to the most expensive restaurant on campus.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
They were on a plane from Berlin to Istanbul.
- Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll keep you posted.
I reacted instinctively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
I'm deeply embarrassed.
My mom just went shopping.
He was a bare-breasted and bare-breasted man.
She's just out of my league.
What exactly are we looking for?
I want to be with her.
Why are you all in shock?
The apples are red.
Why do you think that?
Schools and roads are tax-paying services.
What's wrong with the doctor?
Don't push.
Looks like it's just the two of us.
They don't pay you enough.
Things are very different today.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
I couldn't stop crying.
Justice in this country has a double standard: justice for the poor and justice for the rich.
What's your friend's name?
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it the old way.
Where's Tehran?
I mean, so I did.

Sounds like a betrayal to me.

Mom, I'm hungry.
We're all eager to see the movie.
I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
We can save some time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why this language? Because it is beautiful and stimulates our learning at the same time. The international language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. After all, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you get some sleep?
I'll take you to Tom's.
He's watching the Olympics.
Could it have been Tom?
A little bird told me.
I have three beautiful grandchildren.
The neighbors on the floor above me are very loud.
Don't fight.
She got her fingers on the table.

Forgive me, I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
Everyone laughed.
You're good to everyone.
Tom pointed to the sky.
I wasn't interested.
That's not true, is it?
She has twenty children.
Tom said he didn't see anything weird.
I think we'll get to Boston before dark.
You're never on time.
That sounds like betrayal to me.
I'll make sure I don't bother you while you're in college.
Life is short.
What was I supposed to do?
What makes you think Tom would do that?
They'll know.
I didn't have a good time last night.
You're innocent.
All participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
When Marcus arrived, I was asleep.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's gonna make progress.
No one can open the door.
Tom was terrified.
Whose guitar is this?
Greece has many islands.
This won't hurt at all.
We've got to get out of here.
The thief escaped.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not picky.
Eat everything.
That's what I'm used to doing.
Get out of here!
Tom's still at work.
Tom wasn't very good.
You think better when you close your eyes.
Is there anything else?
Either way, you're wrong.
You need more than coffee.
That's the norm.
Are we all here?
He knows a lot of people.
I'm dizzy.
I feel bad because I lied.
Tom groaned in pain.
It's all or nothing.
I left my credit card at the house.
Everyone says I look like my father.
Do they love each other?
I've contributed.
I'll sign.
You're embarrassing him.
Yeah, that's right.
We hope you like it.
Let me in.
Will the future be like science fiction?
It just happened again.

I hope he's okay.
The wind calmed down.
I can't make him happy.
This is Communism.
There are subtle differences between these two pictures.
I have a floor-to-ceiling mirror in my bedroom.
I wish I'd remembered that.
Don't say a word.
What can you do?
Excuse me, can you repeat that?
Get out of there.
Scientists interpret it in a different way.
When can you come?
The check-check festival took place in Latvia.
Life begins when we realize who we really are.
We are what we are.
Your time is up.
Some people, regardless of their age, do not lose their beauty.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in.
Let him pay for what he did.
She also loves books.
I'll stay home tomorrow.
No one's coming to save you.
I have no desire to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
I have good eyesight.
- You ready? - Yeah.
She's proud of her talent.
This box is almost empty.
You can start right now.
Are you done yet?
You need one of these.
Sit down.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
Failure is the spice that gives taste to success.
How is this your fault?
Security has been increased in the city.
My wife's name is Lidia Zarebowa.
Cheers! Cheers!
Tom's staying.
Who discovered the island?
That boy talks like he's an adult.
The carrots cost $3.
My motorcycle's new.
Tom told me today that he loves me.
I don't think Tom knows that.
Can I walk you home?
I've tried that before.
Go upstairs.
No parking is allowed there.
I'm running in the morning.
Tom thinks the same way.
It's pronounced like this:
That's how he plays big.
Turn left.
No way! No way!
How long did you stay?
Tom is a passionate cyclist.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
He'll be here soon.
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's take a look.

Would you like to join us?
What did you learn today?
We liked the food, especially the fish.
And they lived happily ever after.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
You're very rude.
Don't stare.
Read this.
I walk like a penguin.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom was accidentally made.
Marcus became a usurper.
Is the handsome man Arab or Hindi?
Let's meet for a drink.

I'm gonna try.
Do I ever make a mistake?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's an official job.

Forget about him.
I agreed to buy it.
What's in the newspapers?
The surface temperature of the sun is about 600°C.
He asked a lot of questions about Islam.
If we leave now, we'll be in Boston by 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where's Tom sleeping?
Emily was surprised.
I'm not ready yet.
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to know what really happened.
She ran her fingers through her hair.
He works hard to support his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom's downstairs.
Tom says he has four houses in five different countries.
We arrived at a hotel in Rome.
Let's see what Tom has to say.
Mary began to take off her clothes.
I'm starving.
Don't fight.
Come over here.
The limits of my language are the limits of my world.
You want to meet him?
That's better. That's better.
Look over there.
In the morning, we found a stranded dolphin.
I'm reading this book.
Just tell me you're okay.
Please accept this little gift.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I'm not afraid of getting older.
I don't fully agree with you.
There are many possible answers to this question.
Let's have some ice cream now, before it melts.
I'm just doing my duty.
I took the first step.
I love watching you play.
It is difficult to put what we have said into practice.
How long have you had a headache?

I did it with a heavy heart.
Come to the meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I fell asleep.

Did you see anyone there?
Sure! Sure!
Yeah, I lived there for many years.
My father's so old he can't work.
He got what he wanted.

I've had problems with solving this problem.
I don't know what's not good yet or just before, but more than once when I tried to log in to the site today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually look happy?
I went there of my own free will.
You think better when you close your eyes.
That's the absolute truth!
They really meant it.
Have you ever been here?
I want your opinion.
Do you really think I'm being selfish?
They're all here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
He's just a man.
I'm flexible.

I hope this never happens again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed for a few days.
Tom could be here.
It's a good thing I have a daughter.
Tom complains all the time.
I don't know if I'll have time.
I'll do anything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was only a matter of time.
Don't stare.
It should be able to change.
I'm happy.

I'm dyslexic.
You've helped me a lot.
What was I supposed to do?
The password is "Muiriel".
We went to the hippodrome. We went to the horse racetrack.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
One day you will understand.
I've been looking for you.
Tens of thousands of elephants are killed each year because of their ivory.
It just has to be that way.
I come when I can.
Don't stretch.
Not everything that shines is gold.
Are we all here?
The girl sees the boy.
That's great!
We need to focus on our virtues.
How fast!
The dog is mine.
He lived in Istanbul for years, speaks Turkish very well.
Goodbye!
She's never seen him.

Tom became a pleasurable man even though his parents wore it.
The whole house burned down.
I think we've met before.
I've been wrong before.
Can you tell us more?
Tom knows it's over.
That's treason.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
There's a mistake in the sentence.
You don't remember anything?
Are we ready to go?
Tom drinks a lot.
I'm not from around here.
That's a pretty big problem.
Tom was sitting on the grass under a coconut tree.
Everyone laughed.
I'm tougher than I look.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Can I go now?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Excuse me, who is this woman?
Do you have a copy?
Come and help me.
I barely got out of the house when it started raining.
Tom likes to be busy.
Good, as always.
First, first.
Tom's just lazy.
I'm a little depressed.
Does that mean you love me?
Does Tom eat fish?
The garage is rusty.
Check this out.
Mary is a married woman.
Is there any evidence?
You have to be strong!
It's never too late to learn.
I'd like to rent your cheapest car for a week.
Are you ready for more?
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Do you love me? he asked.
I told Tom you were in Australia.
Tom turned on the blinker.
Tom always makes me laugh.
She rarely, perhaps never, goes to bed before 11:00.
Are they all crazy?
What are you eating anyway?
It's not a problem.
Everything happens for a reason.
He's so weird.
There are four people in my family.
Are your tongues related?
That bag is mine.
I draw the line here.
Tom has all sorts of problems.
Pay attention to school rules.
Keep digging.
What school did you go to?
Several trees fell during a storm in our neighborhood.
Can I hear another one?
I'd rather starve than steal.
They all ran away.
I've already written to Tom.
Tom had to rewrite the song.
You want to get involved?
I knew I shouldn't get involved in your crazy business.
I'll be busy tomorrow.

He's good.

I'm not upset anymore.
Did Tom change his mind?
Get out of here.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
His younger brother is a famous footballer.
I've been too busy.
Would you rather speak English?
Get lost. Get lost.
I already ordered it.
What are you teaching?
How does it work?
Will we see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
That's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what it is.
He delayed his departure until tomorrow.
Tell him I'm innocent.
You're doing fine, just relax, be yourself.
I'd like to help.
It'd be hard.
She's cooking his meals.
Where did you learn English?
Beauty is in the eyes of the viewer.
How are you feeling today?
Tom needs a reason.
Okay, what's the secret?
I watched Tom die.
Are we starting soon?

I think it's gonna be a nice day.
I'm starving.
Naoko lives in the white house.
Tom's drinking beer.
Tom plays the piano very well.
He managed to escape in time.
I don't know anything about her.
You just got shot.
You're the reason I'm here.
Have you ever heard of anything like that?
I'm not rich enough.
Leanne has blue eyes.
Seniors have to pay for their hats and dresses.
Am I seeing things?
Don't move! Don't move!
It was all Tom's fault.
I've been training for months.
Did you bring a fan?
What was the plan, anyway?
You should be here at half past one.
Do you speak Chinese?
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.

I saw a hippopotamus at the zoo.
Aren't you from Australia?
It is the third largest city in Serbia.
I think about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
It's hers, isn't it?
She's making my life miserable.
I'm never home on Sundays.
Don't go out tonight.
Open fire! Open fire!
She's my teacher.
It's not easy to entertain Tom.
I told Tom to wait.
He's a man of his word.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke in two.
Please, hurry up.
Smoking is not allowed in any part of the restaurant.
They're digging a hole.
Muriel's 20 now.
Did you eat anything?
I'm at the post office.

In the attack!
Tom's gonna make it.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
The window is made of glass.
Are you done yet?
My knife is sharp.
Does Tom have a key?
Doctors are looking at the X-ray.
Don't talk.
Don't stop. Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
You'll be better in a few days.
That's what Tom would want us to do.
He tried to kill himself.
Tom said to ask you.
Everybody knows that.
She enjoyed yesterday's party.
Just tell me the truth.
The birds are singing.
Be careful: we write nationalities, days of the week and languages in capital letters in English.
I love watching you work.
Birds fly.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not bitter at all.
As far as we know, it's Tom's fault.
I love you, man.
Tom's a bookworm.
I've changed my mind.
The problem is, it's too expensive.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thinking beings, if only they got that chance.
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
Did Tom get the fatter end?
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
We like him.
That's a good answer.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
I don't need anything.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
He was running.
That's not the real thing.
Please write down everything I say.
Without pain, there is no science.
I wish you could sleep over.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're grilling.
I'm mad at you.
I thought you were married.
I'll find the money somehow.
I assumed you were busy.
He's not a scientist, but he's our friend.
I hear Tom's interested.
We need to move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like to eat garlic in the morning.
I think Tom is very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
Fish, please.
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Do you learn French at your school?
Come have a drink with me.
If I could understand, I would tell you so.
You're running.
I took the first step.
Stop yelling.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to the American Field Hospital.
We'll run in the park.
How far is it from here?
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you have read it?
Will you dance with me?
We have to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
We need more flour.
Tell me what he's saying here.
And Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I'm staying.
His way of talking annoys me.
I never thought about it that way.
I know Tom let you down.
He's always dissatisfied.
Tom was seriously injured.
My shirt isn't dry yet.
If you need any help, let me know.
I took the first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
The first one leaves at 17:30 and arrives at 20:25.
That was kind of weird.
Plants are growing.
Does Tom read and write Japanese?
Tom put the card on the table.
I called him.
It was all just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
Mom, I'm hungry.
I'm not going to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
That usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked my bike.
Here's a word from our sponsor.
I am not at all satisfied with the situation.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
Stay calm.
I'm armed.
Tom can't hold back.
Our eyes can't see infrared rays.
It's time to go to bed.
Tom is very intelligent.
Can I replace this?
He wanted to have a better cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring the hair dryer?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know the reason.
How are you feeling?
Everyone tells me I'm weird.
Bitcoin and ethereum are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you can think of can help.
Many predictions do not come true.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turned out to be true.
I'm so bitter.
Did you return the book to the library?
Fadil was trying to steal Dani's money.
Tom likes a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows all about the latest fashion trends.
He's a man with many talents.

We know her.
My dad doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
The accident happened around 3:00 a.m. on Sunday.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
It doesn't affect him at all.
I thought the food was great.
Fifty families live in this small village.
Tom is an activist in his community.
I'm deaf and dumb when I eat.
You look fat.
Learning a language is not easy.
Do you have a headache?
You have to learn English step by step.
Tom is better off now than he was before.
Tom and Mary are as different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for my opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he actually does not want to be fulfilled and it would be even wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of such desires is the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, a man would become completely sick of eternal life, and he would long for death
Water is liquid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't trust him.
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car on my own.

Tom and I just wrote a few books together.
I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
There's news.

They all paid.
You be careful.
Yogurt is made from milk and cream.
I'm all alone.
Good, how are you?
Do not drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
That was just the beginning.
The book is sold out.
The price of gold is changing every day.
Be nice.
Look around you!
Tom got married.
I could go with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
He's a scientist.
You are not allowed to enter this room.
Do you have time to come back tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is painting trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
Welcome back.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a commoner.
We can't go back.
I'm gonna take a shower.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Can anything be more romantic?
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
It's none of our business.
Do you like costumes?
Why do you ask?
I saw Markus' house.
At least he's honest.
It's really bad enough.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't be following us.
You too, Brutus?
The house where Ataturk was born in Thessaloniki.
People make mistakes.
It's snowing.
I thought you might need some help.
Does this make sense?

Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog is lying down.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
You taught us that.
No, no, no.
Go find something else to do.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
You're not gonna leave me, are you?
Don't exaggerate.
I can't approve this project.
You're texting Mary?
I'll save you a seat in the front row.
Mary pushes her children to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to give me my pen back.
Small flowers bloom at night.
I counted to 200.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
One day you should try.
I'm staying home with my grandparents for the weekend.
What's your conclusion?
I've been praying for you.
No, that's it.
Come to my house.
Tom's on the edge of his nerves.
The bathroom is upstairs.
Tomorrow is Christmas.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
Tom reads a lot.
It's just a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work in a hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In childhood, many violent criminals cruelly tortured animals.
I'm going to live in Cambodia.
How long will you be angry and yell at us?
Please, stop here.
How much does it really matter?
Shall we have an aperitif?
Tom keeps complaining.
If you want, I can teach you how to play the ukulele.
I've gotten used to it.
It's not that bad.
Looks like she was offended by what he said.
I love the music written by my friends.
Tom admitted it.
I've been there twice.
Actions speak more than words.
Is this where Tom sits?
That's enough!
It's hard working with you.
Tom's put on weight.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
It's my fault.
Don't answer that.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the pictures!
It is necessary to demolish several old houses.
What have you been doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.

I've never seen his face.
Tom's very considerate.
When are you going?
This report isn't very well written.
I want a new bike.
She said the government's latest move has multiple meanings.
They say love is blind.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
Tom didn't answer.
The five brothers worked together on the farm.
It could be a trick.
The company is known for its high quality products.
Don't forget to put sunscreen on yourself.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
Thank you for accepting my request for a friend on Facebook.
His hair covered almost his entire face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clear the snow off the roof?
I'll make it up to you.
Why is he here?
A student from Oslo who forged his diploma to enroll in college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Tom made a vegetarian chili.
I was trying to help you.
You've been really good to me.
I will finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'm gonna tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not the essay itself that's the problem, it's all these pernicious questions and explanations of words that are driving me crazy!
The weekend has arrived.
I'll be back next week.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
I really want to see her.
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was unbelievable.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
I wish you were there for me.
Here, try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
He started screaming.
I'll be there when I finish my homework.
Clean it up.
Can I use your vocabulary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people love chicken.
Is Tom out of his mind?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's take another look.
The last time I went to the beach, I was burned to death.
Pull back.

Are you suspicious of me?
Luckily, Tom wasn't seriously injured.
In general, children love sweets.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
You scared us.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
Tom decided to take the day off.
How could I resist?
Gold is heavier than water.
The phone is a wonderful device.
Tom is afraid of death.
I can't fix the car on my own.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not going into that.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
That's my question.
Hang in there, Tom.
Tom's definitely got the better end of it.
Just follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
There's no match for him.
There's nothing wrong with me.
Apparently, Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve. I was interested in languages then, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom a lot.
Tom won't run away.
I'd go.
I don't accept bribes.
Get down!
Tom couldn't stand it.
Anything you can think of can help.
You'll be better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the eye for people like you, but this is just miserable.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
And what if I'm a homosexual?
Either way, he'll definitely come.
Please leave this place as clean as you'd like to find it.
We'll get through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
That's all we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
That's your life.
- What's your name?
Understood, sir.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I'm crying.
I sympathize.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He'll be finished soon.
You learn by doing.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
The police are after me.
Did you see anyone there?
Either way, you're wrong.
They won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
No one said anything.
The book's on the table.
He is an aristocrat.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
We know.
Tom's going to graphic design school.
He lied to you.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always dissatisfied.
Music is his passion.
You should face the reality.
Light waves pass through space and various materials.
We managed to get out just in time.
I've had enough of it.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
Carthage must be destroyed!
How much does it cost?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We have some options.
It's supposed to work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't object to your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens.
Have some.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I'm starving from all this running.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of the word.
The spider tickles me.
Talk about others as you would like them to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
Seems OK to me.
Whatever you think?
You changed my life.
Somehow we'll get through the jungle.
Reaction is not always the best way to act.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who complain should be reimbursed with a proportional share of the annual remuneration with interest.
Tom's been buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory, it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me a picture of you.
That's my money, too.
It was, it's gone.
Tom's distracted.
Remember the name of the file before you try to recover the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only vodka from Russia is real Russian vodka!
I wasn't nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
I'm good at a lot of things.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of work.
He's always been a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Is it yours?
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom's been preparing for the exam?
A book that describes the wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You should not throw stones in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was silent for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He exhaled.
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd like to get involved.
You can't touch that.
Don't be shrewd.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everybody out.
Mary is a retired nurse.
I probably won't be watching TV tonight.
Did Tom pull the strings?
Give me all the money.
Mary was very supportive.
Those are nice shoes.
The girl sees the boy.
We also call Robert "Bob."

Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.
He didn't understand anything.

That's not the main question.
I was shocked by the news.
The girl eats bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you prefer tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not like that.
They know you.
I passed every test.
What are you going to do today?
What's on your mind?
I'm gonna kill you!
I was cold as a squirrel.
There is no point in just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right away.
Here's the key to my apartment.
It's an area with lots of new homes.
I can't believe all this.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
Yesterday it was snowing.
We were walking through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I wrote this song just for you.
His house, his free woman.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
Even if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Stop! Stop!
We studied all afternoon.
Are you going to send this as a mail order?
What do you suggest?
It is said that love is blind.
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Look out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
The room is dark.
Come on, give it to me.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
Slowly they moved forward.
Why is love so hard?
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
I'm late, aren't I?

Come and visit us soon.

I don't know if I'll have time.

A ticket, please.

Children are the flowers of our lives.
Why are we laughing?
A friend of mine lives behind God's feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
She shouted at him, but he didn’t hear her.
Water is life.
What are you going to do today?
He will probably win the championship.
After silence, what most accurately expresses the ineffable is music.
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
It's not over until it's over.
Tom still looks worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Where's the vodka?
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a hard day ahead of you.
That's good. That's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully satisfied.
Tom and Mary would make a wonderful couple.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Don't work too hard!
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was unbelievable.
People don't always act rationally.
I didn't even do that.
Did you pass the exams?
We're off the bus, we're gonna have to walk.
I'll set you free.
I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
How about we create a Facebook group so we can discuss learning foreign languages?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Are we in agreement?
It's not that bad.
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Quit smoking.
Tom went that way.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
Tom whispered something to Mary, and she smiled.
- But why?
May I see your map?
What's gonna happen now?
Be careful, the knife's very sharp.
They set up the library with new books.
It's clear.
How about some chocolate cheese?
It's your daughter's birthday today.
Will someone tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typo error.
Your book is twice the size of mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like to be.
Tom wouldn't be happy.
Tom has a nice garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my mind.
Do I have a knife?
It's pointless to have fun during your student life.
It just happened again.
It's christmas.
Tom has naughty hair.
I've seen enough so far.
I hate that one.
We'll miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're doing our best.
Tom will take a look.
Tom ate a sandwich.
Here's what I think.
I want to go.
I could go with you.
The cost of living is rising.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm just kidding.
Can you defuse a bomb?
I think Tom could do it.
I need five more minutes.
He sleeps like a baby.
I bet you know who told me that.

Tom's a little worried.
Tom is the best student in the class.
How is this your fault?
My phone number is 9876-5432.
Why don't you just tell Tom?
How did I overlook this?
This is a sentence.
Life is sweet.
That's my cat.

Mrs. Klein is in her 80s, but she's still very active.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming back.

We know enough.
I just want to eat something.

Does Tom have any experience?
I don't get it.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
How much is this umbrella?
I'm hot for her.
Tom did his homework in the kitchen.
I could kill you now.

He has an older brother, John.
I'd take it.

They'll know what to do.
Why didn't you say anything all the time?
He's undressed.
You've seen Leila's reaction.
I have a laptop.
Can I ask you a favor?
He's gone.

Mayuko avoided hard work.
She has short hair.
He drives a Pole.
My right hand is numb.
I don't know much about you.

You taught us that.
You can't talk to her.
You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy Mother's Day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
Everybody appreciates Henry.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does this happen often?
A little bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
I feel safe with you.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
The chairman opened the meeting.
It just wasn't our day.
It was raining.

This might hurt a little.
They can speak a little Spanish.
Finish this.

Could you get me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where have you been in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll study harder.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
Is the world unfair?
None of us ever saw Tom do that.
Do you love your mother?
I'm Tom's grandfather.
And you're wondering why we can't stand your company?
The more I know people, the more I admire dogs.
You spelled my name wrong.
You're different.
Tom can't stay.
You're embarrassing her.
I have two cats.
There were about a thousand people.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend didn't provide any support.
I had dinner with him.
I didn't care about that.
Some of them were and are still in constant danger because of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I don't think the internet is a place for kids.
That was annoying.
The teacher assigned me the longest chapter.
What do you think?
You were made for me.
He needs her.
It's obviously a typo.
Are we done yet?
Am I seeing things?
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom went to Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a trifling.
Control yourself.
I've been tired a lot, but I'm fine.
Butter is made from milk.
You tell her.
I'd take it.

Do you have trouble understanding what women or young children are showing you?
Looks like Cathy likes music.
He refused to comment.
Imagine yourself in my place.
Can you prove it?
We're doing our best.
I'm quitting.
I'm disappointed in you.
Tom looked furious.
Don't overreact.
Oh, yeah, I'll be busy tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
Excuse me.
I wasn't home all day yesterday.
I'd appreciate it if you stayed until tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.
He's everything, just not fair.
The bullet punctured the helmet.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think I'm doing very well in writing.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
Show me the picture!
That helps us a lot.
I filled the glass.
I'm not picky.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
That morning, Mary went around the village.
The rumor spread quickly.
Am I that different?
Tom took out the keys and opened the door.

I'm not worried at all.
It helps.
Dima slept with 25 men over the course of one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
We're just gonna follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we arriving soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This is making me very uncomfortable.
We're from Russia.
The cost will increase soon.
I work in a language school.
Was I really that happy?
Tom might have been the one who did it.
That sounds familiar.
It's always been that way.
I'll go to sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Deaf people can speak sign language.
Jane lay sick in bed.
I'm warning you!

What are you supposed to do?
Cows give milk.
Tom likes to drive.
I've been looking for you.
I'm a woman.
Everything matters.

Is that a yes or a no?

My car's in the garage.
Give me another example.

What would I do without you?
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really that happy?
I took off my wig.
I have no one but her.
You're reckless.
Tom won't be happy to hear that.
Tom is named after his father.
That's new.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm going to take a nap.
What was I supposed to do?
Stay away from my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?

I've seen Tom play a lot of times.
They work together.
You've tried.
The toy store is closed.
I'm taking you to the dance.
I'm a student.
This is my e-mail address.
Tom may be trying to convince Mary to do it.
She makes a mosquito elephant.
You told me not to lie.
He was a member of the social elite, rather than a representative of the masses.
I'm terrified.
You've tried.
His opinion is reasonable.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
Can you read that sign in front of us?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Take your time.
Give me a pen.
Your answer is incorrect.
Just tell Tom I called.
There is no answer to the question of what is best, because it is always individual and depends on the situation.

You're human.
I was ready for it.
Show me your papers.

I pulled an ace.
I'm the only one here who can do that.

What's your name again?
What a tragedy!
We're right here.
It's mine, not his.

I'm taking my car to town, so I can drop you off on the way.
This may not be enough.
The party's at Tom's house tonight.

Is this your suitcase?
They are Spanish villages.
This town isn't big enough for the two of us.
Tom paused for a moment.
Due to bad weather, the flight was delayed.
Investigate them.
I'm in better shape than you are.
I'm not that worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
Better a sparrow in the hand than a pigeon on the branch.
Do you have time to have lunch with me?
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I think it's possible to do that.
Tom thinks I don't know what he said.
I'm going to take a nap in about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
It's as hot today as it was yesterday.
He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test, before being sent for laboratory testing.

Look around.
Come to my house.
It's been a stressful day.
Her name is Lucifer.
Don't move! Don't move!
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom looked up close.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom doesn't speak French.
What's your job?
Let's continue the discussion.
How much do I get?
Who in the family wears pants?
What the fuck? !
Tom's undercover.
I want to be with you.
The unbelievers laughed at the bishop’s interpretation.

Check everyone.

The session is over.
I baked bread.
I've got a lot planned for tomorrow.

Why are you acting like a child?
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?

That's crystal clear.

I'm fascinated.
I'm as hungry as a wolf.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, that sentence caused a real mess.

He's wearing a gold chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of that.
Ataturk was born in Thessaloniki in 1881.
At least he's honest.
We took a lot of care of you.

It's hers, isn't it?
I want to answer the last question first.
Did you tell Tom this?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only five o'clock in the morning, and it's already light outside.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, a crossover with that will eventually happen.
Tom speaks French well.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
The sea blows everything!
Tom snapped.
I know this is weird.
Please, continue.
He never got over his son's death.
When are you leaving?
I'm just doing my duty.
Tom's gone to hell.
They all sat down.
If you don't have anything else to do, go to the Greek islands.
She's always wearing grumpy clothes.
Good always conquers evil.
Will that solve things soon?
I don't care what he says.
Mary put the ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to do that.
I'm really proud of Tom.

"I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in the things that people do I want to see scars, failure, mess, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I turned Tom down.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
The child continued to cry for hours.
I'd buy that one.
This goes beyond all boundaries.
I have a headache today.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
I want to go.
Apparently, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
French is his mother tongue.
Her words made him angry.
I was laughing.
It wasn't too hot.
I'm completely broke.
I almost forgot my passport.
I've been looking for you.
Tom reads a lot.
That's enough!
I hope you're not talking about me.
He who devours the sword, by the sword shall perish.
You're good to everyone.
I'm not usually this busy on Mondays.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom looked very confused.
I'm coming home tomorrow.
The teacher explained the meaning of the word.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
They did an unimaginable job.
He drank too much again.
Just tell Tom I called.

Tom, I need your help.
I brought you some coffee.
During his experiment on the power of observation, Tom could not describe any of the paintings on the wall of his living room, even though he had lived there for two years.
I've never seen Tom so busy.
Looks like you haven't been yourself lately.
She's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
I hope that's true.
I wonder whose sentence that is.
Tom was buying time.
Everyone held their breath.
Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember the name.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
That's not funny at all.
I called him.
How many calories does this sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
What did you like the most along the way?
I love watching you work.
Tom suggested that Mary go to the doctor.
I hope to visit Beijing as well.
I'm gonna go freshen up.
You're my inspiration.
This time I didn't want to comment on my dear friend.
I'm with you.
There's a Mr. Itoh here to see you.
You be careful.
She'll pay a maximum of $50.
Did someone call me?
We'll have lunch together at 1:30.
- What's his name?
I'm still a little tired.
I think I'm gonna shit myself.
I'm a vegetarian.
The picture is in this book.
To strive to maximize one's own self-interest, happiness, or security seems very natural to a human being.
I can do it as a joke.
I don't sing.
It's strange that no one knows the victim.
We're five minutes away.
I have a few gifts.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Translation is not as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit that.
That was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Over the past few days, I’ve been doing research on making money through the project, but I think all options will require a sudden change in my lifestyle, which is an awkward thing to do.
Is everything okay between us?
I've never camped.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the rings on the tree that we knocked down and found that it was thirty years old.
I'll see you later, Tom.
You want some fruit juice?
Let's set up a meeting.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still seems shaken.
I'm a very sad man.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people will like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
Come here, I want to show you something.
Remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
Well, that's interesting.
They're afraid of me.
Yesterday, I was happy.
You are my sun.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one was helping us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
She divorced her husband.
I'm right here.
I want to live in Brazil.
Get some help.
I didn't ask you not to.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
Mary is Tom's only daughter.
He still has no experience with this job.
Can you give us a hand?
Will you chill?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
I've changed my mind.
Based on the information I gave you, which story would you go out with?
Who can't be proud to be a Serb, with their highest historical achievements - the massacre of chiefs and genocides?
This makes it more uniform.
Do you know how to defuse a bomb?
Will you invite her to the party?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom's lost his temper.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
He's not missing anything.
Tom will take a look.
I wonder if someone could help me. I have a mobile phone that only shows an error message.
I'm amazed.
Everyone was smiling.
I miss him.
You should spend more time outside and less time inside.
Tom played on the strongest card.
He left his family and moved to Tahiti.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
You underestimate me.
What's your favorite YouTube video?
Millie listens to music.
The sea is green.
I don't have a guitar.
Will you report me?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
We're just getting started.
My friend can speak Hindi fluently.
Yeah, isn't that great?
Please, get out of the way.
I like Tom, but he doesn't like me.
Where can I find an office for tourists?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written part of the report.
I just finished it.
Talk about the wolf, and the wolf at the door.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
I have the impression that he knows a secret.
It was a little weird.
Tom's not gonna pass the exam.
Will you do that to me?
I really enjoyed it.
No one has died... yet.
In my beginning is my end.
Can we, humans, digest grass and extract nutrients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
How would you translate that?
It's almost 3:30.
We have three dogs, one black and one white.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Cheer up!
- Who's she?
I bought this yesterday.
The odds are against me.
I'm quitting.
The kids are playing outside.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Do what you want, I don't care.
She expects us to help her.
Who the hell are you?
Call me anytime, I always have a shoulder to cry on.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
Oh, that's good.
I'm not gonna strain you.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Thank you for coming!
What is your blood type?
Are we leaving soon?
I found a book for him.
They sell sugar in the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does it sometimes.
Do you have any news for me?
I'm thirsty.
It is our duty to help them.
He didn't do it on purpose.
Thank Tom for his help.
Simplicity is the highest level of refinement.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday to you!
The weather remains bad.
Photographs of nature and animals, taken in complete silence and tranquility, are real masterpieces.
My mother died the day I got married.
You want to meet her?
I'm never gonna mention this again.
We're out of food.
You're not allowed to enter that room.
You're the boss.
We've got two kids.
I think Tom's being careful.
Oh, no, no, no.
I forgot the baby monitor.
Tom's upstairs.
He's kind.
Just relax.
Smoking is prohibited in all restaurants.
You don't have to come to the office, take the day off.
The White family will arrive in Tokyo at 7:30 p.m.
What have you done to me?
Enjoy it.
Let me write your steps.
Tom's probably still in hiding.
This is the beginning of a new era.
Mary looks cute no matter what she's wearing.
Shit happens.
Look out!
He failed to provide any evidence to support his claim.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You don't even know his name, do you?
We don't need to look down on the poor.
You have a bad temper.
Is this your phone?
I was just on my way.
They divorced after their wedding anniversary.
This house was built by a famous architect.
He was taking care of the baby.
I bought this yesterday.
I've had a really bad day.
The whole country is talking about it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made an omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm naughty.
Yesterday, I was happy.
The way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Husbands and wives should help each other as long as they live.
All we need is water.
I wonder if Tom likes dancing as much as Mary.
What would you like to know?
Now's not the best time.
He's not a child anymore.
I'm trying to air the futon at least twice a week.
My education has made me who I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join?
Leave the book on the top shelf.
You stole my idea.
We could be happy here.
He is very educated.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
He got stiff again.
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You've tried.
Our yacht club has ten members.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Would you be able to do that?
Mom, that aunt and man are holding hands, they're really good friends, aren't they?
Can I walk you home?
I just saw Saudi Arabia's ambassador resign.
You be careful.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open it.
I've had some problems with solving this problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I have a brother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do it.
I have a few friends.
I have to look for her.
I can't wait.
I'll check.
Tom was shocked.
Just a moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom wants to know when you're done.
You call me back.
Tom still looks shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing to Tom right now.
That's the exception.
Tom came a little earlier than usual today.
Do you believe in eternal life?
I could eat a horse.
I've never actually met Tom.
Which is easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
Fadil wasn't in the house.
I've never noticed that before.
This is supposed to work.
Where have you been all afternoon?
What are you supposed to do?
I always liked Tom better.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train on his way to work.
I have house spirits.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're ridiculous.
Are Tom and Mary Really Married?
The horses sleep standing up.
Let me try the other one.
Take it easy.
I didn't do that either.
The stories of Snorri Sturluson tell, among other things, that Christianity in Norway was spread by violence.
Answer me right now.
Make yourself at home!
The students did not know how to respond.
Did you know that before?
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I that different?
I stumbled.
I assumed you were busy.
Since when have you been running?
This elegant gold-plated necklace with hearts is a necklace that will "shock your world".
Your answer is correct.
I love Leanne.
It all happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It was raining heavily.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm being selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Take some more.
You're being irrational.
I'm pissed.
Don't argue with me.
Dinner was held at the White House.
You should leave the planning to me.
You can avoid a lot of trouble if you just do it right the first time.
Mary jumped out of the window into the river.
She was crying.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
He asked her out on a date.
We all have to die.
Who are we? Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
The bill, please.
Broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables.
I'm terrified.
I'm doing great.
Can you enjoy this book?
The capital of Serbia is Belgrade.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Mary always walk hand in hand.
Don't worry, I'll translate it for you.
What did I do wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I've missed so many opportunities.
We heard her cry.
It helped me a lot.
You don't have to shout.
Give me another example.
Tom still has a little time.
We don't have a choice.
Baseball is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
She's violent right now, she should be avoided.
I was just stalling.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
Tell him I'm innocent.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
I'll visit him in a few weeks.
Italy is not Greece.
It's for my friend.
They don't speak English.
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go to see Tom?
- What's that?
He surrendered.
I can't wait forever.
This is the beginning of a new era.
America is a big, friendly dog in a small room, and every time he wags his tail, he knocks down a chair.
I don't have a ticket.
The doctor works in the hospital.
Nothing's happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You'll be famous.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Welcome to Tatoeba.
Everything is different.
What's your Bosnian name?
The truth must be told.
Look how much it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
Is your car blue?
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger ship than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
He lied to you.
How many mosques are there in Istanbul?
He was late because of the accident.
I always eat fruit and oatmeal for breakfast.
Do you think I'm a dictator?
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear he doesn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that the water quality be checked once a year in the pipes, twice in the well.
Dear God, it is really hard for people to have to draw your attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes or your appearance, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into a great void.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of dogs that bark.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written to Mary in a long time.
This story tells us interesting facts.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
You be careful.
Would you mind if I interrupted you just for a second?
I hate science.
The students did not know how to respond.
Do you have a book?
He has two cars.
If you don't bother them, they won't bother you.
Good intentions are important.
I've already thought about it.
Men remain children all their lives.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Come on, admit it.
The two of us are so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just taking a look.
Where is the beach?
You want to know something specific?
You're welcome.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired. I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I'm not sure.
Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students were in attendance.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
That can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
Oh, that's good.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why'd you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters think Maria is the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom won't vote in this election.
I bought some flowers.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
She's back from the hospital.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What's gonna happen now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Make room.
He is also very well known in Australia.
Somebody called.
You be careful.
Winter is a time of snow.
Under what name?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes, they may come true.
Tom is a third-year student.
Who's going to come with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
The way it came, the way it went.
Give him some time.
Whoever waits, waits.
I'll have to say, yes.
We've never been apart.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
The doctor examined her thoroughly.
At that moment, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91% of the Norwegian population is supplied with potable water from surface sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What's she drinking?
These are artificial tears.
Tom is very rude.
Don't forget to write the date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clean up this mess.
Could you have read that?
Try it again.
That's perfectly normal.
How's your life going?
A new restaurant has been built.
The price of this book is $5.
I want a sword like this.
Can you keep secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
Move quietly.
When the fire broke out, he was asleep.
My older sister sings well.
I never thought of that.
A childhood illness blinded her.
Some friends can't be replaced.
Although the existence of this phenomenon is mere speculation, it is possible that in the future there will be evidence to support it.
Quiet down there.
Tom explained in detail, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want to eat some cheese.
He wouldn't like that.
I will have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom's double-parked.
Can you speak Latin?
Will you help me?
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back here.
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to the protection of moral and material interests arising from any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is the author.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands at sea.
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
Tom is hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went out for a walk.
Is there any other option?
The amount for the work done and the interest in the invested capital was several million.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
I'm the one who pays.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't fully agree with you.
It's a beautiful day.
Are you saving this place for someone?
How are you these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think we women have an extra sense.
Sunday has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
Croatia is a country in the southeastern part of Europe.
I'll be back late.
You're a little liar.
The sea has risen, the sea of men.
I will send a letter to my brother who lives in Sapporo.
The politician had sticky fingers, because 5% of each contract ended up in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought that was my job.
I'm a teacher.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He hasn't even heard that Tom hates us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I've written a letter to anyone.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't fight.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he didn't have a choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
American English is no better than British English.
Tom works about nine hours a day.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom was saying.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'm gonna take a shower.
I'm happy. I'm happy.
It's mine, it's not his.
We have four French lessons every week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Fadil demanded that Dani give him money.
Sami is our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
He broke into my home.
The bathroom is upstairs.
She took care of her son.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It is a typical Gothic church.
It was a good presentation for the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Is this your notebook?
Somehow we survived.
Tom hasn't been practicing.
Thank you very much!
Keep the change.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom give up?
Europeans gained an advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
It seemed to me that Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to do.
I will pray for your family.
Tom chased the flies away.
He abruptly stopped smoking.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know it.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to refute what had been said.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The cup's on the table.
That makes me very angry.
Is there still light out there?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Don't you agree?
Would you like me to take a look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very kind of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what does it matter to you?
I wish I'd thought of that.
I drink milk.
He managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw a cat.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw a cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom gets back safe.
I have no idea what was going on in his head to turn down such a favorable suggestion.
I just got up.
How does it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You've tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Whoa! Whoa!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom's tough or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate hot dogs with potato salad.
Come alone.
To be a good kid, you need to go to bed and get up early.
Good, how are you?
I'm thinking of going abroad.
I didn't tell you to do that.
- Where are you from?
I made a promise.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not an easy sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a lezilebovic.
This is how it was supposed to be.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like to work.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks bleak for Edmond Dantes, who, after becoming a victim of a conspiracy, is convicted of treason and sent to life in prison.
You're being irrational.
My French is bullshit.
We survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like to be.
It stinks.
Can you let Tom know I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Do you know how to cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak point.
You're one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
One foot in the grave.
Tom just told me the opposite.
Louder!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm compassionate.
Tom is dissatisfied.
That would be a pleasure.
It's crazy as electricity.
I'm sorry I didn't respond to your letter earlier.
Do not drink water from a dirty glass!
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today were written by me.
That doesn't scare me at all.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Somebody's here.
She asked me if I had slept last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's her picture.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Who's your favorite wrestler?
It's nice to meet you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
This place looks very different from what it used to be.
Is it yours?
Why Are Rabbit Ears Big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
Souls don't exist.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's a real idiot.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to do things on the go.
You're working too hard.
This one's really cool.
Not a word to anyone.
I really enjoyed it.
You can trust it to some extent.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Keda.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry, I'm late for the meeting.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I tried it at all.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this piece.
It's five o'clock in the morning in Brazil.
Tom hinted that Mary would do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's really cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
- Who's she?
Tom was arrested three times.
This isn't that much fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she would reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
You don't learn that in school.
Is it clear?
I don't want to go out tonight.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Fish cannot live outside the water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop resisting! Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy, I can't help you.
I have two colors.
Move! Move!
Please, wait a little longer.
I won't do it!
I'm tired of arguing.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
Good job!
Yeah, I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom might be able to pull himself up.
I just want to get away.
Dania continued to follow Fadil’s example.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day, Bill goes fishing.
Don't let a chance like this slip away from you.
What time do you have breakfast?
You be careful.
He's in his first year of college.
I looked for grape juice.
I was thinking of my family.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Due to bad weather, the flight was delayed.
Can I have your vocabulary?
My fluent knowledge of the language is sufficient for many situations, but not for expressing my, often contradictory, emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a teacher.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom is a nerd.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbeat.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know this girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
Show me the photos!
She wanted to become a nurse.
I'm sorry to bother you all the time.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
That's great!
I'm tickled.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it on time?
It's funny the postman hasn't come yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How do we stop that from happening?
His novels are a favorite among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'm about to buy a boat, what kind of insurance should I choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not American, he's English.
How do you say “thank you” in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
You ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right upstairs.
We've got to get going.
Tom's a mechanic.
His misfortune taught me a lot.
Are we ready to go?
Why? Why?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Tom is a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the internet.
She tried it.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom isn't sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote many musical works for the bassoon.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry broke his right femur in a cycling accident in France on Sunday.
Where there are many grandmothers, there are many children.
Tom's tight as a string.
Never lose hope.
Sounds simple, I know.
It was just the whipped cream on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom looked very confused.
The results were unbelievable.
Choose one.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes squeaked.
Are you fully recovered?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job was already done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She drinks like a scumbag.
Don't move!
The incident was filmed by an observer.
Did I drop that?
Are you happy?
This is the dumbest thing I've ever said.
I wish I'd known Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man by his looks.
It's useless.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the left side is in New York.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is famous for its luxurious dishes, this year will be a little more modest.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
Italy is a beautiful country.
What's the matter with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
Violent criminals were often bullies in childhood.
I want you to introduce me to Tom.
After a long discussion, I ended up doing things at random.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man of words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house for dinner yesterday.
Look at the size of it!
It's the truth.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a good time to buy one.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom came out of it.
Tom was interfering with people he should never have interfered with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write it.
Tom is ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
It's a problem you have to solve yourself.
I was exaggerating.
Termites eat trees.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This is supposed to work.
You've let me down.
You shouldn't judge a man by his appearance.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the email!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They're giving speeches tomorrow.
- What's this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
A team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
So do I.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie to me.
What are your plans, then?
The kids are asleep.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
This small town, like many small towns in England, has a fairly long history.
Tom closed the door.
I didn't have fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and spent a lot of money.
I don't like to socialize.
Tom is alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
That smells delicious.
The first phase is completed.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even more.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She takes care of her old mother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought a dozen pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French taught at your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna get better.
It's important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
You tell her.
I volunteered.
I can't tell the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to no one liking me.
The brakes squeaked.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Just like a bean.
I'm a little worried right now.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite a song he wrote when he was thirteen.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom leave?
You be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do that.
Where did you get that idea?
- What are you talking about?
It was a difficult decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
A lot of people admire him.
I hope the weather will be nice tomorrow.
Mary snorted.
Let's sit down.
Come and have a look.
Tom really looks familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I'm quitting.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom saved all the letters Mary sent him.
Go swim a little with Tom.
He's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A woman's chiffon is not complete without a little black dress.
I can't sit still.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the toilet here?
Happy Easter!
Tom helped me save a few bucks by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
I owe you an apology.
There's nothing you can do but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's worked his whole life.
Die! Die!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom.
My watch needs to be repaired.
Tom will live.
Please read between the lines.
You win!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'm gonna be late.
I had lunch in a hurry.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave a message for Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
I want to want what you want.
Health is wealth.
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he never came on time.
Sweet dreams!
Somebody needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a stone.
Can I call you back in 20 minutes?
Wind is an inexpensive and clean energy source.
As little as we know about her origins, at least we can be sure that she's the pilot of the Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
A deer is faster than a stronger one.
People used to write books with typewriters.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
That's the bathroom.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Mary learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope that's not the case.
Give me one example.
How could I hate Tom?
You're wearing this.
How barbaric!
What day is tomorrow?
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I look forward to your letter.
When the cat's gone, the mice run round the water.
We need that from Tom.
Japan is ruled by an emperor and Spain by a king.
It's Alice's book.
Will we see Tom again?
The world was on the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie drinks milk.
Where did you see Tom?
It's all quiet again.
I'm engaged.
Can we order, please?
What does he do?
By the way, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They laughed at me.
I'm pissed.
Take it easy, Tom.
Can you give an example?
I don't intend to go to Bust with you this weekend.
He stole a very precious diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom drinks like a suck.
Just like the good old days.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't exaggerate.
Look at that.
We have your size, but not in that color.
That's not like you.
He's always here between 5:00 and 6:00.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hope I can do that.
I don't like stubborn people.
Sitting around all day is bad for you.
The rainy season starts in June.
You always do.
That's perfectly normal.
You're out of luck, Tom.
The wall looked smooth and impenetrable.
Do you hear anything?
He has two cars.
Tom's still going to be angry.
He greeted us and left.
Welcome to Tatoeba.
I see, but I don't see.
I'm bleeding.
I'm glad you answered.
We're close friends.

He put his thoughts on paper.
I'm a beginner.
I've gotten used to it.
Listening to music is my favorite way to relax.
I wasn't involved in the conversation.
Tom got on the bus.
You've been very quiet.
With freedom comes responsibility.
Catch him.
Let's go.
What's your favorite type of sushi?
Come see me after work.
How did I miss this?
That boy talks like an adult.
You're staring at TV again instead of doing your homework!
Cows eat grass.
I need a haircut.
He has redeemed himself for his mistakes.
I think I'll be back in about 30 minutes.
Have you ever wanted to live on an island?
No one cares why Tom is a vegetarian.
Tom's pretty mysterious.
Did you eat anything?
Tom's easy to scare.
I'll try everything one day.
Tom taught me how to read.
There's a math test tomorrow.
Don't let a chance like this slip away.
Laughter is contagious.
They sell fish and meat.
That's exactly how it was.
I recognized him at first sight.
I've never worn a nightgown in my life.
We'd better get ready.

I'm sorry, the connection is still busy.
Tom just told me the opposite.
She has one son and two daughters.
Here's your bag.
You're the boss.
He took Jane out to dinner.
Who broke the cup?
You're wasting your time.
What Tom said can't be applied to this situation.
There are several reasons.
What are you going to do from now on?
I'm really proud of that.
Stop worrying so much.
What's the matter with you?
I like grapes.
What are you supposed to do?
I didn't care.
He's back from Canada.
"You talk too much," he said.
I'm really happy about that.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
We missed Tom so much.
I'm not ashamed of that.
They'll know what to do.
We didn't make it.
Wind is an inexpensive and clean energy source
I got off the train.
You promised you'd help me.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I feel good now.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
She can't stop us.
You're saying you deliberately hid your good side?
He's not the one who drank all the milk.
I don't fall for that.
You tell him.
Do you speak English?
He was bare-breasted and bare-headed.
Everyone says I look like my dad.
Come early so we can talk about plans.
Tom, do you prefer dogs or cats?
Tom can't play guitar.
He looks young for his age.
I don't know why I have a headache.
Let's do somebody a favor.
I will always remember your advice.
He cheated on his biology exam.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
He's crazy about Mary.
With the money he inherited from his grandfather, he bought an engagement ring for Mary.

You take care of yourself.
Me and all my brothers share a room.
Layla immediately began to cry.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Looks like that diamond is real.
Learning all these sentences by heart is out of the question.
What have you done now?
I'm sure you can do that.
You can't go in that room.
How old are you really?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You tried.
Tom decided to sell the car.
Who the hell are you?
There was a new snow avalanche on the road in Ejeskaret in Oda municipality in Hordaland on Tuesday evening and it is not known if anyone was trapped in the avalanche.
Are you a Uyghur?
I'm claustrophobic.
I can't fix the car on my own.
Zip!
Please, hurry up.
Tom nodded his head.
Should we tell anyone?
He was flooded by the cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom thought.
Don't be mad.
His memory loss is more a mental problem than a physical one.
He exhaled.
He started screaming.
As it came, so it went.
It's not as bad as it looks.
I'm mad at Tom.
Tom could have been better.
She lives a happy life with her husband near the sea in Kamakura.
Tom's gotten fat.
A spider took your car.
So what if it's true?
He was ahead of his time.
Don't fight back.
Do you speak Greek?
It meant a lot to me.
The effect was very different from what we intended.
A fish, please.
Aren't you done yet?
I'll have to think about it,
Tom was talking about music.
Everything has a price.
It was warm yesterday.
There were so many people on the train, I had to stand.
Are you a Uighur?
Curiosity killed the cat.
Why do people go to the cinema?
I don't have homework today.
Tom and Mary get along very well.
When can Tom come home?
Did you do it on purpose?
I can see the reflection of my face in the window.
Go talk to Tom.
Make up your mind.
There's no use trying to persuade him.
I meant my family.
You could have spared me coming just to tell me I shouldn't have been here today.
This will make it a lot easier for us.
How's the weather in New York?
I've been gone too long.
Is it true you're going to study in Boston?
Tell me where you live.
Let's go over it again.
No matter what you do, don't leave the board in the toilet.
Will we see Tom again?
Start now.
I have no intention of answering all the questions.
You'll have to ask Tom.
That should save us some money.
He worked ten hours a day.
This one's pretty cool.
That publishing company is solvent.
Choose one.
How'd you find out where Tom was?
Stop looking for a prince on a white horse, they don't exist.
It's his, isn't it?
He'll probably still be angry.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
I'm too old for this.
I don't fall for that.
That's a fake, isn't it?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Will we see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.
I want my dream to come true.

I went to see my parents.
You know I don't like eggs.
I burned my tongue.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Are you done?
The first step is the hardest.
Mary read the entire 321-page manual in her breath.
I'm thirsty.
How old is this plane?
I want to get married.
I just got here.
I went to church this morning.
What eye hurts?
Tom's not as smart as he thinks he is.
Why should I listen to you?
That never dared to happen.
I'm gonna drop out of school.
- How old are you?
What kind of movie is this?
Did I drop that?
Turn to the right.
It would take me forever to explain everything.
I haven't worked for many years.
What a beautiful house!
I haven't forgotten him.
Can you take me home?
What's on your mind?
It's getting dark.
Don't get in the way of Tom.
I really like to exercise.

Now that's enough!
I like grapes.
I bought a lot of things.
When is your birthday?
I'm devastated.
I assumed you were busy.
- It's clear.
Keep digging.
What's all the fuss?
Tom's confidence was shattered when his boss took him down in front of his colleagues.
I'm not worried at all.
We've got a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that to me?
I probably won't be watching this.
Stop worrying.
Come on in.
Did I call you?
Most people are afraid to set a great goal for themselves, for fear that they will never achieve it.

Where are they headed?
Does Tom know about this?
What do I tell them?
I went into her room.
I can't sleep at all.
They couldn't do it in the second half.
Just give him some time.
How did I get here?
He's studying hard.
It takes a lot of imagination when trying to add a new sentence here.

He came to see you yesterday.

Tom's a petty guy, isn't he?
Better a kiss in the woods than ten in the hand.

Before this decision comes into effect, no one will move a finger to resolve this.
Do you have anything to report?
I've always hated doing that.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known that Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Move quietly.
I'm happy.
I miss talking to Sally.
Tom's gonna talk.
They were all young once.
It wasn't easy.
Goodbye!
He's speeding up.
Things changed after that.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't go too far.
Oh, look at that.
It's become a habit for me to do that.
It's not the right choice.
It didn't hurt.
I like the bread.
Be yourself.
It's all in the report.
