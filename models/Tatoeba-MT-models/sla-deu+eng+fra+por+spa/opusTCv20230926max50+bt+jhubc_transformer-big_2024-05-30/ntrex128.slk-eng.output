Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will "look like fools"
Some Members of the National Assembly were alarmed by the proposal to change their title to “MWP” (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal was made in connection with the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties fear that this could bring ridicule.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that "the abbreviation rhymes with the words twp and pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means silly and "pwp" means poop.
A Welsh MP said the party as a whole was "dissatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said that his party is approaching the change of the name "liberal", but noted that from the abbreviation MWP is not far from the word "muppet" (English puppet, stupid).
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u".
The Assembly's Commission is currently working on a draft law that will bring changes to the names, stating: "Of course, the final decision on the possible designation of members of the Assembly will be the responsibility of the Members themselves."
The Wales Administration Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the debate on the proposals with the public, and the results showed that there was broad support for the change of the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
As regards the designation of members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the name "Walesian Parliament Members" (WMP), but the MWP option gained the most support in the public debate.
Obviously, Members of the Assembly are trying to propose alternative options, but the problem may be to reach an agreement, especially for President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a draft amendment bill within a few weeks.
The reform laws will also include further changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the exclusion of Members and the drafting of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of their designation when they debate the laws.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "North Macedonian Republic".
The popular vote was announced in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Greece has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour expresses a claim to Greek territory and has therefore repeatedly objected to the country's applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who is opposed to a plebiscite to change the name, said he would ignore the vote.
But proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price a country has to pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church have ceased due to the problems of the churches in Harlem.
“The old people I’ve talked to claim that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
“Today there is neither one nor the other.”
In his opinion, the loss of bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently nowadays,” he says.
“A bar is no longer a living room where people from the neighborhood meet regularly.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leaders think, “and sooner or later it will be back at the beginning.”
Churches could be printed out by rented houses, with residential areas filled by people who will not support the remaining temples in the area.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says. “The day is approaching when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of the people coming to these neighborhoods will belong to these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the capital of the black population. The Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original White Congregation of Methodists moved in the 1930s.
The building was claimed by a black congregation that carried out devotions nearby.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, a central figure in the boycott of retailers on 125th Street (Harlem's most important shopping street), who refused to hire and support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners had the bell tower built as part of plans to rebuild the church.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bell the “bells of the poor.”
The specialist, who played the bell game in July, called it a “cultural treasure” and an “irreplaceable historical instrument”.
This specialist is Tiffany Ngo from the University of Michigan, who also noted that it was the first bell tower in the world played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind. He began playing a larger bell tower at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's Church.
During the last few months, a complex story of architects and contractors took place in the Church of St. Martin. Some were brought by secular leaders of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish administration, which consists of secular leaders and manages the parish, wrote in July that it feared the diocese would “leave the cost” to the parish administration, despite the parish administration not being involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency regarding the procedure of the diocese.
13-Year-Old Boy Hunting Lobster in California Injured by Shark
Authorities said a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while hunting a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was thrilled that he had caught a lobster, but then “he found the boy screaming, ‘Something has bit me!
I got a bite!’
He had a completely torn collarbone," Hammel said, which was the first thing he noticed when he reached the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was airlifted to San Diego's Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark attacked is unknown.
Coast Guard captain Larry Giles said at a briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to the Swami's area in Encinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to invest in cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's wants to create lanes with cosmetics in the style of department stores, competing with the chain of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams. Specialized assistants will be available.
This is a significant investment of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn in the UK cosmetics market, which is growing steadily while sales in fashion and household goods are declining. As part of the investment, larger aisles with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country. If this move is successful, they will be taken next year
The cosmetics investment comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the shelf space that once belonged to televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its cosmetics range to 3,000 products, with Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw being available for the first time.
The current L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees product lines will be given more space, as there will be places reserved for brands just like in Boots stores, for example.
In addition, the supermarket re-launches its range of Boutique makeup so that most of the products are also available to vegans, as it is increasingly demanded by young customers.
In addition, fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores. The first store opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open by the end of the year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the trend of buying a small amount of food every day at local grocery stores mean that supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said that stores will increasingly resemble department stores. His supermarket chain is trying to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and other than food goods.
Sainsbury's incorporated Argos stores into hundreds of stores and also integrated several Habitat stores. Both chains were bought by the company two years ago. According to its representatives, with this step, food sales increased, making acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to innovate the department with cosmetics and medicines ended in failure.
After 2000, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots chain, but the merger ended a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy proceeds in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its medical business with 281 stores to Celesio three years ago. This company owns LloydsPharmacy and its sales value was <0xC2><0xA3>125m.
The company said Lloyds will play an important role as a broader range of premium skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, will be added in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and style of the cosmetics lanes to make our customers shop in a more welcoming environment.
In addition, we have invested in special training of colleagues who will be at hand and ready to help.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all requirements. The impressive environment and practical locations mean that we have become a significant destination in the field of cosmetics, which is an innovation of traditional shopping."
Peter Jones is “exasperated” that Holly Willoughby has terminated her <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract.
Peter Jones's Dragons' Day star has been "exasperated" that television presenter Holly Willoughby has terminated an <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Truly brand of interior accessories and accessories.
The pair’s business was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was quitting.
Holly Willoughby stirred up the star of the show Dragons' Day, Peter Jones, because at the last moment she was pulling out of a joint lucrative store with a brand of lifestyle products, so that she could focus on her own new mega-contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "raging" when the TV's golden girl during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire's headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that the new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant he would no longer have enough time to devote to their brand of interior accessories and accessories.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew out of Britain and headed to one of his vacation homes.
One source said: “The Truly project was clearly Holly’s number one priority.
It was to be her long-term future, securing it for decades to come.
Her decision to leave was absolutely shocking.
On Tuesday, no one understood what was happening. The launch was so close.
At the headquarters in Marlowe, a warehouse is full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of the show This Morning, which belongs to the most lucrative stars of Britain, can cost the company millions. The reason is huge investments in products from pillows and candles to clothes and home accessories, but also the possibility of further delay in the launch of the market.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby proposed the Truly project with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, became director in March.
The two couples spend their vacations together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Ante McPartlin, host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on business matters.”
It was a tough conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism that awaits him from the media for his remark. Some will consider her “unworthy of the president” and will blame him for speaking so positively about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump responded with his ridiculous “moderator” voice.
“I didn’t make any promises.”
He noted that after the initial joint meeting in June in Singapore, Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump celebrated the first meeting as a big step on the way to the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
Negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have stalled.
MOSCOW (Reuters) - More than three months after a summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Jong-ho, told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “appropriate response” from the U.S. to North Korea’s first disarmament steps.
Instead, the United States continues to impose sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech before the meeting.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - ending missile tests, releasing hostages and returning the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended the unusual way he talks about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to talk like a president, but then there wouldn’t be 10,000 people out there trying their best to get in, instead there would be 200 people out there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated one of the islands and killed hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to leave their homes, a nationwide disaster was not declared, a prerequisite for obtaining international assistance.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it’s a bit complicated,” Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palo, it is not yet certain that foreign workers will be able to operate in the field.
National Disaster Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palo to see if international agencies would be allowed to participate in ancillary work.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly facing, the country's preparedness for the wrath of nature is pitiful.
In Aceh, shelters from tsunamis are built, but they are not common on other coasts.
The large number of deaths likely contributed to the apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Pal, despite the fact that it was an active warning.
Even under favorable conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was on Lombok to provide care to earthquake victims, is headed to Pal, but it will take at least three days to get to the site of another disaster.
President Joko Widodo set up his election campaign to improve Indonesia's wretched infrastructure, spending heavily on roads and railways.
Widodo’s administration, however, is plagued by a lack of funding, with elections awaiting him again next year.
In addition, Widodo faces pressure from persistent religious tensions in Indonesia, as the Muslim-majority followers have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
During the fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets, more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes. Gangs used machetes, bows and arrows and other raw weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool from a distance matched against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal. His team lost 1-0 at that time.
He rolled the ball to the left and shot a shot at the farther girder.
His attempt sailed high above the penalty area and headed towards the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball finally fell through the striking Kepu Arrizabalag into the net.
“I was just trying to get into that position, to get to the ball, players like Shaq are always trying to play as forward as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I made one touch. I didn't think much about it and I fired."
Chelsea took the lead in the half 1-0. In the 25th minute, the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored for her.
The Blues striker returned the pass to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> before this goal, turned in the middle of the field and sprinted to half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> showed a quick hint in the middle of the field.
Then he sent out a beautiful crossing pass, which he and Hazard took to the penalty area.
The gambler overtook the defenders and ended to a farther pole when he shot left over Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool are waiting for the match against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League. The match starts on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will fight Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
According to reports, many people were trapped in the debris of buildings destroyed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5, which occurred on Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman who was sentenced to death.
A murder investigation began this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging people in the area who have seen or heard something to come and testify.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “Investigation is in the early stages, but I call on everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers who have recorded anything using the onboard camera, to contact us as they may have key information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside the property.
Friends who believe they know the woman came to the scene this afternoon to find out where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police said they are currently informing the victim's family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed inside or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to say anything.
Homeowners are now learning that they will be inside again in a few hours.
One of the officers heard him tell another man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
He keeps saying, "It's so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon, another van was outside.
Several police officers were standing in the cordon watching the panel house.
Police are asking anyone with information to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 with a reference to protocol 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in front of parliament is the most recent monument to the dispute over "rewriting history"
Its removal would be a satisfaction for his fanatical puritanical adherents such as the Taliban having destroyed so many English cultural and religious artifacts.
Cromwell’s company, however, called Crick’s proposal “foolish” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Company, said: “In the current discussion of removing the statues, it was self-evident that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside Westminster Palace would become one of the targets.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps he would have sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent realization of Cromwell by Sir William Ham Thornycroft testifies to his perceptions in the 19th century and is part of the history of a personality that, according to many, still deserves respect.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, to be the protector of parliament against outside forces, in his case, of course, the protector of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate description of the reality, historians continue to debate.
However, it is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique personality who embodies one side of this dispute.
The achievements he has achieved as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and respect.”
A deadly pig kills a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southeastern China.
A man identified only by the surname Yuan was found dead with a ruptured artery and blood drained near a market in Liu Phan Shui Prefecture in Kuizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing the vaccine at a pox farm in Xining Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
On Wednesday, he reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door of the side barn open.
He said there was a large male pig in the barn with a bloody muzzle.
According to the report, the forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-pound hog had crushed the farmer to death.
“The cousin had bloody and crushed legs,” said a cousin named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
According to security camera footage, Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager for Evening News said the pig was separated so as not to attack anyone else while police at the scene were gathering evidence.
Yuan's family and market representatives are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although attacks by pigs on humans are rare, they have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing a man critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kilogram pig had pushed a Welsh farmer against a tractor until his wife managed to scare the animal away.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They are just playful.
Shantia, they're curious... they don't intend to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them the proper respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains to many places in the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the coming days, dew will bring heavy rains in the north of Mexico and in the southwest of the United States.
Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h at 5:00 a.m. (East American time) on Sunday, a category 1 hurricane, 620 km southwest of the Mexican outcrop of Punta Eugenia.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Over the Pacific Ocean, meanwhile, a trough began to form, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 25 centimeters of rainfall on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Tropical humidity then combined with the approaching trough will form in the coming days in the southwest extensive and dense rain.
In some places, 2 to 10 centimeters of rainfall fall, causing severe dangerous flooding, flooding of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rain, during which a point falls 5 to 8 millimeters of rain per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas in the southwest, especially over much of Arizona, rainfall is expected from 5 to 10 centimeters.
Severe floods can occur because conditions deteriorate rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
In view of the threat of tropical rains, it would be extremely unreasonable to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can cause rivers to rage in the canyons, with thunderstorms locally bringing violent winds with dust in the air.
An approaching trough in some parts of the southern California coast will cause heavy local rainfall.
More than 13 millimeters of rainfall can fall, which could cause debris floating and road viscosity to a lesser extent.
This would be the first rainfall in the area during its rainy season.
On Sunday evening and early Monday morning, scattered rains from the tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona. On Monday evening and Tuesday, the rain will be widespread.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, there may be significant temperature fluctuations throughout the US, as the Arctic is cooling while the tropical zone remains relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes over a short distance.
A great example of a sharp change in temperature is the center of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees.
Over the next few days, he will again try to transplant and spread the persistent summer heat.
In the center and east of the United States, a warm beginning of October is expected in many places. In several territories from the South Mountains to parts of the Northeast, the temperature will exceed 26 degrees.
It could be 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the US throughout the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh’s interview was followed by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks on Thursday the impressive testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault. The attack on Christine Blasey-Ford allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, a political stalemate persisted, with radio and television stations interrupting broadcasts at the last minute for a turnaround: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake secured a deal under which the FBI could investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh caught her drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, who spoke passionately, said he was 100 percent sure it hadn’t happened.
It is likely that the broadcast was watched by more than 20.4 million viewers announced by Nielsen on Friday.
The company counted the average ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks that broadcast the broadcast, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring audiences in offices.
For comparison – a similar number of viewers watch the playoffs of American football or the passing of the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-forming moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long interview, according to Nielsen, the most of all networks.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was high even after the hearing.
The main character of Friday's drama was Flake.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, screaming at him as he tried to take the elevator to the Judicial Committee for questioning.
For a few minutes he stood with his eyes down and listened to the remorse broadcast live by CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," one of the women said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
Someone said to him, “You have great power, but many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement, adding that he would say more at the committee hearing before the elevator closed.
All the cable and other networks continued to deal with the matter live hours later, when the Judicial Committee was due to vote on whether to forward Kavanaugh’s nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the nominee over the next week, as urged by minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who is his friend.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had great power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing political games' over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticised her intention to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends a meeting of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, alongside her on the front page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her Brexit plan, which is likened to a lady’s game. He said the proposal for Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other was “completely absurd”.
Shooting at Wayde Sims: police in connection with the death of the LSU player arrested the suspect Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested a suspect who allegedly shot and killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of a quarrel between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
Police seized the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the WAFB, a partner of the CBS network.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had admitted to shooting Sims.
According to the lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The coroner's office in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for their "efforts and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198-centimeter-high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for the LSU.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "shocked" by Sims' death.
"You're always worried about this," Wade said.
Volcano spills ash on Mexico City
Ash, which rolls from the volcano Popocatepetl, reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to avoid the volcano, after activity increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered in 24 hours.
The area has experienced noise and disturbances several times.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the glass of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with law enforcement, and thousands more took part in parallel demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the Catalan secession vote, which divides society.
A group of masked separatists was stopped by police, throwing eggs and powder paint, and the streets, which are sometimes crowded with tourists, were filled with dark clouds of dust.
Later in the day, police used batons to bring the fighters under control.
Over the course of several hours, groups of pro-independence supporters chanting "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
According to local press reports, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after Madrid declared the 1 October referendum illegal, tensions persist in the region's independence-seeking region, but the Catalan separatists have been celebrating it.
A large majority of voters voted for independence, but participation was low, as opponents of the split largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police in violent clashes tried to prevent the continuation of voting in polling stations throughout the area.
Groups of pro-independence activists camped outside on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it had to go in a different direction.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer believes Catalonia will achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“My parents were crying over the happiness of being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” she says.
Although Catalan political parties demanding independence in regional elections in December last year achieved a close (but important) victory, this year they are no longer able to continue successfully. Many of their most famous leaders went into exile themselves or are waiting in custody for a trial for their part.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming a protest in support of police by phone, says politicians on both sides have contributed to the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government is showing us,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for hitting their car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
In addition, there may have been a gunshot to the car from a crossbow.
Meng's goal marked Livingston's victory over the Rangers 1-0
Dolly Menga wins first goal for Livingston
Newcomer Livingston shocked the Rangers and led Steven Gerrard to only the second loss in 18 games since joining Ibrox.
Dolly Meng's intervention proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team made it to the second Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is still without a win in the Premiership this season. Next Sunday his opponent will be the leader Hearts, behind him by eight points.
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extended his series of invincibility in the league to six games. Head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has still not tasted the bitterness of losing.
Livingston against the screaming guests burned chances
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the goal. His straightforwardness made the Rangers not a problem.
Scott Robinson broke through, but his attempt passed in front of the gate. Alan Lithgow's ending then went only past when he slid to Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
The locals happily let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew that guests could cause problems from standard situations.
That’s how the decisive goal was scored.
A direct free kick was played against the Rangers and Livingston managed to penetrate, Declan Gallagher and Robinson found Menga after the combination and he scored from the center of the penalty area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession, but were unable to outperform home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was out of work most of the time.
This continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to do the procedure.
Scott Pittman's attempt stopped Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's legs, and Lithgow ended another standard position of Livingston next door.
By the age of sixteen, the centers were constantly being pushed away by the defenders, but the referee allowed Halkett to continue the game twice, after Halkett's intervention on the alternate Glenn Middleton and after the alleged hand.
"Phenomenal" Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal performance and result of Livingston.
All players as one man were exceptional. On their way up, they continue to exceed expectations.
The style of play and the players in the squad have hardly changed at all since returning to the top competition, but Holt deserves great recognition for how the team has risen since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was unbelievable. He led a perfectly organized defense, while Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall breathe out the whole game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They played well under Gerrard several times, but they did not reach this level.
They missed the final pass – they only got past home defense once – and for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, it’s a raised warning finger.
Erdogan not only received a warm welcome in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin and the mood was excellent.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, the purpose of which is to improve relations between NATO allies.
The dispute arose over issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque there.
The city is home to the largest number of Turks outside Turkey.
Police said they had prevented a group of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters appeared in its vicinity seeking to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents (many of them Kurds) also made themselves known, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him into the country.
Some German Turks call him a hero, while others condemn him for his autocracy.
Road accident in Deptford: the death of a cyclist after a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at about 10:15 British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street. It is a busy road in Deptford in the south-eastern part of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics came to the scene, but the cyclist died at the scene.
The accident occurred just a few months after another cyclist was killed by a driver who fled the scene of the accident. This accident occurred on Childers Street, about 1.5 kilometers from Saturday's accident.
Police said they were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed on site, bus traffic is diverted, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riots
Six prison guards were wounded in riots in a high-security male prison, according to a prison report.
The riots broke out at around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday at the Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire and continue.
The Tornado Special Forces were called to the scene to bring the riots under control, responsible for eight prisoners who managed to be separated into one wing.
The guards at the scene treated minor facial injuries.
A prison administration spokesperson said: “We have deployed a specially trained prison unit to resolve the ongoing incident at the Long Lartin Prison in Britain.
Six employees were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in prisons, and we want to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer behind bars.”
The Long Lartin Prison is serving a sentence of more than 500 inmates, including the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director ended up in hospital after being attacked by one of the inmates.
In addition, in October last year, an anti-insurrection unit was called to the prison to put an end to serious riots, when the prisoners attacked the guards with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry-affected areas may benefit)
The tropical pressure low in Arizona is an exceptional phenomenon, but it is likely to occur at the beginning of next week. The remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa is heading through the desert southwest, bringing with it the risk of severe flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for areas from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to advance directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, with late Monday night as her harbinger of rain.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones within a 320-kilometer radius of Phoenix have had the status of a tropical storm or a pressure one below since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, while in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona it can be up to 15 centimeters in some places.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 millimeters, exceptionally up to 100 millimeters.
In places where there is no threat of flooding, the rain caused by dew can be useful, since the area is plagued by drought.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain is likely to be beneficial as the southwest is currently experiencing a dry period.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is currently facing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa lands first across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is located 620 kilometers south of the Mexican outcrop of Punta Eugenia and heading north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm hit the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, losing intensity.
Therefore, it is expected that when it reaches the Mexican mainland on Monday afternoon or evening, it will have the strength of a tropical storm.
The amount of rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be large, which means a high risk of flooding.
"Between Baja California and northwestern Sonora, total precipitation is expected to be between 75 and 150 millimeters, in some places it may be up to 250 millimeters," weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa will then continue as a tropical storm through Mexico to the north until it reaches the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical pressure low, then heads up through Arizona and reaches southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat to Rosa or her remains is a very large number of collisions in the Baja California region, in the northwest of Sonora and in the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening flooding and debris flooding in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three boys aged 17 to 18 and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder a 16-year-old boy who was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured boy was found Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to hospital and is in a “stabilized” condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset County Police said.
Police are asking anyone who has seen the incident on a mobile phone to come and testify.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the reckless and disgusting tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, vehemently and emotionally rejecting accusations that Christine Blasey-Ford sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in connection with the accusation of interrogation.
The president said Saturday that "the American people had the opportunity to see the uniqueness, character and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of today’s most respected legal experts and a lawyer with a perfect history of service to the public,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“There are five weeks until the election, which is one of the most important in our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m actually running,” he said.
“I’m doing my best to support exceptional candidates.”
Trump said the goal of the Democrats was to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be on the agenda no later than Friday, a senior Republican party trustee told CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia kill hundreds, death toll rises
At least 384 people have been killed and many taken by the waves when huge waves hit the beaches caused by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when in the evening they hit the coast of waves up to six meters high. The waves destroyed everything that stood in their way, and many people came and lived.
The tsunami followed the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach; they did not immediately flee and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB), told a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come by itself. It took away cars, beams, houses, hit everything on land,” Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami was moving at 800 km/h in the open sea before hitting the coast.
He said some people climbed up a tree to escape the tsunami and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 resorts in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, hidden and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent quakes continued in this coastal town on Saturday.
Several earthquakes have been recorded in the area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the powerful Friday earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped during World War II on Hiroshima.
The agency said the intensity of the tsunami may have been increased by the location of the city, which is located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, department stores and hotels collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and damage could be greater in the area of Donggala, located 300 km along the coast north of Palu, because the area is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely paralyzed" and from Donggala "no information is available," Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday for not reporting on the tsunami in Palo, but authorities said the waves arrived at a time when a warning had already been issued.
On an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard shouting desperate warnings that a tsunami is approaching.
Within minutes, a water wall hit the shore, taking buildings and cars with them.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications with the city of Palu and its surroundings, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military had begun sending cargo planes to the site from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees continued to urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The airport was reopened to aid aircraft only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to evacuation centers in Palo for Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision workers from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the workers are hiding in tarpaulin shelters created in the backyard of the office, they walked through the destroyed areas along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
When humanitarian groups embarked on a difficult task and began to work on reconstruction after the disaster, some of them complained that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience were not allowed to come to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and workers from other countries can only start arriving if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Only when the government says it is a national disaster can we open the door to international aid, but this has not yet happened."
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami occurred in Palo, the families and friends of the missing steadfastly hoped that their loved ones would be a miracle in the gloomy story of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble with her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders at the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of those who were imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, one of whom was Mandagi.
“Since I’ve been practicing paragliding for a long time, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Subandono described how hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circled the paragliding community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to contestants in Palo who attended the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one gray tick instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while replenishing an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling up an ATM in the Newport on the Levee area on Friday morning, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and was about to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a report.
While he was busy, another man “runs behind the back of a Brink’s worker” and steals a bag of money to put in.
According to the report, witnesses spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of perpetrators involved in the incident.
If you have information regarding their identity, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he tweeted, “The creature officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is due to unveil his new album Yandhi.
In the show, he will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons", the creator of the show said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West has in the past stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The word Kanye, which means ‘the only one,’ has become Ye. It reflects what is good in us, what is bad, what is confused, everything.
The album reflects what we are.”
He is another of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West’s associate, JAY-Z, also presents himself with a hyphen and without a hyphen and uppercase and lowercase letters.
Mexico's president vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never, under any circumstances, use the military to defeat the Mexican people."
On this square on October 2, 1968, soldiers fired on peaceful protesters, killing up to 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements began to advance throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans with monthly student grants and the opening of more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are causing young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence.
As China is increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this area, said investor and AI promoter Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after various U.S. government entities have expressed their views on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have a general formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
On the contrary, China unveiled its plan last year: by 2030, it wants to be a leader in artificial intelligence innovation.
“As all other countries are far beyond the U.S. and we’re trying to make another breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI), a double AI budget would be a good start,” Lee said.
The double funding could double the chances of another big success in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this week by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the world’s leading companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the highest-rated American player under the name Othello, and later was an executive at Microsoft Research and CEO of Google China.
Lee responded to previous U.S. state-run technology competitions, such as the Robotic Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next one would be held to help uncover future visionaries.
As Lee said, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants.
“The academic leaders are not being taken away from us by China, but by big corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the best brains from universities to work on AI for them.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help support the U.S. in AI.
“I think that holders of a PhD in AI should be automatically offered a green card,” he said.
China’s State Committee released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations distribute money to American scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee says.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (Joint Artificial Intelligence Center), which is intended to involve partners from the industrial and academic communities. The White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
At the same time, this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Conversely, in the U.S. legislation that sought to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, there has been no activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country’s name
Macedonia's citizens voted Sunday in a referendum to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia." The move would resolve a dispute with Greece that has stretched for decades that has blocked Macedonia's requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments drafted an agreement in June to include a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the participation would reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: “Are you in favour of membership of the European Union and NATO through the recognition of the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth allowing Macedonia, a country that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, into communities such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for a future for the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough MPs have declared that they will respect the will of the voters and decide according to the result.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no irregularities during the referendum until 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their ballots in a Macedonian referendum to rename the country to join NATO and the European Union, in the Macedonian city of Strumica on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small podium in front of parliament in Skopje and pulled chairs in front of tents built by opponents who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not by the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We may be a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He added that the resulting “yes” would be “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Surveys said 30 to 43 percent of voters were preparing for the referendum - below the threshold of required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those surveyed, 70 percent said they would vote for the “yes” option.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would mark the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took the lead last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City surpasses the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, broke the Brighton defense and secured a 2-0 win for Manchester City.
Aguero’s elegant goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy at first glance.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He crossed between the three Brighton defenders and ran out into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He pushed around one defender and then circled around several others on the edge of the Brighton block.
He sent the pass to the left, where the ball found Sterling.
The English striker touched the ball for the first time and sent it back to Aguero, who with his right overtook Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the net.
“Aguera has some foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing for about 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what it was.
We were fortunate to have scored at that point.”
But it was Sterling who won the opening advantage for Cityzens in the Premier League meeting.
His goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero reached the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
He sent a wonderful pass along the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a couple of times and led Sterling towards the distant stall.
The attacker Cityzens touched the ball into the net just before it slipped into the car.
City is set to play Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer Wants to Ruin Rockies Opportunities
When the Nationals dropped out of the playoffs, there was not much reason to force themselves into the next start.
But extremely competitive Scherzer hopes to face the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, albeit only if there are still consequences for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Western Division.
With a 5:2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies retained at least the wild card option, but they still have to confirm their first division title.
Even if we’re not playing for anything, at least we can get on the pitch with the idea that with the atmosphere here in Denver and with such a crowd and an opponent, that’s probably the highest level we’re going to get this year.
Of course I want to experience it.”
The Nationals have not yet announced a first pitcher for Sunday, but it appears they will have Scherzer pitched in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, would throw a bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, when he usually waves a rest day.
The Washington right-handed has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA points and 300 strike-outs for 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
The president implicitly pointed to the situation around his Supreme Court justice nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the Midterms.
“In November, everything we’ve achieved will be at stake.
There are five weeks left until the most important election of our lives.
It’s a huge, huge opportunity. Even though I’m not running myself, I’m actually running, that’s why I go up and down the country and fight for our great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, really terrible radical group of Democrats. It’s happening right in front of our eyes.
They are determined to regain power by any means, vile and malicious.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to push over to gain power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, went on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"You could see it in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "angry, mean, evil and lying."
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, namely Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was met with a loud beep from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let that document escape?
Um, um, what?
No, um, no, I, wait - her body language was really bad - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer liberal.
They do not tolerate those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists voted for my reprimand, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last Labour Member who has been told that he is no longer welcome - all for expressing an opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, he criticized my disapproval of Jeremy Corbyn.
It was about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically, about similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Labour meeting in Nottingham on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday evening GC meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings today do not take that tone, and the promise of a “milder, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever paid for.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differences of opinion are not tolerated within the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because colleagues, whom I had previously thought shared a similar political stance, suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and adopt views that I would never have otherwise agreed to – be it national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak publicly — and it doesn’t matter what I say, basically — there’s a tirade of criticism on social media calling for an appeal, giving up center politics, and listening as if I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Of course, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me tend to be only political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face the thunder of sexist or racist attacks every day and never hide from it.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is how the level of attacks has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer those notorious liberals, and with every stimulus to express “mistrust” or change the selection rules, the party becomes increasingly narrow.
Over the past two years, a lot of people have advised me not to stand out too much from the crowd, be quiet and keep up, and then I’ll be “all right.”
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, provoked by the indifference of Thatcher’s government to allow my high school classroom to literally collapse, I’ve been trying to push for better public services for those who need it most – whether in the local council or in the ministry.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could be confused by my political stances and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative on Friday, I would only say that when a country is creeping towards a Brexit that hurts households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy to address my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the main message that I have is not the vermin of the Momentum initiative in Nottingham. It is for the inhabitants of my district, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have been able to serve you and I promise you that I am trying to make no threats of dismissal, I am not afraid of you for the sake of political calculus.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr gets to the top
Two late attempts may have wavered the final result slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a triumph in this amazingly captivating match of the Tennant's Premiership day.
He was now at the top of the table as the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, their victory brought home a great defense, as well as better use of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to rejoice.
“We’ve had a lot of tests during the games and we’re undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Hat down in front of Ayr, they took a better chance than we did."
Thanks to Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which turned Frazier Climo, Ayr took the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to overrun, and Jason Baggot recorded an unchanged attempt.
Climo drew Ayr's lead with a penalty and then, exactly in the half, scored a solo attempt, thanks to which Ayr could go on a break with a result of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed into Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
This was followed by a protracted delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had been suspended, and as soon as the game began to resume, Ayr came further into the lead by an attempt by Stafford McDowall to transform Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and Melrose used it as an unchanged attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the meeting under heavy pressure.
However, the home side revived, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting Clima without the ball, MacPherson scored a touch-down from a penalty shootout with an approaching horde of Ayr behind his back.
Climo transformed, similar to almost the beginning of the action, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong’s box kick and sent Gregor Henry’s wing away on the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game Star Embarks on New Career in Gastronomy
The star of the British Still Game series, Ford Kieran, is apparently starting a career in the service industry. According to our information, he was appointed director of a company with a license to operate a restaurant.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last, and Kiernan appears to be planning a life outside of the Glasgow suburb of Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "blooming restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, cut off from the sea, hopes to regain access to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors besiege the naval headquarters in La Paz dressed in sails.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are shrouded in the motto: “The sea is our right.
Getting it back is our job.”
Throughout Bolivia, cut off from the sea, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to re-run the waters of the Pacific Ocean.
After five years of trial, Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October.
“Bolivia is on the rise, it has a spirit of unity and balance, and of course it believes in a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the international court’s ruling on big screens across the country in the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate for sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president who will take part in the controversial re-election fight next year, also has something to say about Monday’s decision.
"Our return to the Pacific Ocean is within reach," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia’s favor – and even if it did, much would not have changed.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the international court’s ruling comes just six months after hearing the final arguments suggests that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And while there can be no doubt about Bolivia’s arguments, it is possible that it has taken a step backwards in recent years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been grasped by the current Bolivian government," Zárate said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has undermined all of Chile’s remaining accommodatingness, she hinted.
Bolivia and Chile will one day resume negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to maintain dialogue.
The two countries have not had an ambassadorial representation since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s deputy in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court’s decision would be unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia an “extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance “to end 139 years of disagreement and achieve mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also dismissed the claim that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — would use the maritime question as a political barista.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“A decision is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea rejects nuclear disarmament until it can trust U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not be the first to get rid of nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of resuming diplomatic talks on the nuclear issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Ri says it is an illusion to think that constant U.S. sanctions and protests against a declaration to end the Korean War could bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its arsenal, which the country very likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest trends in impressive headgear that you’ll soon find in your store
If you want to expand your collection of hats or perfectly protect yourself from the sun, you do not need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their spring/summer 19 collection on the pier a whole range of unusual oversized headgear that stunned viewers at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their shocking creations to the show pier.
A unique piece from Valentin was a voluminous beige hat decorated with a downy roof that covered the heads of the models.
Other extra-sized accessories included a melon lined with precious stones, a witch hat, and even a pineapple—but these aren’t meant to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had stitched lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One resembled a diving gear, including a snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a molten ice cream cone.
And if you like bold fashion expressions – you’re in luck.
Style experts predict that huge hats will also get into regular stores in your area.
The oversized hats follow the inspiration of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a roof 60 centimeters wide worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowska.
The iconic brand behind the highly impractical hat lurking around every corner of social media sent another big creation to the pier – a straw beach bag almost as big as the model dressed in a swimsuit that carries it.
The raffia bag of burnt orange color, framed with raffia patches and complemented by a white leather ear, was a unique piece of the La Riviera spring/summer 19 collection from Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, “I expect big hats and beach bags to come to regular stores next summer – since the designer had such a huge impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Without language skills, the global citizen cannot get away with it
Scottish independent schools maintain outstanding academic performance and this trend continues in 2018 with another year of outstanding exam scores, further strengthening individual and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare pupils for further and higher education, careers according to their ideas and a place in the world as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement tailor-made curricula, we still perceive modern languages as a popular and sought-after elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “When you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you speak to his heart.”
It is a strong reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
From this year’s exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest average scores among independent schools.
In total, up to 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest A mark.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved the highest A mark in Mandarin Chinese, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as basic skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered to be as important as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects in independent and other schools as elective subjects.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of the reasons employers cited as job recruitment problems were lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more prospective jobs are created that require languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses, as long as he has learned a second language, with such a lifelong ability he will have a real advantage for the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give a multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any foreign language sufficiently to be able to communicate fluently, with French being the only language where the number of people reached double-digit percentages (15 percent).
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
Knowledge of multiple languages, especially those of advanced economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different according to the languages it teaches.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK in terms of the future in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, in independent schools he will always be able to choose from a variety of languages and will be taught by experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At present, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages remain crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be called "international communication abilities."
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellent quality to young people in Scotland.
It's going to be fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is set to debut in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James' first game for the Los Angeles Lakers will soon be waiting.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is unclear how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James commented on his plans for the Lakers' six-match pre-match schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I no longer need to start pre-games,” he said.
Trump's meetings in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched a series of election meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s planned meetings next week, including stops at related locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
After abstaining from voting for his candidate for a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming midterms as Republicans face a loss of control over the vote in November.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia today, and where can you watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, takes place at 19:00 Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia meeting online below, via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on the current hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which has been strained by sexual harassment allegations, with the Senate’s expected confirmation vote postponed for a week while FBI investigations are ongoing.
But the primary goal of this series of meetings is mainly to help the Republicans, who are waiting for the tough November elections, to regain strength.
According to Reuters, the five meetings next week are aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.
“Control of Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when he enters the busy election season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
“Today’s meeting, held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh,” West Virginia Metro News said in a statement.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in a month, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump has sought to back West Virginia Republican senator Patrick Morrisey, whose preferences are lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to raise his polling preferences,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage to fight and hopes to be successful in Sunday’s individual fights
After three one-sided series, Saturday afternoon foursome matches can be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs.
The oscillating pendulum of momentum is an invented sporting concept, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions of this type.
So, on which side do they think the driving force is now?
"They led by six points, now it's only four, so we could say we have a slight momentum now," Jordan Spieth said as he was preparing for his competition day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, a four-point lead and another twelve in the game.
As Spieth says, however, Americans feel a slight wind in their sails and have plenty of reason to hope, among other things thanks to the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been insurmountable from the launch to the last hole and leads the others by his example.
As his lap progressed, throaty celebratory cries grew louder, sinking a key putt and a fourth match was tied when he and Thomas each had two less by two.
His putt, who won their match at 15, celebrated with a similar shout, proving his belief that the American team is not yet lost in the competition.
“You just have to roll up your sleeves and start thinking about your own game,” Spieth said.
There is nothing left for any of the players.
18 holes for which you need to achieve the maximum.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed favourites of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming European couple have four out of four and have no way to make a mistake.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who didn’t shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the other nine holes on Friday morning.
This round and the way the energy flows between the turbulent crowd and the players confirm that these players will have to be beaten on Sunday, and there is hardly a more popular player to consolidate a potential European victory at sunset over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best of both at the same time on different holes.
However, talk of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played in a pair with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and Swede a hole from which they were no longer able to dig.
There's no one here on Sunday to help you dig out of the pit.
Fourball and foursome matches are fascinating when viewed up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give each other, and how the strategy can change from minute to minute.
Europe has played better so far and has a substantial lead by the final day, but these foursome rounds also showed that the US team is not afraid to fight, which some, especially on the American continent, doubted.
On the day of the final of the Ryder Cup, Europe takes the lead 10:6
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a substantial advantage after completing Saturday's fourball and foursome matches against the United States 10:6.
Encouraged duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over tormented Tiger Woods, to credit their account in Le Golf National so far four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European side, in an effort to keep the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated the failing American side in the morning fourball matches and won the series 3-1.
In foursome matches, the Americans offered more resistance, they won two matches, but they could not catch their deficit.
Jim Fury’s party needs eight points out of Sunday’s 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while together with Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", they are only the second pair to win four points in their opening four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball matches, they excellently consolidated their performance and defeated the depressed Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by even more impressive 5&4s.
Woods, who drove two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but ultimately lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome matches and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who missed the morning fourball matches, returned to accompany Henrik Stenson in the foursome, and together they defeated 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – one and three in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not have it easy on that pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, three-time winners, set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They earned a scrawny 2&1 win over Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball matches and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome matches after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team managed to get out of the four-point deficit when entering individual matches, although Furyk's side, as a defender of the title, only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after two days in second place, Sunday’s counterattack seems likely to be beyond their means.
North Korea will not unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions had deepened distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world institution that North Korea has taken "substantial steps" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and committing not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see any response from the United States," he added.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s opposition to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament that would reward North Korea in taking step-by-step steps, his position was crucial in not immediately rejecting unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the incumbent U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised North Korea a security guarantee.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to release tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists first on nuclear disarmament and increases tensions through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive way and even by objecting to a 'declaration to end the war,'" Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees is an illusion of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump, which the U.S. president told the United Nations earlier this week.
But he stressed three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other side of the issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea instead of the US, disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end.”
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil” Trump called Kim a “missile man on a suicide mission.”
This year, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year, sang praise to Kim at the UN for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but said there was still a lot of work ahead of him and sanctions must remain until North Korea is de-nuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, saying "it doesn't matter if it takes two, three years or five months."
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the sanctions imposed by the Security Council must continue rigorously and without exception until we achieve complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in a bid to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang with the view that progress had been made, but hours later he was condemned by North Korea for making “gangster demands.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile test site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
Kim told him that the “corresponding measures” he expected were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to relax enough
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is to ensure that all students get more sleep in an effort to suppress the growing trend of studying all night long with the help of caffeine.
Researchers have found that students at the world’s leading university are often clueless when it comes to the complete basics of caring for their health.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Clinic, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after a lecture he gave about sleep deprivation and its impact on learning.
“At the end, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only learning about this now, in my senior year?’
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
This year’s first course explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance while improving overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health service, said the university decided to open the course when it found that students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the work week.
The course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a screenshot of a boarding school where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books, and learn about the effects of caffeine, light, and how lack of sleep affects sports performance, and how important a regular sleep regimen is.
In the next section, participants will learn how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons further encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as everyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
There is still a culture in which students are proud to have been able to learn all night, he says, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation has become a growing problem.
Ensuring enough good quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said – even against weight gain, as sleep deficiency puts the brain into starvation mode, so they constantly feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his seminars last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to try to pursue the course at the university level.
He hopes that in the next step it will be possible to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before embarking on a challenging study.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set their alarm clocks for both the time to go to bed and the time to wake up, realizing the harmful effects of “blue light” that electronic screens and LED lighting emit, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 : 0 Rangers: Mengo's goal sinks Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another round of grief in a game outside when a shot by Dolly Meng condemned the scattered team of Steven Gerrard to a 1–0 loss in Livingstone.
Guests from Ibrox tried to record their first victory outside since the February 4–1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only brought Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager and left his team in the position of 8 points from the leaders of the table Ladbrokes Premier.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half and the Rangers, who lacked inspiration, did not even come close to equalizing.
While the Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston has climbed to third and is behind Hibernian with only one goal difference.
And the Rangers may have other problems after line referee Calum Spence suffered a head injury because he was hit by an object apparently thrown from the guest stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, and then the Rangers outperformed Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt left the same eleven to Livi, who took away the Hearts point last week, and was thrilled at how his well-built squad suffocated his opponents in every action.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston was more active when he got to the ball.
They were only supposed to score in the second minute of the match, when Meng's first recall from the field sent Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder squandered his big chance.
A long straight kick Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense, Alan Lithgow, only managed to miss the rear pole far.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third they seemed to have more hope than conviction in their game.
Alfredo Morelos claimed a penalty after a quarter of the game when he collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers managed to score only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely taken out by Lassan Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejariu's tame shot.
Although Livi’s opening goal in the 34th minute could have been inconsistent with the course of the game, no one can argue that they deserved it just for their effort.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' corner.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher moved the ball with a slit to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted in the break, swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the swap had an almost immediate impact when the wingman found Morelos, but the impressive Kelly hurried out of his line and blocked him.
But Livingston continued to force the guests to play exactly the type of game they liked when Lithgow and Halkett shot one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have stretched his lead in the final stages, but McGregor defended Jacobs well and then resisted Lithgowa's wide head from the corner.
Rangers deputy Glenn Middleton later claimed a penalty when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson overlooked it again.
The Inventor of the Geiger Computer
And now we have a page from our Sunday morning chronicle: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... that was the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the construction of a device known as the Geiger computer.
Geiger's computer, in addition to being an integral part of science to this day, also became a staple of pop culture when it was talked about in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" by science-smelling cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger computer, it detects radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you can actually hear the sounds of atoms that are produced by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Really, I can hear them cracking!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
A New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
They then “see” the protein common to many types of cancer and are injected back into the body.
The tested vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
In this method, the patient's immune cells are extracted, modified in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and then injected back into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “supports the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West with a MAGA hat on his head has been the target of criticism for his support for Trump after performing on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was whistled in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he sang to US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
When he finished his third track, Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat that read “Make America Great” on his head, he launched an attack against the Democrats and stressed his support for Trump.
“So many times I talked to a white guy and he said to me, ‘How can you accept Trump, because he’s a racist?’
Well, if racism were bothering me, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
Saturday Night Live (SNL) began with a scene with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West’s speech was not aired, comedian Chris Rock posted it on social media.
It’s unclear if Rock was trying to make West laugh with his sharing.
West also complained to the audience that he had had a tough time behind the scenes for his hat.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me, ‘Don’t go there with that hat on your head.’
I was usually bullied.
And then they told me I was down," he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see me at the bottom? I’ll put on my Superman coat because it means no one will tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments earned a buzz from the audience at least twice, and the rest of the performers in the SNL were embarrassed, Variety magazine reported, with one person telling the media: "There was grave silence throughout the studio."
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many when the song I Love It performed dressed like a bottle of Perrier water.
TPUSA leader Candace Turner tweeted, “A message for one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR STANDING AGAINST THE DAVID.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West “was just himself and that’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I am determined NOT to replace someone (by buying his music, his clothing brand, or by promoting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
And we are too," she added.
Before the show began, the rapper said on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he would now be "Ye", formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, continuing in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was also called Snoop Lion, and of course there is the deceased musical legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist, formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The police confirmed that the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword-armed Jon Snow in the harsh medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones from HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor denounced the stereotype of a male hero, saying that for such characters on the screen, young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he says that “something has gotten out of hand somewhere and is considering how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones colleague, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that solving the problem was “very important”.
“Personally, I feel that it is very important to address where we got something wrong in masculinity,” he said.
“What do we teach men during adolescence when the problem that we see now arises?”
Kit is convinced that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity for its exaggerated masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What does television teach, and what happens on the streets, that young boys feel that they must have this particular side of masculinity?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
Because it’s clear that something’s gone wrong with the young men somewhere.”
In the interview, he also admitted that when the series ends next summer, he will no longer shoot any prologues or sequels to Game of Thrones, because "it is over with battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new adaptation of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
“It’s because of this show that I met my wife, so in a sense she gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
The Emmy-winning fantasy series starred Rose Ygritte, the love of the whale character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
More than 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 annually.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Due to conservative country values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sexual intercourse with a man will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that her employee would let GOP senators’ data leak, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had sent the personal data of three Republican senators to the lawmaker's Wikipedia page.
A Democrat in Los Angeles says the allegations come from “far-right” experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and other contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate jury hearing on sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Information leaked some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the leaks were linked to Waters' office and provided information about a member of Waters' staff, Hill said.
“This unconfirmed allegation is completely false and absolutely false,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of such fraudulent and false accusations was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unconfirmed accusation is completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism online, among others from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Her denial is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He must not behave defiantly.
He must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
He needs to be calm and balanced.”
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's interrogations.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s big,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified her of fraudulent allegations by relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and are held legally accountable for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English strikes again – an undersized spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
Nowadays, it’s common to look for references to Brexit in every new British-looking film, and this also applies to this reincarnation of the action comedy parody with Johnny English – which was first shown in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will it become an ironic self-satire about how clearly we are incapable of a new national export item?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his distinctive facial expressions has gained the opportunity to screw everything up again – with his name signaling better than anything else that he is a generous comic creation designed especially for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, the clumsy undercover agent who, despite his bizarre claims to gentle charm, has a little bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr Bean, and a spoonful of the guy who contributed a single tone to the opening tune of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Opening Ceremony.
His character is also based on the international traveler and mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercials on Barclaycard, leaving chaos everywhere behind.
In this last adventure of Johnny English, one or two sweet moments can be found.
I liked how Johnny English came to the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller hit his helmet slightly.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is evident here, but humor sounds a bit sub-dimensional and oddly superficial, especially when “serious” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves are now confidently offering comedy as one of their components.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s strange adventures aren’t as inventive and striking as Atkinson’s wordless gags portrayed by Mr. Bean.
The current background of the film is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy web network and, to scare off serving agent Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately missed a small role, has revealed the identities of all British agents in the area.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, who is a pompous and combative figure who is already on the verge of collapse due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with a figure of the sort of Teresa May, but in the script she has little to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that if every active spy has been betrayed, she will have to call someone into retirement.
So Johnny English himself comes on the scene, now employed as a director at a fancy institution, giving private lessons on how to become a secret spy: here you will find a few pleasant gags, as English gives lessons from espionage in the style of the School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets his former longtime sidekick, Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, attached to an affectionate submarine commander, whose role Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a pity.
So Batman and Robin, who are masters of disasters in Her Majesty’s secret services, are back in full swing and bump into the gorgeous femme fatale, Ophelia Bullet, by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously succumbs to the charm of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd skirmishes: in disguise as waiters, they set fire to a glittering French restaurant; they cause chaos when they smuggle onto Volta’s luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use the house’s interior, a virtual reality device.
All the tricks are pulling out of the sleeve in the last minutes, but however impressive and tumultuous they may be, it all feels a bit like a children’s television program.
The overall impression is more or less average.
And as with other Johnny English films, I still have to think about why the British film industry doesn’t finally give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies working on a UK four-day workweek plan paid as five-day
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party is considering a radical plan to give Britain a four-day work week, but they get paid in five days.
The party allegedly wants company leaders to redistribute the savings generated by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to give workers an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend, but home would carry the same paychecks.
Sources say the idea would "correspond" to the party's economic plans to lean the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day working week has supported the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “We expect an evaluation of the proposal to be published by the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that matches the party’s approach to balancing the economy to the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour would not be the first to support the idea, with the Greens including a four-day working week in their 2017 election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole is not pushing ahead.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy, nor is it being considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell stated his determination to regain power from “anonymous CEOs” and “rich people” in services.
At the same time, the shadow chancellor’s plans mean that current shareholders in the water companies would not recover their entire shares, because the Labour government could apply “collapses” on the basis of the found fault.
At the same time, he confirmed plans to include employees in the company’s board of directors and create an Inclusive Equity Fund, so that 10 percent of the private sector companies’ capital would reach employees who could receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy spoke on 60 Minutes about whether the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether the agency’s findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something they would change their minds about.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“As I said when I went to the interrogation, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the accusations were made, and I asked, ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined and unambiguous.”
Graham's voice seems to be firmly established.
“I’ve already made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and there would have to be some kind of bulletproof accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied everything,” Graham said.
“No one he’s naming can confirm that.
That thing is 36 years old.
I don’t see how anything could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how does it contribute to poverty reduction?
On Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive cast of stars with an even more impressive mission: Ending World Hunger.
In their seventh year, tens of thousands of people will gather on the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If viewers want to get a ticket to an event for free (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), they must complete a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or other meaningful way to raise awareness of the event’s goal of ending poverty.
There are still 12 years left, so how far does Global Citizen really go to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert in an appropriate way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clicism” – where people feel they are actually making a difference when they sign an online petition or tweet?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters since 2011, pushing them toward different goals.
The organization says the actions helped stir up world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported that its shares resulted in 390 commitments and statements, with at least $10 billion already paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the UK who are committed to "helping children reach their full potential," while promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after they receive more than 700 t of the country's citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make malnutrition a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutition’s ambassador to the crowd, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutition project, which will provide 5 million women and children with nutritional contributions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “How do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responded: “It’s going to be a long and arduous journey – sometimes we’re going to fall and fail.
But just like the great civil rights movements and the anti-apartheid movement ahead, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the celebrities who will perform at this year’s event in New York, along with moderators Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a “blockade” to curb Russian energy exports, Interior Secretary says
“If necessary,” Washington can call on its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s involvement in Syria – where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe the main reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy there, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern stomach of Europe,” he said.
According to him, there are ways and methods to deal with it.
"The United States can, using the navy, ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, make a blockade to ensure that their energy does not get to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at the event, which is being held under the auspices of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is positioning itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the US.
He further compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic option against Iran and Russia is more less use and replacement of fuels,” he said, noting that Russia has only one trick in its pocket because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration embarks on a mission to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step back from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, making Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow, according to Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s zealous opposition to the project is driven by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I am convinced that we share the same view that energy cannot be a coercive tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance brought resistance from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Union of German Industry (BDI), has urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Union (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “seriously consider” running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that requires a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider the presidential candidacy.”
Warren told President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city hall that she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m worried to the bone about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly expressed her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, she tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
But a poll released on Thursday found that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Center, 50 percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent would support his candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of his potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among Democrats who are being talked about in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Speaks at Donald Trump Meeting on PTSD Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was drafted into the military on September 11, 2007 and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested on Monday and charged with domestic violence.
“With what my own son has been going through since he returned, I can identify with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers are returning with,” she told viewers at a Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an “elephant in the room” and said of her son and other war veterans that “they are returning home a bit different, tougher, they are returning with a question of whether people have respect for what their fellow fighters and aviators and all other members of the army have given to this country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interference with a report of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotics, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. filed an amicus curiae in Washington on Friday in support of asylum seekers’ objections to the new policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions action brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and his sons, members of a violent gang,” had abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Representatives of states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a high number of U.S. asylum seekers originate, as nations facing serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a decision violates this principle,” the statement said.
Representatives further argued in the filing that policies that deny immigrants entry are damaging to the U.S. economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs and “supply the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum should never have been designed to solve all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Pal is doubling, and desperate efforts are underway to save the survivors
For the rescuers, the situation was steadily deteriorating.
“It’s very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to rock her restless little boy in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings a body.
“Clean water is rare.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes, digging through their flooded belongings, and saving everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, burst into seams.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to his spine and shoulders, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palo, where patients were treated outside for severe concussions.
His eyes filled with tears as he remembered the feeling of a devastating earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think the falling ruins pushed me against the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" through "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador accused China of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid ad by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s top-selling newspaper — after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, but China denies the accusation.
According to U.S. officials, Trump’s accusation of Beijing’s attempts to interfere in the U.S. election is a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise for trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war in which both sides regulate tariffs on each other’s imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade conflict were supposed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
As Branstad wrote in his post to the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “China has now doubled its bullying by publishing its promotional ads in our free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, China is exploiting America’s revered tradition of free speech and free press by publishing paid ads in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in a newsstand on the streets here in Beijing, you will find only limited dissenting voices, and you will not get any real picture of the diverse views that Chinese citizens may have on China’s problematic economic trajectory, as the media are under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers rejected his offer to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that for the debacle with Kavanaugh, Republicans are marie chances with female voters
With many leading Republicans backing and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several sexual assault allegations, analysts warn that it will take revenge on them in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotion surrounding the case was extremely strong, and a majority of Republicans have already said they want to proceed to the vote.
“These things can’t go back,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that a last-minute request from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, an adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted in the hallways of the Senate "November is coming!" as Republicans on the Judicial Commission decided to continue Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will cross all boundaries,” Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news portal.
“People say the motivation is already high; and it’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who may not like the president, but often do not vote.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she gave details of her sexual harassment allegations against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested there could be a fierce reaction if Republicans confirmed his support.
“This has become a big mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Commission, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the vote of the commission or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits in the bench, it’s also about how the Republicans reacted to it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities Group, which helps vote Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to be split about who to trust at the dawn of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with favor favoring rather Ford.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said Kavanaugh was likely or certain to have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following a push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Commission last week under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals when they attended a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world wide web plans to launch a new Internet to overcome Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, called Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide whether their data is stored and who is allowed access to individual information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind the Inrupt project was to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application using Solid technology allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and work tools.
It’s something like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all available on a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that only the user decides who will have access to each type of information.
The company calls it “the empowerment of personal powers through data.”
Inrupt’s goal, according to CEO John Bruce, is to bring the resources, the process, and the appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several internal developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world have been able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not discussing with “Facebook and Google whether they will implement a complete change that will completely overnight overturn all their business models or not.”
“We’re not asking for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a Medium post on Saturday that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in discussions about net neutrality.
Berners-Lee is the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Priest Bernard Vann: celebrations of the Victorian Cross for the First World War
The only Anglican priest who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was celebrated in his hometown on the 100th anniversary.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned of Britain's highest military honor.
At a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren unveiled a plaque on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "wonderfully symbolic" that the record was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning heroic fight.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and with heavy fire of field weapons and machine guns."
Later, he hurried across the line of fire and led the troops forward with "the highest courage" while disarming three of the field weapons himself.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions "are something I'll never get close to in my life, but it makes me feel a deep humility."
Together with their brother, Dr. James Vann, they laid a wreath at the end of the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he “feel very honored to be able to attend the parade” and added that “the courage of a true hero demonstrates the support that many people will give him.”
MMA fans waited late into the night for the conclusion of Bellator 206 and instead got the series Pig Peppa
Imagine staying up all night to watch the thrilling finale of Bellator 206 and finally not seeing the main event.
The San Jose schedule consisted of 13 matches, including six main ones, and was broadcast live throughout the night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to confront each other, viewers in the UK were shocked when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting.
Some were really disappointed because they waited until morning especially for this match.
A Twitter fan described the switch to a children’s fairy tale as “some kind of sick joke.”
“It’s a government decree that this content was inappropriate from 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Yes, it was 'Peppa Pig'."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they would work to make sure that their broadcasts could be watched by viewers in the UK in the future.
“When I think about repetitions, I think we can sort it out,” Coker said.
“But it’s Sunday morning at six o’clock in their time, and we won’t be able to resolve it until Sunday of our time, that is, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it happened, we exchanged a lot of messages, and we weren't exactly friendly.
We tried to correct it, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a matter of government regulations.
I can promise you it won't happen again next time.
Let’s cut it to five games instead of six – as we usually do – we tried to give the fans something more and we stretched it.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Less Valuable’ for His Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he felt inferior to others for his sexuality as a teenager – but that’s what motivated him to become successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said that it wasn’t until high school that he realized that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs show, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to care a little less about winning the Olympics.
Regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
As an outcast on the first show with Laverne Daley, he said that during his teens he felt "less than everyone else because it was not socially permissible for anyone to like both boys and girls."
In his own words: “Until today, I really felt inferior and different, and that gave me the strength and motivation to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint everyone after learning about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a leading LGBT rights activist and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he was lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give this “hope” to others as well.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – he was “surprised.”
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years older than him last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem for them.
“When you go through so much at a young age” – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and three years later his father died of cancer – “it’s hard to find a peer who will experience similar successes and misfortunes.”
The couple became parents in June, having a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole worldview" had changed.
“If you asked me a year ago, I would only talk about how I need to get a gold medal,” he said.
“And you know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the idea of death and one of the last things he asked him was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to be in the first place.
“I couldn’t tell him, Dad, you’re not going to be here anymore so you can sit in the front row,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he really stopped breathing and was dead that I was able to finally admit that he wasn’t immortal,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that’s what I’ve dreamed of all my life – jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
The story also inspired his choice of song – Stream by Heather Small – which impressed him in preparation for the Olympics and still gives him chills.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson down for Ryder Cup games on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to show himself in better shape so that it won’t be an unfortunate milestone for him.
Mickelson, who plays at the two-year event for a record 12th time, was knocked down by Captain Jim Furyk during Saturday's fourball and foursome matches.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as many times before for the US, the five-time winner spent the day alternately encouraging and improving his game in the hope of fixing his reputation.
The 48-year-old didn’t shoot the most straight, even at the height of his career, which is not ideal for the tight Le Golf National field, where in long-distance runs usually take revenge for the wrong shots.
And as if the pitch itself wasn’t a challenge enough, Mickelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday’s ninth match, who won all matches this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are four points behind before the start of 12 individual matches, manage to make a good start, Mickelson’s performance could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband, but he could hardly say anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, grabbed me around my shoulder and said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has high self-confidence.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed significantly to our teams in the past and this week as well.
I couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it was crystallized, and we felt like that's how we had to do it.
He wants to be out on the lawn, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Falda's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup games.
This could be the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, which never reached the heights of his individual balance sheet.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk says his presence has brought some incalculable value to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to make jokes about people and he’s a great companion,” he said.
“I think even the younger players had a lot of fun with him and it was great to watch.
It’s not just in his game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that strong leadership may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from his own experience that a considerable lead in entering individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Danish golfer made his debut at a game in 1997 in Valderrama, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but nevertheless made it through the finish line with the narrowest possible victory 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I have to constantly remember how we had a strong lead in Valderrama; we had a strong lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama we won, but just like that,” said Bjorn, in the photo, after the team won 5:3 on Friday and led Le Golf National with a score of 10 yesterday.
So history shows me and everyone on the team that the game is not over yet.
We'll go full throttle tomorrow.
We'll stand on the lawn and do everything right.
Until there are points on the board, the game is not over.
We have a goal, and that is to win this trophy, that is what we need to focus on.
“As I said from the start, I’m targeting 12 players on our side, but I’m also well aware that we’re facing the other side – the best players in the world.”
Excited about how well his players did on a challenging golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never be ahead of the curve.
Tomorrow we have another fight.
Tomorrow is going to be an individual performance, and that is something completely different.
It’s great to be on the pitch with your partner when you’re doing well, but when you’re standing there on your own, it’s going to test all your golf abilities.
This is a message that players need to remember to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now leave your partner and he has to go and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, colleague Jim Furyk will want his players to play better than individuals than they did as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of the big tournaments on the last day when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up defeated when Europe achieved the “Miracle in Medina”.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 encouraged his players to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you want to start quickly as you saw it in Brooklyn, as you saw it in Medina.
When this momentum starts in one direction, the middle matches matter.
We created our line-up and placed the boys in a way that felt like we were going to try to do some magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in the top game, with the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the top half.
"I went with this group of boys in that order because I thought that's how we'd go all the way," Bjorn said of the selection of his individuals.
Germany's new warship has been delayed
The latest frigate of the German navy was supposed to be put into service in 2014 as a replacement for aging warships from the Cold War, but this will not happen until next year due to faulty systems and accumulation of costs.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of a completely new class of frigates of Baden-Württemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project suffered from worrying problems after delivery.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will come to replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secrecy technologies, such as reduced radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include a longer maintenance periodicity – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside domestic ports.
But the continuous delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships that have enabled Germany to demonstrate power overseas will become obsolete by the time they enter service, reports Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned several major "software and hardware errors" that made the warship unusable in deploying to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of around 120 seamen – only half the workforce on the older Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is considered to be twice as heavy as similar classes of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) <0xE2><0x88><0x92> up from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important given recent warnings that German naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of Germany’s parliamentary defense committee, confirmed that the navy actually “does not have ships capable of deploying”.
The government official said that this issue has been packed up over time because the old ships have been decommissioned, but no replacement vessels have been provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the navy.
The National Trust reveals the secret life of bats
The new research, which is being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how bats use the land for their food hunting.
We hope the findings shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow whistling bats and whistling bats, as well as light-colored and water-colored bats in the Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
They place special recorders at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
The organization’s staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and the activity of each species.
They then create a map of their natural environment and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a large scale.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the natural environment are most important for bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help determine the benefits of environmental management work such as meadow formation and how best to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are endangered by construction and development works that have an impact on grassland and environmental loss.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as aircraft and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks can also be a danger.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are like eyes when it comes to hunting prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to accurately identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of assemblies and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even established the first and only dedicated bat-protected area on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Thread we have an amazing space for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of protected trees and all good habitats.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It stresses the importance of checking bats before performing maintenance within the property, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one parent assembly could kill up to 400 females and cubs, which would likely destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, disturb, or destroy their assemblies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to get involved.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we simply don't know how many of our species feed on their populations."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, while lawyers filed a lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls rape allegations “fake news” and says people want to be “visible” using his name.
His lawyers will file a lawsuit against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were made public, the 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram, calling the allegations “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or to the camera.
“They want to be known by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that’s part of my job.
“I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel on charges they called “an inadmissible report of privacy suspicions.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount appropriate to the seriousness of the offence, which is arguably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player’s room after a meeting at the nightclub, where he allegedly raped her anally.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a "99% good guy" who failed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “scared for retaliation” and feared “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to rethink the deal because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer moved to Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' loss of carmakers
The UK “would regret forever” losing its status as a world leader in automotive production after Brexit, trade secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at a factory in Burnastone near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cut jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnastone.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced concerns about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small Oxford plant a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what automakers refer to as supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be border breaches, which could lead to delays and a shortage of parts in the industry.
It would have been impossible for Toyota to hold more than the daily value of inventories at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would have stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to prevent these border controls".
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that allows us to not only talk about the current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Proof not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is the fact that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would stop, but in the long run it warned that the additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately increase the cost of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnastone for 24 years and is a member of the Trade Union at the plant, said his members are increasingly worried: “In my experience, when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible roadmap for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed, says White House
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed to another week” as candidate Brett Kavanaugh’s fight for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and potential obstruction of the president’s investigation.
Washington has been gossiping for months about whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thus jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of using wiretapping to record conversations with Trump and impeach the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
Last Monday, he went to the White House, where new information emerged that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN in New York at the time, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The deadline for this was not set, it could be this week, I understand the shift to another week given all the other things that are happening with the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters have denied this claim: Sanders has not held a brief White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of short press briefings was not due to the resentment of TV reporters wanting to dazzle, though she said: “I disagree with the fact that they want to dazzle.”
She then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president makes more meetings based on the concept of questions and answers than any other president before him,” she added, without citing evidence: “Let’s look at those numbers.”
Short press briefings are still going on, Sanders said, but “if the press has a chance to ask a question directly to the President of the United States, it’s incomparably better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and in the last few weeks you have seen us very often, there will be a brief press conference when you will be able to speak with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Separate press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have been demonstrating why when he appeared freely and several times bizarrely in front of rallied journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU staff at the National Health Service in Scotland about concerns about Brexit
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working for the National Health Service in Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and wish that they remain after the end of Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Jeane Freeman sent the letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of permanent residence applications for EU citizens working in their public services transferred.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the exit have continued, heading towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would now like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes urgent surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent an urgent operation after a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State Reed's head coach told reporters he was injured shortly before half-time.
“He came to the sideline and somehow collapsed there,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further examination.
A Tennessee State team official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is at the Vanderbilt Medical Center after the operation.
Harris added that there were “no details about the type/size of the injury” yet, and the Tennessee State team is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year college student, is in his first season with the Tennessee State team after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday before leaving the game he had five total hits, which brought him a total of 18 hits this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duties when they buy a property in the UK, raising additional cash to help the homeless under the new Conservative plans.
This move neutralizes the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in collar tax will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May is announcing today that foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy a property in the UK. The extra cash will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and high-income targets.
Increasing the stakes tax will be levied on individuals and businesses that do not pay tax in the UK, with additional funds supporting the government in its fight against sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and property for rent after purchase, could be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to bring in funding of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built properties will be bought by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get into the housing system.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" for a high number of foreign merchants, who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new strategy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut toll to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by fighting for land but not using it, and urged May to drop affordable housing quotas to correct Britain’s “shame on housing.”
Corbyn announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to evictions “without blame.”
At the same time, it wants to give committees more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my role to renewing the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
This means consolidating our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, we cannot allow that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy houses as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street remains too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which is currently in third place in the League One competition, three points from first place.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after moving with St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a baseball cap and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
“But as a child, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father and that’s something that has always drawn me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I am successful in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic team says he has no fear of following such acclaimed names in such a large club, having previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success will be measured by ‘being able to bring this club back to the Premier League.’
Due to the structure and equipment, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“Getting there is not an easy task, but I would probably consider myself successful if only I could get the club there.”
Ross is only three years in his management post, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month shift as head coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from their descent into the third league and changed the St Mirren team from the edge of the descent to the winners of the championship title the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled as he joined Alloa.
“I really believed that management was more suitable for me than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did well, I ensured an adequate standard of living, and I enjoyed some reasonable maxims.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still do it when it comes to stress and pressure at work, but I feel good in management.
I’ve always wanted to drive and now I’m doing it, making me feel like I’m in the right place like I’ve never been in my entire adult life.”

The analysis reveals that the perfect time for a glass of beer is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer heats have boosted sales at British taverns struggling to survive, but put pressure on restaurant chains.
The data revealed that the cramp and bar sector saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant sales declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business advisor who compiled the data, said: “Continuing sunny weather and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar trend as the previous month, June, when sales grew by 2.8%, with the exception of restaurants that were hit harder.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurant services in June only worsened in July.
Guests with drinks and a bar fared much better than restaurants that saw a decline when the same factors were taken into account.
Taverns offering food also saw a decline, albeit not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Apparently, people just wanted to go for a drink.
Within the controlled spasms and bars, beverage sales this month increased by 6.6%, while food fell by 3%.”
RSM leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to domestic sales.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales will be particularly painful given ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come for operators offering food at a worse time, and time will show whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will provide much-needed relaxation.”

One in Five Kids Has Secret Social Media Accounts They Hide From Their Parents
One in five children, some less than 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Instagram accounts”
Reports Raise Concerns That Sexual Content Is Being Published
Twenty Percent of Students Say They Have a “Main” Account to Show Their Parents
One in five children, some under the age of 11, creates social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of “fake Instagram accounts” – a photo-sharing page.
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of pupils said they run an innocuous “main” account that they show their parents, while also having a private one.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl urging others to rape her.
A survey conducted by the UK Digital Awareness Organisation and the Conference of Independent School Directors and Directors (HMC) found that 40% of the population aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online sites where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'voice of athletes' on Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who drive the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect among the Scottish, British and world athletics communities and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit by bringing her to the board of directors," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and together has four Olympic gold medals and is a regular BBC commentator, has had a transient ischemic seizure and is now unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It is exhausting work, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and today I am doing agility exercises.
Thanks for the encouraging news!”
Advertisement on a breast pump comparing mothers with cows divides opinions in the online world
A company that makes breast milk pumps has shared views in the online world with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers with dairy cows.
To mark the launch of the “world’s quietest wearable breast pump,” consumer tech company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a subhuman music video to showcase the freedom the new breast pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack filled with cows to a song that contains lyrics such as “Yes, I suck the milk, but you don’t see any tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, it’s not a wedge, it’s my breasts.”
The chorus continues: “I pump, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, suck out my beauties.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, opened up controversy in the online world.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked mixed reactions among viewers, with many saying it disparages the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to be able to make milk, except that we steal their babies within a few days of giving birth.”

Another user commented: “It is understandably traumatic for both the mother and the young.
But yes, why not use them to promote breast milk pumps for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, “Advertising ripped from reality.”
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song seemed "gifted".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy a suction pump if I was breastfeeding any more.
When I was milking, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I take it the way it is.
“It’s a great product,” one woman wrote.
Another user commented: “An entertaining advertisement aimed at moms who suck out milk (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.”
This is not advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all danced with discreet breast pumps tucked in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on understanding the essence that many women who suck their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, which gives women freedom of movement, the ability to hold babies and even suck and spend time outdoors.
Ana Balarin, partner and mother at Early Childhood Development, commented: “Elvie’s breast milk extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between the expressions of women and dairy cows, we wanted to put breast milk extraction and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in a fun and expressive way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn’t the first time Elvis has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowska, using this product.
Hundreds of immigrant children peacefully moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased, although monthly crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and practices made it difficult to place children thanks to supporters.
Traditionally, the majority of supporters were illegal immigrants themselves and feared that they would jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by coming forward with a child claim.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adult members of their households would be required to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, chief immigration and customs officer Matthew Albence testified before Congress that the office had arrested dozens of people who had asked to support unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either supporters or members of the supporters’ household are illegal here in the country, and a large number of them are foreign nationals with criminal records.
So we continue to monitor these individuals," Mr Albence said.
Officials, who are trying to handle matters involving children more quickly, have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of detention and not after 60 days as per the previous standard, the shelter workers said.
Many will present themselves via video conferencing and not in person to present their case regarding their legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are classified as not eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to suffer anxiety or depression, which can lead to a burst of violence or attempted escape, shelter workers said, and reports that have appeared in the system in recent months.
Advocates said these concerns are increasing in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering are more overlooked due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to friends could cause the trauma many are struggling with.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who appealed to the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “we will treat them accordingly”.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over in Syria." More than 360,000 people have died here since 2011, while millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until it clears all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in a war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee question, Moualem said the conditions were suitable for their return and blamed “some Western countries” for “spreading irrational fear” that led the refugees to stay away from home.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction assistance for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity for political talks to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has deterred a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra-al-Qaeda-linked front, who would be "removed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene early meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the group’s work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” and warning against interference.
Why Trump is getting a second term
With this logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020, even though a number of liberal viewers are likely hoping his presidency will end the indictment and scandal prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential finale ever!”
So far, there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, the average viewership in mainstream time on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and on MSNBC it has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in mainstream time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen said, and the "Show with Rachel Maddow" on MSNBC has a top rating of up to 3.5 million viewers on mainstream news nights.
“This is a beacon that attracts people because it’s not something that we understand,” Neal Baer, creator of the drama program “President in Order,” told ABC about a government secretary who would become president after an attack that would destroy the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy and show author of Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
Before the 2016 election, he remembered driving a taxi in Boston.
The driver told her she would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "because he's funny," Scovell told me.
There is a fun value in this chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the stories coming from Washington may determine the future of Roe v. Wade’s dispute over whether immigrant families will manage to reunite and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
But it’s beyond an informed citizen to find that you’ve been following a six-hour conversation by a group of experts about a “deeper background” as the source of Bob Woodward’s “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a rough piece of clothing with arrogance,” according to the Washington Post’s Mr. Storma Daniel) and the implications.
I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“Part of what he does is reminiscent of a reality show that feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the “Pawn Stars” series about Trump’s day-to-day broadcast with a recurring part of the show and everyday plots.
You can't afford to skip one episode because you'd be lagging behind.
When I came to see Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny 26 degrees outside on the north bank of Kauai, but he stayed inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn’t shake it, not with Brett Kavanaugh standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was just a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

The money from outside flows into the election for the chair in the middle of the term
Unsurprisingly, the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts, which resulted in two contestants fighting for one seat.
Pittsburgh’s recently redesigned suburban district stands in opposition to Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another Republican official, Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were rewritten after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The fight in the new 17th district affected the funding of the campaign between the party's main financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a widely watched March special election for the 18th congressional district in Pennsylvania.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a slight head start.
U.S. Considers Penalizing El Salvador Instead of Supporting China
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a slight departure from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until the partners moved Trump’s management organization team.
U.S. foreign ministry officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic mission chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions that are no longer recognized by Taiwan," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were taken into account only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to build on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administrative officials made it clear that they want the conference to move forward and effectively end any assessment of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now discussing the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance of the assembly, which the administration attaches to him, diplomats said.
Three U.S. ambassadors have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new serious news or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of Mr Bolton’s debate, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study history.
Another unexpected event could be a report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller about a possible obstacle to President Trump’s justice, of which there is now very substantial evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly turning his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign was linked to Russia in attacking our election.
If Congress changed sides, Mr. Trump would face responsibility in this body just as he prepares to go before voters and perhaps a jury of his House members again.
That’s a lot of conditions, if I don’t imply that the fall of Trump is inevitable – or its equivalent in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice about how it can affect the length of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, but this would have to be resisted by the West and supported by the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflection points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are now facing several of these inflection points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the report reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated about his incompetence to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' explanation is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if it is accepted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote mid-term in a congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be put to rest for a long winter's sleep.
I believe we will not fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles on the Sabbath on that table with the hook cross.
With a past like this, I just have to be optimistic.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers feels optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians following an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season, up to a 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game and we believed we could get something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could have made it to success in the end, but overall the draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we did more in the second half and were a better team.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it’s going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the fans behind us, I’m sure we can push on them and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough given my injuries and changes at the club itself, but now there is a factor in why we feel good.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it, we have a great training.
Let’s hope we push last season to the back and we will be successful.”
Women do not sleep because of fears associated with retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few people spoke to their family members.
Approximately half of the individuals in the nationwide study said they talk to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want to be looked after by a family member, but they won’t take steps to talk,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here is the point where we need to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t present your wishes to them in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you figure out a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in a crisis.
Get a health care attorney to designate a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure the professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the power of a legal representative for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and arrange for the payment of your bills if you are ineligible.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs immediate medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just about the money, it’s also about who the doctors are,” Martin asked.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep this plan in place.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in the strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to paralyzed communications, humanitarian officials were unable to obtain any information from the Regent’s office in Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palo since the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency stretching more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, an administrative region belonging to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main backbone of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite Sulawesi coast.
According to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, the cities of Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck the western part of the city of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies seismic in the Pacific Circle of Fire, and earthquakes strike it regularly.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami on 26 December, hitting 14 countries and killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake strikes southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that strikes the southern coast and kills nearly 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, capital of West Sumatra province, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, outside Sumatra, and triggered a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidia Jaya's regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested and charged with assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released by the Alaska State Driving Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when his acquaintance tried to call the police to report the crimes, he took her phone.
Palin remains in custody at an investigative facility in Mat-Su and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, the KTUU television station reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded “not guilty, for sure,” the TV station said.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and receive a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punished with one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while in a state of intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not functioning, with an increase in the number of deaths expected in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been handed down for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented Home Depot truck on Oct. 31 to carry out an attack on a cycling route along the West Side highway in lower Manhattan by hitting pedestrians and a cyclist on the route.
According to the announcement of the opening of the death penalty proceedings filed in the southern district of New York, if prosecutors want to achieve the death penalty, they will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious injuries.
Both of these charges are subject to the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, which included eight counts of blackmail-intended murder, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and cold-blooded thinking,” prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as “abhorrent, cruel and perverse.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadto, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuc."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s Southern District last handed down the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug vendors, but in September 2009 he was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the married couple had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in court documents in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he had a good feeling about what he had done, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipov said he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he had also asked for an ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to call for the death penalty instead of pleading guilty and a life spent in prison without the possibility of release only prolongs the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MEP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit talks
During a protest at a Conservative conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to “stumble into an awkward situation” from Eurosceptics when a member of parliament, Theresa May, suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative councillor Peter Bone said in March in Birmingham that the UK would be “already gone” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May’s challenge to alleviate her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted by conservatives with a staunch view of staying, who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain a compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of perseverance and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue to seek an agreement with Brussels despite opposition – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr Bone said at a meeting of the Leave Means Leave group that he wanted to dismiss the Prime Minister.
He proposed to Mr Farage to take part in and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out,” he said.
A member of parliament for Wellingborough added: “I will stand for Brexit, but we need to remove the prime minister.”
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: “We did not fight in world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr Bone rejected the view that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins was also on the march and told reporters: “I’m simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Prime Minister is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for her, it is unpopular with our party and our activists, who are actually rioting the streets and putting us first.
“Please let the Prime Minister go and start listening.”
She added: “Prime Ministers keep their seats when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the assembly that politicians must “feel anger” if they betray the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them we won’t let them.”
He added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel our anger.”
“We are mobilizing the people of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and we will never give up until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
In the meantime, people marched through Birmingham for staying and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
A number of activists waved a banner to the Conservatives against Brexit. The group was founded this weekend.
A Labour member, Lord Adonis, ridiculed the Conservatives on security issues with a party app at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can have information systems in place and all the technology for a friction-free border and for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to "think carefully" her candidacy for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will reconsider her candidacy for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a meeting of the city hall on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting at the city hall since Trump took office.
He asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time “for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that requires a woman in the top post.”
Arrest after shooting Sims at LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayden Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. at an ET press conference.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man caught on the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University boarding school early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result,” Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the 247sports network.
Wayde went to help his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being present, carrying a gun, and confessing to shooting Wayden Sims.
Simpson was arrested and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 2-meter junior player, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starters last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton nears world title after team orders brought him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes' orders will play a significant role in the race.
From his best starting position, Bottas got a good start and almost put Hamilton in an awkward position when he defended his position in the first two corners and challenged Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the boxes and allowed Hamilton to enter the group's tail, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxing stop a lap later and followed Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a close overtaking in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside with the risk of having to defend himself a third time after a double thrust.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row and was in seventh place until the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race, holding onto the road and focusing on a quick finish, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and reaching fourth place.
He eventually got into the boxes in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri worked fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman and let me pass by.
“The team has done an exceptional job, they have an exceptional combination of two strong personalities,” Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead noting that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “greedy, disgusting and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen, and that beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and greedy and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
When you look at the posts and the leaks and they say, “Oh, I didn’t do it.”
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make it public?
Remember her answer... you published a document – “oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t publish it.”
Okay, wait a minute.
We published... No, we did not publish,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and the letter was released in early September – but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t publish her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to.”
However, it seems that her denial did not sit well with the president, who said during Saturday’s assembly: “I’ll tell you what, that was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but she had the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of improper sexual behavior, the president indicated that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power by all necessary means.
You see mischief, indecency, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overcome in order to gain power and control,” Mediaite said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee Hockey team
The Dundee Stars compensated for a loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning a rematch on Saturday in Dundee with a score of 5:3.
The Giants took an early two-point lead thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Thanks to Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowny, the home team evened out, but Dwyer subsequently reinstated the leadership of the Giants.
François Bouchard matched Dundee, but then Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to ensure their victory.
It was the third loss of the Elite League season for the men of Adam Keefe, who turned the score and defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between rivals, when the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 a.m. assisted by Kendall McFaul and four minutes later assisted by David Rutherford when Beauvillier doubled the lead.
During the busy opening game, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt secured a settlement for Cowny at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants led the team to the first break when they scored their second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard scored again in a goalless game at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen secure Dundee's lead in the second half for the first time in the match, and he secured the victory in the half of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home in Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic operator dies to ensure plane with hundreds of passengers escapes from earthquake
An air traffic operator in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died ensuring the safe take-off of an airplane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after the great earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island on Friday and triggered the tsunami.
Severe earthquakes continue to plague the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat in a wildly moving swinging tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He stayed in place to make sure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision had saved hundreds of lives, Australian news agency ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palo.
“We were very saddened when we found out,” he added.
Meanwhile, experts fear that the number of casualties could reach thousands. The agency for disaster mitigation in the country says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is likely to continue to grow because many bodies were still under the rubble and we couldn’t reach many people,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reached up to six meters, devastated Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “A body is brought in every minute by an ambulance.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Pal on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earthquakes struck Indonesia earlier this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia: Air Niugini says one man missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline operating the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one man is missing after it said it had safely evacuated all 47 passengers and crew from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it found one man missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane collided with water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway began.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
“It was a great deal of luck,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to penetrate deep water to the emergency exits in a sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve the pier also helped rescue people by using an inflatable boat to bring people to shore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network databases suggest that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents in the last two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any accident.
Analyst determines the timeline of the night during which a woman was burned alive
The indictment ended Saturday in a reopened case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He plotted for the jury how he used cell phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When records showed that his phone was at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, Chambers, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday, confirming he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying because my car was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometimes after the death of Jessica Chambers, Tellis deleted her messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense plans to present its final statement on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the court to go before a jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Mindful Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook on this genre by filling their music with positive news.
The Bristol-based band The High Breed claims that hip-hop has shifted away from its origins in political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and re-popularize conscious hip-hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are experiencing renewed fame in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!?
New York babysitter sues couple for dismissal after ‘racist’ text message
A New York City nurse is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrectly sent text message from a mother who complained she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she found out that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"NIEEEEEEE, OTHER NEGRO," Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after the “shameful” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman realized her stunt, she fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that their outgoing nurse, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino woman instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home by Uber.
Ms. Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for dismissal and demands compensation of $350 per day for a period of six months, for the job with the employer for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that such things are not done,” she told The Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
A few defend themselves against claims of being racist and argue that leaving Ms Maurice's job was a sensible thing because they feared they could no longer trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told The Post.
“But would you give your children into the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
But go."
Comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail,” Plasco said his wife was only two months old and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Would you go after someone like that?
That’s not a very nice thing,” the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, the public quickly condemned the couple on social media, alluding to their behavior and logic.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Feared Readers Won't Have Relationship With Talking Bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to be in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to know what we now know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father was optimistic about rejecting his job. Before he got the idea and wrote a children's book about the little bear, he worked as a cameraman for the BBC. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "bitterly sweet" for his death last year.
She added that Paddington’s possible success, which she describes as “a very important member of our family,” was quietly proud of her father.
“He was a very quiet man and he wasn’t a praiser,” she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was early on like having a child who achieved something: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your doing.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, she and her daughter rushed to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"He called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad, that he wasn't expected to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me and told me that he would die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given to her by her doctors to keep her heart functioning were slowly fainting and leaving her system.
She died shortly before, and that's how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs Ednano-Laperouse, who is now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside the other passengers - regardless of the suffering she had suffered.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
I kept my head down and cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a tremendous sympathy for Hope.
I realized that she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Messages of mourning women prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have committed suicide for their loved ones try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place links to the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to experience what I have to experience every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up every room.
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling after taking his own life.
Ms Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that it will have a chain effect.”
Ms. Davis created the messages “to let people know that there are people you can come to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Davies' longtime friend, Mrs. Humphreys, lost Mark, a partner she had been with for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt bad or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
On Christmas Day, he was on a full day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't even look at them or anything else."
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to get through it: “It will create a hole across the whole family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as FBI opens investigation
"I thought that if we could really achieve something he asked for - a time-limited or limited investigation - we could agree on something," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission would "disintegrate" in the middle of the hurdle.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away on November 6 - if Republicans are not expected to succeed, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to get the man they elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call senators, lobbied to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI gets a report?
The Senate is currently sitting with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to change the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of deserters 'declining' under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 deserters last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors are tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by smugglers.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most will flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
North-South relations, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, representatives of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on suspended denuclearization talks.
This came after the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work on a nuclear-free peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said the lack of progress was due to U.S. sanctions.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh ‘Hysterical’, Says He’s Unable to Serve in Supreme Court
Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said his temperament was not fit for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke at the Texas Speech Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman did it, they would say she was ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking when discussing his family and high school period.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him a “grotesque and coordinated type of assassination” orchestrated by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Ms Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s testimony will prove that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he turns out to be biased toward Democrats.
“I think he’s being disqualified by these statements and the way he’s persecuting the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi spoke evasively when asked if she would try to indict Kavanaugh if his nomination is confirmed, and if the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only fit to be in the Supreme Court, he’s not fit to be in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or in the Roe v. Wade case because she considers herself a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh avoided asking whether he would reverse some Supreme Court rulings.
“Isn’t it time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Well, isn’t it beautiful?’”
Women have to control it.
It's a legitimate attack, months and years of rage that can't be contained, and she can't talk about it without crying.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she said that she also cried when she got angry, but she started using the procedure that when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I’m angry.”
And then she just kept going.
I think it's great."
Tears are partly allowed as a way out of anger, because they are extremely misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of an early job in a predominantly male office where I once cried out of indescribable rage is when an older woman, a cold manager I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me by the back of the neck and pulled me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re mad.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they got under your skin.”
Patricia Schroeder, a later Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart in his fight for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and ended his candidacy, a deeply frustrated Mrs. Schroeder realized that there was no single reason why she shouldn’t deal with the idea of running for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the game and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the campaign was long overdue, it was lagging behind in raising funds, so she promised not to enter the game unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her just $250.
“You think I’m on the left?” she wondered.
During her speech about not launching an official campaign, she was overwhelmed by so much emotion—gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism—that she shrugged.
“You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled of the press reaction.
“You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
“The one who cried?”
How a U.S.-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, the rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting items worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods arriving in the U.S. from China.
Beijing has paid back in the same way every time, with tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of goods falling lately.
China has promised to cope with U.S. tactics and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to retreat so soon.
Achieving a concession from Washington would mean succumbing to demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, a public bow to the US would be even more embarrassing.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its game well, U.S. trade war pressures could positively support China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a swift policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic turmoil in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than we’ve seen before,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for a New and Safe Think Tank.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild a country devastated by a more than seven-year war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in an interview with the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he does not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe confirms victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National golf course near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to overcome the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who failed in most tournaments, fired his first shot into the water on the 16th hole with par 3 and gave up his match in favor of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all of his laps and became one of four players to play 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth has been sacked by the lowest-ranked player in the European team Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell to 2 and 1 Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup tournament.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cup tournaments, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the record European winner of the tournaments with the number of points in his career 25.5.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I’m so glad the cup is coming back.
It's about the team. I'm happy to be able to help," said Garcia, emotioned after the European victory.
He handed over the baton to his compatriot John Rama, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods with two holes at the remaining hole in the individual game on Sunday.
“Defeating Tiger Woods makes me incredibly proud to have grown up watching this guy,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles in second place behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team fought all weekend to find the right path with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance in front of his team, “I’m proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning, the time has come when they have made the situation uncomfortable for Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an amazing captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will re-create the group, work with the American Professional Golf Association and the Ryder Cup Tournament Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I’m proud to have been captain.
Hats off.
You have defeated us."
Current status of red sludge: Concentrations drop in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission shows a general drop in red sludge concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Florida Commission, in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, uneven conditions have been reported in connection with the coating, suggesting declining concentrations.
Red mud extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee districts.
