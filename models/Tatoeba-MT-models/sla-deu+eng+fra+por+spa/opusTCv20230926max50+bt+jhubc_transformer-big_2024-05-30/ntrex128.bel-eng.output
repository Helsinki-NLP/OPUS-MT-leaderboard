Welsh lawmakers are concerned about what looks like puppets.
Some deputies do not understand why their parliamentary status should be changed to the status of "member of the Welsh Parliament".
Deputies were outraged over plans to change the name of the local assembly to the name "Parliament of Wales".
All political parties believe that this is a misconception.
One Labour MP said that his colleagues are concerned that it rhymes with the words “stupid” and “idiot”.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means “stupid”, and pwp means “stupid”.
She said her group was not satisfied and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss changing the name of the meeting, but noted that it was a brief verbal transition from a member of the Welsh parliament to a "puppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently developing a draft law on making changes to the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the deputies of the Assembly call, of course, will be a question of the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals that showed broad support for calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the additional deputy, the Commission preferred Welsh Members of Parliament or CNC, but the CMC option received the most support during the public consultation.
Additional lawmakers are obviously proposing alternatives, but the way to reach consensus could be a headache for the chairperson, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on change within weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the work of the Assembly, such as the rules on the disqualification of additional deputies and changes in the structure of the system of committees.
Additional MPs will hold a final vote on how they should be called when they are doing their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia" or against it.
The national vote was organised with the aim of resolving a multi-year issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
In Athens, they have long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor represents a claim to their territory, which prevented Macedonia's inclusion and membership in the European Union and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just a price to pay for joining the European Union and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The church of St. Martin is silent, the churches in Haarlem are fighting for the existence of
“Once upon a time, as the old people I talked to used to say, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
“Not here today, not here.”
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“The people have different communication and relationships nowadays,” he said.
"The bars are no longer cozy local lounges where people go all the time."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for such a long period as leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
Churches, he added, can be replaced by residential houses with condominiums filled with people who will not help the churches that will remain in the district.
“The vast majority of residents who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so it will speed up the day when these churches close together because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these condominiums will become parishioners of these.”
Both churches were built by a community of whites before Harlem became a black district – the Church of the Metropolitan Society in 1870, the Church of St. Martin – a decade later.
The original white-methodical community departed in the 1930s.
The black community, who prayed nearby, received the right to own the building.
St. Martin's Church was seized by the black community under the leadership of the famous John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of traders at the main shopping mall on 125th Street in Haarlem, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but the faithful under the leadership of Father Johnson planned reconstruction: they put into operation the carillon.
The illustrious David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the Corylion "names of poor people".
The expert, who played the carillon in July, called it differently: "Cultural treasure" and - "indispensable historical tool".
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world's first black-skinned musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago switched to the larger Riverside church.
Mr. Merivezer said that he was not replaced in St. Martin's Church.
What happened in St. Martin’s Church over the past few months was a complicated story between architects and contractors, some of whom were attracted by false church leaders, others by the diocese.
The assembly of the faithful – the governing body of the parish, consisting of the chaplain’s assistants – wrote to the diocese in July with the warning that the diocese is “trying to shift the costs” to the assembly of the faithful, although the assembly did not participate in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the eparchy.
Some people complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy has been paralyzed by a shark while diving to catch lobsters in California.
On Saturday, a shark attacked and paralyzed a 13-year-old boy who was hunting lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming, begging for help, and then swam with the others to help pull him out of the water.
At first, Hamel thought it was just the excitement of catching lobsters, but then he “understood that something bad had happened: ‘I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
"All his collarbone was torn," Hamel said, adding that he noticed this when he approached the boy.
I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: “In the water near the shark!” – added Hamel .
The boy was transported by air to Reidy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that the shark had been spotted at the site a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe species.
Giles added that the victims suffered injuries to the upper torso.
Officials have closed approaches to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Essinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening departments with beauty goods in department stores where trained professionals will work.
As part of the significant promotion to the British beauty market with a turnover of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, while sales of fashionable clothes and household goods are declining, larger beauty houses will be presented in 11 year-end salons in the country and also in other countries.
The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets are looking for a way to fill space on shelves that used to be occupied by TVs, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury's has said it will double the volume of beauty products by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will appear for the first time.
The existing assortment from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in brand departments similar to those found in stores like Boots.
Large stores are also relaunching their Boutique cosmetics line, so most of the products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is becoming increasingly in demand among young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and the second will open in Sally-Oak (Birmingham) later this year.
Online shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of products every day in local stores near the house leads to the fact that supermarkets have to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coupet, Sainsbury's chief executive, said the outlets would be more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with Aldi, Lidl's distributers with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also placed several Habitats outlets since it acquired both networks two years ago, which it says has boosted food sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
A previous attempt by supermarkets to rebuild their beauty departments and pharmacies did not end successfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but an attempt to share revenue from pharmacy stores ended after a series of dismantling in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business along with 281 Celesio stores to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy chain for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It was stated that Lloyds played its role in this regard by expanding the range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We have changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in the training of our employees, who will be able to offer their recommendations.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient location make us the best home of beauty, which resists the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones became furious after Holly Willoughby turned down the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has been pissed off after TV presenter Holly Willoughby turned down an 11-million-pound deal with his image-of-life brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
In Willoughby, there is no time for branding home products and Truly accessories.
The couple's business has become similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now parting with his lucrative branding business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was furious when the "golden" TV girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe (Backinghamshire), that her new deals are worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The business was similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand and was doubled to double Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: Truly was Holly's top priority.
It was her long-term future, which she would see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left all the participants utterly stunned.
No one wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday, very soon had to start dinner.
Marlow Headquarters has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the care of the leading This Morning, which is one of the most significant British stars, can cost the company millions due to huge investments in a variety of goods – from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, as well as because of the possible delays.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and husband Dan Baldwin were close with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for a decade.
Willoughby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the chairmanship in March.
The couple are vacationing together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television firm.
Willoughby will become a representative of the M&S brand and will replace aunt McPartlin as the leading ITV “I am a celebrity”.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We will not comment on his case."
I’m so sorry, we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for his comment, which is considered "non-presidential" for the fact that it speaks positively about the North Korean leader.
Why is there so much to be said about President Trump?
Trump said his parade "dictator" voice.
“I’m not going to give up.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on denuclearization have come to a standstill.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Lee Yong-ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North was not waiting for “appropriate measures” from the United States in response to North Korea’s previous disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
"We are very successful in building relations with North Korea," he said.
“It could have ended with a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the completion of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of the remains of U.S. troops home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be on the president’s side, but instead of 10,000 people trying to penetrate this crowded arena, we’re already going to have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been resettled, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary condition for the provision of international assistance.
“Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it was a bit difficult,” Ms Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that Indonesia has always experienced, the country is still well prepared for the surprises of nature.
Although there have been shelters built in Ache, in other coastal settlements there are almost no shelters.
The apparent lack of sirens to warn of the tsunami in Palu has led to more casualties, although there has been a warning.
Even in the best of times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia was a difficult task.
Natural disasters have made it more difficult to move.
The hospital vessel, which was located on the Lambok for the treatment of earthquake victims, is approaching Palu, but the journey to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widoda focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's shattered infrastructure and spent money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding is haunting the Jock administration, as there will be new elections next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of prolonged interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority embraces a more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool pushes the ball far against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, equalling the number in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stardge received a transmission from Jordan Shakira when they were about 30 metres from the Chelsea goal fold, which led 1–0.
He made a feint with the ball to his left before making a shot at the far rod.
The attempt ended by scoring high under the top bar when the ball flew into the top right corner of the net.
As a result, the ball flew over the head of Capa Arisabaloghi, jumping directly into the net.
“He was just trying to get into this position to kick the ball, and players like Shack were always trying to kick as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible,” Starridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was running, made an easy pass, not thinking too much about it, and just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1–0 in the second half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The attacking "blue" in this match made a pass to Mateo Kovacic before returning to the midfield zone and running to the half-field of "Liverpool".
Quickly, the stove was in the center of the field.
He then made an impressive shot, passing the ball to Azar at the gate.
Hazard circled the defender and broke into the lower left corner near the far rod past Liverpool goalkeeper Alyson Becker.
Liverpool competes against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Sao Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meets with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Disaster Management Agency said on Sunday morning.
At a press conference, the representative of the agency Sutop Purwo Nugroha said that according to reports, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5, which occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 7 meters in height.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was flooded with debris from demolished buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after he stabbed a woman.
The murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with gunshot wounds in the Grayson-Muse area of John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called on people from the area who had seen or heard anything to contact them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead or saw or heard anything suspicious and ask them to contact us.
I also encourage everyone, in particular the taxi drivers, whose DVRs may have made some video, to contact us, as they may have information that is extremely important to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
The woman's friends came to the scene this morning to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Muze, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his voice when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will be a few hours before they are allowed to return.
The police explained to one person that the entire area is now a crime scene.
The woman cried at the scene.
She said, “It’s so horrible.”
At 14:00, two police vans were in a fenced perimeter, another van was outside.
Several police officers stood inside the perimeter, exploring the apartment building.
Anyone with information should contact the police department of <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously at 0800 555 111, calling the record 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue was the last centurya memorable blow in the case of "rewriting history".
Its removal would be poetic justice for its Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, committed by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "During the current debate on the dismantling of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's monument near Westminster Palace would become the object of these actions.
The Iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the bad Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Mr. William Ham Thornicroft's vivid portrayal of Cromwell is a testimony to the thought of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe should still be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is known by many since the late nineteenth century, better than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation, the subject of a long historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually cognitive figure who represents one of the sides of this clash.
His achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve to be noted and honored.”
Pig murderer mutilated to death a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
“The man, known only by his surname – Yuan, was found dead with a torn artery and covered in blood, next to a barn in Lupanshu Market in Guizhou province,” the South China Post reported on Sunday.
The pork breeder was preparing to introduce the pork vaccine into the pig house on May 30, 2005 in Sinin, China's Qinghai Province.
He and his cousin are reported to have come from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said that there was a large blood on the stove.
According to the report, the forensic medical examination confirmed that a 550-kilogram mustache mutilated the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and damaged,” said a cousin named Wu (according to a quote from Guiyang Evening News).
A video from the surveillance camera showed Yuan entering the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent an attack on anyone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market administration are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although cases where pigs attack people are rare, but they have been before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in a man suffering serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer to his tractor and held it until his wife squeezed the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
“They’re just greedy.
They're very sensitive and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rose will bring heavy torrential rains to the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weaker as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, "Rose" will bring floods in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
The speed of the Category 1 hurricane Rose was 85 mph at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was recorded 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
"Rose" is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form an area of low pressure, moving east to the west coast of the United States. If on Monday "Rose" approaches the peninsula of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm.It will begin to push halfway to the US deep
On Monday, "Rose" will bring to some parts of Mexico up to 10 inches of precipitation.
Then the tropical moisture, which interacts with the approaching low-pressure area, in the coming days will cause heavy rains in the southwest.
In places from 1 to 4 inches of precipitation will cause dangerous sudden floods, rural currents and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will result in precipitation spots reaching 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially most of Arizona, rainfall is expected to be between 2 and 4 inches.
Due to the ungrouped areas of tropical rains, a sudden flood is possible under the condition of rapid deterioration of conditions.
It would be very undesirable to go out on foot in the desert due to the possibility of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to turn into raging rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by gusty winds and dust.
The incoming low-pressure area will bring heavy rain to places off the coast of Southern California.
Possible cumulative rainfall of more than half an inch can lead to a slight flow of garbage and make slippery roads.
This will be the first summer of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before raining everywhere at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread in the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, there may be strong temperature changes in the United States, as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to a sharp change in temperature in the near future.
There is a good example of a sharp drop in temperature in the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City (Missouri), and Omaha (Nebraska), St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to intensify and expand again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern states of the United States will begin a warm October with temperatures of 80 degrees – from the South Plains to parts of the North-East.
Temperatures in New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Bret Kavanaugh's hearings.
More than 20 million people across six television networks watched the interesting testimony of witnesses Thursday in the Supreme Court in the case between Brett Cavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, which allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political confrontation continues, broadcasters interrupted their regular programs in favor of emergency news on Friday: an agreement developed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it consisted of conducting a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunken Cavanaugh had grabbed her and tried to pull off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a statement that he was 100% sure it wasn't.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.
The company calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems with the assessment of people watching TV in offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing in the playoffs or the Oscars.
“Fox News, whose experts strongly supported the appointment of Cavanaugh, managed all the networks on average with 5.69 million viewers throughout the day,” Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
“CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million,” Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearings.
Flake was the main character in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in support of Cavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when protesters shouted at his address and when he tried to climb the elevator for a hearing at the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes when he was bullied, and it was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, “You have power, but many women have been deprived of it.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the committee hearings.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcasting live for several hours when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the nomination of the Candidate of Kavanagh under the quorum of the Senate.
But Flake said he would do so, only realizing that the FBI would review the charges against the candidate next week, which is what minority Democrats are calling for.
Flake was persuaded in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talks with Kuns and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's election was valid because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh at the FBI.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'game in politics' over Brexit
During an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics that she plans to leave the European Union, that they are "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party's conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In one interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper was her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who opposed her so-called "conspiracy" Brexit plan, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EU should have single tariffs was "completely absurd".
The murder of Wade Sims: The police arrested the suspect in the death of LSU player Daithen Simpson.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
“20-year-old Daytheon Simpson was arrested and put in jail on charges of second-degree murder,” the Baton Rouge police said.
Officials showed a video of the shooting between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the shootout.
“Police took the glasses from the scene and said they showed Simpson’s DNA,” CBS’s WAFB said.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to the death shot at Wade.
“The value of the deposit is set at $350,000,” Advocate reports.
The Eastern Batan-Rouge administration published a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police Task Force Department, the state police's criminal lab, and the Southern University Police Department are asking residents of the area for help in an investigation that would facilitate arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Alieva, thanked the law enforcement agencies of the district for their "precaution and striving for justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the Louisiana University team.
On average, last season he scored 5.6 points, 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, Louisiana University basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what I'm always worried about," Wade said.
The volcano erupts ash in Mexico
The ash erupting from the Papacatépetl volcano has reached the southern areas of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday asked Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was active and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions were reported within 24 hours.
There was a noise in the center and there were rumblings.
Images on social media showed that in the surroundings of Mexico City, such as Sachimilko, there are thin layers of dusty coating on the car windshield.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the south-east of the capital after the earthquake of magnitude 7.1 in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence supporters clashed with police to protect public order, and thousands of others joined in a demonstration to mark the first anniversary of the polarization vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked separatists, who were held back by public order police, threw eggs at them and bloomed with powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, the fighting broke out as police used their clubs to deter the demonstrators.
For several hours, groups of independence fighters chanting "Don't forget, don't forgive" encountered present trade unionists shouting "Long live Spain".
According to the local press, 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions in the independence-seeking region remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal but noted by Catalan separatists.
The overwhelming majority of voters preferred independence, although voter turnout was low, which was largely explained by the boycott of the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region as a result of the actions of angry demonstrators.
The pro-independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to take a different path.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician attending a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes for Catalonia's independence.
“We’ve had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we are tired,” he said.
Despite a vital but minor victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to keep up this year's momentum with many of their best-known leaders and have found themselves either in detention or in exile.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puch, who is recording a police-supporting protest on his phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting tougher,” he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in custody since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Being nominated as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we have seen on the part of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after ramming a house in a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car repeatedly crashed into a house in London.
The incident took place in the Belinagard-Crescent area on Thursday around 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, a bullet may have been fired at the vehicle.
As a result of Mango's hit, "Livingston" wins over the Rangers with a score of 1: 0.
The first goal of Doli Mangi in favor of "Livingstan" ensured them a victory
The success of Livingston stunned the Rangers, and this was enough to assign Steven Gerrard after his several defeats in 18 games to the post of manager of Ibrox club.
The hit by Doli Mangi was excellent, as Gary Holt rose to the same level as Hibernian in the second division.
Gerard's team this season will not win away in the Premier League and next Sunday will meet with the leaders, the "Harts" team, which are behind by eight points.
Prior to this, the Rangers in the Europa League hosts the Vienna Rapid on Thursday.
“Livingston”, meanwhile, continued its win-win series in the division to six games, and head coach Holt still feels defeated after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingstan" misses chances because of rough visitors
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they killed, but this direction caused the Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but lost his chance to score in the goal, after which Alan Litgov was only able to direct his efforts wider to meet the blow of Craig Hulkett.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could disturb guests at some points.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
On the Rangers side, a penalty kick was allowed, and Livingston made their debut, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to overcome Menga, who made a pass and scored from the center of the field.
By this point, the Rangers had dominated, but it turned out that the team's defense was unfit, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was practically uninvolved.
The same thing happened in the second half, although Alfredo Marellos really saved Kelly.
The ball from Scott Pittman was rebounded by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov moved away from the second set of Livingston.
The balls consistently hit the Livingston goal and were beaten back, while two penalty kicks after Halquet was called on to replace Glenn Middleton, and a penalty for playing by hand, were rejected.
“The Phenomenon” from “Livingstan” – analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alesdeir Lamont in the arena Tony Macaroni
Fantastic performance and results for "Livingstan".
For men, they were wonderful, continuing to exceed expectations in this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition has hardly changed since their return to the top echelon, but it is worth paying tribute to Holt for how he has stimulated the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hulkett was grandiose, building a well-organized defense, while Menga held Conor Goldson and Joe Warol all over the field.
The Rangers weren’t inspired.
No matter how good they were under Gerard, they did not meet these standards.
In the last match they did not possess the ball, only once scoring in the goal, which was something like an alarming call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the list.
A mixed attitude towards Erdogan in Cologne.
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and senseless flutters when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They quarreled over human rights issues, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
It is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police relied on security to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also voiced their views, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The pros and cons of the protests reflect disagreements about the guest, which some German Turks declared a hero, and others condemned as an autocrat.
A car accident in Deptford: a rabbi was killed in a collision with a car
He was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 British time.
The driver of the car stopped, the medical staff arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another farmer was killed in a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
Police said they were working to identify the man and report him to his closest relatives.
There are road fences and bus stops near the place, and motorists were advised to avoid this area.
Prison "Long-Lartin": Six employees injured during riots
“Six prison officials were injured as a result of riots in a prison of strict regime for men,” the Penitentiary Directorate reports.
The riots broke out at the Long Lartin prison in Worcester around 09:30 British time on Sunday and continue to this day.
To combat the riots, in which eight prisoners were held in one wing, the special group "Tarnada" was attracted.
At the scene of the incident, the workers were treated for minor injuries.
A representative of the Penitentiary Service said: "Specially trained prison staff was sent to fight those who committed the disorder in the Long Lartin prison.
Six of the patients were treated after receiving the treatment.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars.”
The royal prison "Long Lartin" contains more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was being treated in the hospital after the attack on the prisoner.
And in October last year, public order police officers were summoned to the prison to deal with serious riots, during which employees were attacked with water polo balls.
Hurricane "Rose" threatens the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with severe floods (which can be useful for arid regions)
Tropical hurricanes are rare in Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week because there are traces of Hurricane Rose in the southwestern desert that pose the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service on Monday and Tuesday released data on sudden flooding in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, and Las Vegas.
It is expected that on Tuesday "Rose" will go straight through the Phoenix, approaching with rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or pressure drop within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts precipitation from 2 to 4 inches, while in some places the level can reach 6 inches in the Magalhães area of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with individual resulting values reaching 4 inches.
For those at risk of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rose could be a long-awaited event, as their region is suffering from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be useful because the southwest is currently experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Agency, at least a little over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing an extreme drought of the second category,” according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rose leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore will subside.
In Mexico, a tropical storm is expected to cause rivers to leave the shores during the day or in the evening on Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico can be severe, creating a significant risk of flooding.
“A total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected from Lower California to northwestern Sunlra, where rainfall is possible up to 10 inches,” weather.com reports.
The Rose will then move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical pressure drop, which will then continue to move through Arizona and southern Utah until Tuesday evening.
"The main danger is expected from Rose or her remains, these are very heavy rains in Lower California and in the northwest of Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and rugged streams and landslides in the mountainous area.
Midsomer Norton attack: four attempted arrests
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with multiple stab wounds in Somerset.
Three teenage boys were found wounded in the area of Terrace Excelsior in Midsomer Norton about 4 o'clock on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in a "stable" condition.
“A 17-year-old boy and both others, 18 and 20, were arrested at night in the Redstock, Avon and Somerset districts,” police said.
The police appealed to anyone who could have any evidence on their mobile phone of what had happened to move forward in their search.
“Kavanaugh is swept away by the wrath and wrath of the Democratic Party,” Trump said.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to overturn the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, East Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was “suffering from the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party during the process of his nomination for the post.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying allegations that Christina Blasey Ford sexually assaulted her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearings on her indictment.
On Saturday, the president said that "on this day, the Americans saw a brilliant, high-quality and courageous character" Kavanaugh.
“The vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most perfect experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer with an excellent history of public service,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh, talking about the importance of Republican turnout during the midterm elections.
“Five weeks left until one of the most important choices of our time.
I’m not just late, I’m really late,” he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for the big candidates everywhere."
Trump does not agree that the Democrats have the intention of “resisting and obstructing”.
"It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the Senate level on the nomination of Kavanagh will take place no later than Friday," a senior assistant to parliament's leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims is increasing
“At least 384 people were killed, many people disappeared as a result of the influx of giant waves on the beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi,” the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday as waves six meters (18 ft) high hit the shore in the twilight, killing many to death and destroying everything in its path.
After the earthquake of magnitude 7.5, a tsunami occurred.
“When yesterday there was a tsunami threat, people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, and they became victims,” said a spokesperson for the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami dragged cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (up to 497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
According to him, some people survived only because they climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu centers.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were spinning and crumbling, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
Subsequent raids continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPTT) said the energy released by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroha called the damage "widespread" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found under the debris of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
“The casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala that is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake,” Nugroha said.
The communication in Dongal was “completely damaged,” Nugroha said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had been sent to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it could have been much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting the tsunami in Palu, but officials say the waves were coming at a time when the warning was made.
In amateur photos published on social networks, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building shouting desperately to people on the street warning of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water fell onto the shore, dragging buildings and cars behind it.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still very much needed food and other necessities.
The city's airport was only open for assistance and will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vida planned to visit evacuation centers in Palu.
As a result of the tsunami in Indonesia, more than 800 people lost their lives.
It's very bad.
“While World Vision employees from Danggala were successfully reaching the city of Palu, where workers are hiding in tarpaulins installed in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of devastation along the way,” said Mr. Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as relief groups began grim actions to launch disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers with deep knowledge were being prevented from going to Palu.
According to the Indonesian rule, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we will be able to open up for international assistance, but this status is not yet available.
On the second night in Palu, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing hoped that their loved ones would miraculously be among those who would leave the gloomy plot lines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was released from the hospital.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, and the body of her child was next to her.
Gendon Subandona, the coach of Indonesia's paragliding national team, prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students.
“Being senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Handon said that in the hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the paraglider community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to Palu participants who were at the beach festival.
His posts, however, were marked with one grey check mark, not two blue ones.
“It means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while replenishing ATMs in Newport on the Left
"On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee of Brink, who pawned bills at an ATM in Newport, Leva," the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money," wrote Det. Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, another man “run away because of Brink’s worker” and stole a bag of cash intended for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses noticed several suspects who left the scene, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity must contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye ("you").
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I am officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, nicknamed Ye, used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes take place on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was canceled for "emotional reasons", - said the creator of the show.
Along with the abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious meaning for him.
I believe “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it’s “you,” West said earlier this year, discussing the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
I’m you, I’m you, I’m you, I’m you, I’m you, I’m you, I’m you.
It came from "Kaney", which means "one", to just Ye" - a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he was leaning towards the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-worker, Jay-Z, also went without hyphens and capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's president-elect Andrés Manuel López Abrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, in Tlatelolco Plaza, López Abrador vowed "never to use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military shelled a peaceful demonstration on the square, which killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Abrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly grants to those studying, thus opening up more free places in state universities.
"Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups," he said.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for machine learning.
“As China becomes more active in machine intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount it spends on research in this area,” said investor and machine intelligence expert Kai-Fu Li, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about MI, even if there is no official MI strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, last year, China unveiled its plan: by 2030, it aims to be the first in the field of MI innovation.
“Doubling the budget on research in the MI area would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the US and we look forward to the next breakthrough in the MI area,” Lee said.
“Doubling funding could double the likelihood that MI’s next big achievement will be in the U.S.,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “The Superpowers of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive officer of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most well-known companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a machine intelligence system that defeated the most senior American player, Athelus, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China office in China.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency's Robotics Competition for Advanced Research Projects in Defense, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next windows.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get government grants,” Lee said.
“It’s not China taking away academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired luminaires from universities to work on MI in recent years.
Lee said a change in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"In my opinion, the green cards should be automatically offered to the candidate in the field of MI," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released a plan to develop the next generation of machine intelligence.
“The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in educational institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is below,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Machine Intelligence Center, which should involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And this month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced a $2 billion investment called AI Next.
As for the National Science Organization (NSF), it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in MI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, which sought to create a National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence, has not been monitored for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change their name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, which will resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked applications for participation in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory, and has vetoed NATO and EU membership.
In June, both governments concluded a deal taking into account the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Georgiy Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the turnout would meet the minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum.
The question of voting in the referendum suggests: "You are for membership in NATO and the EC with the adoption of the agreement with Greece".
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price to pay for admission to such bodies as the EC and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can freely live under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, Skopje.
Although it does not have mandatory legal force, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said they will take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name will require more than two-thirds of the parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no reports of violations were received by 1 am.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said the 62-year-old voter in Skopje’s capital, Jose Tanevski.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zarica and his son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ka voted for a referendum in Macedonia dedicated to changing the country's name, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and arranged chairs in front of the tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with our heads raised, not through the service door,” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have honor.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the overwhelming number will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result of “yes” would be “confirmation of our future”.
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Studies said that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel showed that 57% of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
For a successful referendum, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government since its arrival in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguera from Manchester City passes through the entire defense of Brighton
On Saturday, Sergio Aguera and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of defending against Brighton by winning Manchester City 2–0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aguirre made it easy.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field.
He raced between the three defenders of Brighton before hitting the open field.
Aguirre was in the midst of four green shirts.
He overtook one defender and overtook several more at the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed the belt to the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English striker with the first touch in the penalty area gave the ball to Aguero, who used his right kick to bypass Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan by hitting the right side of the net.
"Agüera has some problems with his feet," city head Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about how he played for 55, 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky to have him scored a goal at the same time.”
But it was Serling who gave the Sky Blues the original edge in the Premier League.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received this ball in the depths of the territory of "Breton".
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sein made a few touches before Sterling was able to reach the far rod.
The attacking Sky Blues aimed the ball into the net before it jumped out of the border.

Scherzer wants to play the role of "selecting points" against Rocky
After the Nationals were excluded from the playoffs, there was no particular reason to bid for a new start.
But the constantly competitive Scherzer hopes to take a hit on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff consequences for the Rockies remaining in the lead after one game with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Northwest.
The Rocks have won at least an unambiguous spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still hoping to get their first division title.
“Even though we’re playing just like that, at least we can handle the situation knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will be such that the game will probably be at the highest level of all I’ve encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?
The Nationals have not yet announced the start for Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to give Scherzer the ball in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was going to make his 34th start, held a session of the KPD on Thursday and will be on normal rest on Sunday.

Trump speaks in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the situation around his election to the Supreme Court of Bret Cavanaugh, talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big – I’m not late, but I’m really late, so I’m everywhere fighting for big candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain their power, using any necessary means, you see, – meanness, abomination.
They don’t care who they offend, who they have to kill to get power and control, it’s what they want, it’s power and control that we’re not going to give them.”
Hence, it is said that the deceased will “retreat” and “retreat.”
“And you see this over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, mean, disgusting and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the earlier recognition of Democratic group senator Diane Feinstein, who received a loud appraisal from the audience.
“Do you remember the answer?
Did you allow the document to be leaked?
Uh, that.
No, I don’t expect it – it was a very bad nonverbal language – the worst language I’ve ever seen.”
Work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It's impatience with those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to hurt me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs who are told that we are not welcome – all to express their opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar appeal because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, such issues on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In a statement after the meeting, which was held on Friday by the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party, it is said that "we want these meetings to be meaningful and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, that's what meetings were on Friday.
Unfortunately, today at most meetings the tone is not so and the promise of a "better, softer" policy has long been forgotten, if it really ever was.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not allowed in the Labour Party, and each opinion is evaluated from the point of view of whether it is acceptable for the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, because colleagues with whom I previously believed that I share the same political views, began to expect that I would take a step back and took positions that I would not agree with – on national security issues.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there is an imagery in social media calling for the election to be cancelled, condemning the center’s policy, saying that I’m no longer in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a stream of sexual or racist bullying every day, but are never evaded.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that adheres to different views, and with each movement of “incertitude” or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I have been given a lot of advice that urged me not to give up, not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my schooling in the school failed, I have been trying to defend the best public services for those who need them most – whether they need it or not.
I've never hidden my political views, including in the past elections.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
"For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that if a country is heading towards a Brexit that is hurting its homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour Party Leaders.
But in fact, the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my voters, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of cancellation of the election will be you and the political expediency will not prevent all of me from acting.

Air Melrose 38 - 17: The Invincible Air at the Top
The two later attempts may have somewhat said the final result, but without a doubt, Air deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Premier League match of Tennant.
They are now in the top of the table, the only side out of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, as well as their best chances that made them the hosts, coach Peter Murch had every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve still tried our games so far and we’re still invincible, so I should be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Pay tribute to Air, he dared more than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, transformed by Fraser Clima, put Ira in the foreground, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to juggle the numbers, and Jason Baggott failed to grasp the attempt.
Klimov stretched Ayra's lead with a penalty before, right in the break, he scored and then made a solo attempt, making Ayra 17-5 in the break.
But Melroves had a good start to the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Bogotá, reduced the lag to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Roarid Nott, which was stretched, and after the re-start, Air moved on through Stafford McDowell's attempt, realized by the Climates.
Air, acting as Captain Blair McPherson, received a yellow card, and once again Melrose forced another man to pay with the help of an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of February.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking Klimov out of the penalty area without a ball, McPherson landed behind Aira.
Klimov implemented his attempt, which he did again almost after the re-start, after Kyle Rowe was hit by David Armstrong in the penalty area and sent Flanger Gregor Henry to the field's fifth attempt.
Star Still Game seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant business
However, game star Ford Kieran is about to enter the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show he writes and stars alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the next ninth series will be the last in the show's series, and Kernan seems to plan to act further after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source at the Scottish Sun hinted that Kernan hoped to take part in the "flourishing trade in Glasgow".
"Our sea": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will again open the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Civilian buildings under the blue flag.
In naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto "The sea is ours by right" is drawn.
It's our duty to rebuild.
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may have peaked in recent decades as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calsadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICC's decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague, after decades of tense negotiations, will back Bolivia's statement that Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Eva Morales is a charismatic Bolivian president who faces a controversial re-election battle next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and that will change little, even if it does.
The United Nations, which is based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to make a decision on the territory of Chile and said that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes out only six months after the final arguments were considered, indicates that the case “was not complicated”, – said the Chilean expert in the field of international law Paz Zarate.
And far from advancing Bolivia's affairs, the last four years may have thrown it back.
“The problem of access to the sea was monopolized by the current Bolivian administration,” Sarat said.
According to her, the warrior rhetoric of Morales lost the residual Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but after that, it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velzte, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity “to put an end to 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Casadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as a political backbone.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“It’s an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen until they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
He spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the Singapore summit between leaders.
His comments come as the United States. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restoring nuclear impasse diplomacy with North Korean Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Ree says it’s an “unforgettable dream” that the long-running sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration if Pyongyang does not first take significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are calling for a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion shows, we saw the newest line in massive hats on the way to the stores in your cities.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely close the sun, you can no longer look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the podium many unusual headgear for their SS19 collection, which exceeded expectations from Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram won the popularity of impractical hats, the designers of which sent their creations to the podium.
A distinctive feature of Valentino was the luxurious beige hat, decorated with wide feather-like fields that filled the heads of the models.
Other accessories of an unusually large size included gem-decorated watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just before Halloween.
Many of the multi-colored masks were with sewn lips and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of them resembled a scuba diving school with a tube and safety glasses, and the other – similar to a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue to adhere strongly to the huge attributes of fashion, you're in luck.
Those who follow the style, predict that huge hats can break into our daily lives.
Huge-sized hats follow the heels to La Bomba, a two-foot-wide straw hat that can be seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was unleashed on social networks, contributed to another great creation on the podium – a straw beach bag, almost as large as the model with this bag, dressed in a swimsuit.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia edging and covered with a white leather handle, became an outstanding part of the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, “I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer has made a big impact, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have maintained their achievements in academic performance, continuing since 2018 with another excellent exam result, supported by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.”
This is a vivid reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of this year's final exams, we see that languages rank first in the league tables with the highest enrolment rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS participating schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher grade A in Chinese language learning, while 72 percent – those who learn German, 69 percent – also French, and 63 percent – is.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as a subject are now selected in the same way as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons employers cited for difficulties in filling vacancies, 17 percent were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming a necessity to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more promising jobs requiring language proficiency, these skills are becoming essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of which profession you choose when you learn another language, in the future it will become a real advantage if you have such skills for a lifetime.
The ability to interact with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in the first place among competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages taught in it.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK when looking to the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with a teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, languages are still vital to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and preference to Scotland's youth.
This has to be done
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts in San Diego on Sunday.
A start of waiting for fans eager to see LeBron James make his first start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play at Sunday's pre-season opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play, still need to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudel wrote that James is likely to play for a limited time.
According to a practice developed this week, James was asked about his plans for "six game pre-season schedules".
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump launches a plethora of company shares.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled speeches next week, including stops at friendly venues in Tennessee and Mississippi.
In confirming the vote on arrival to the election to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if votes are cast in November.
When does Trump's speech begin tonight in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia on the Internet below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to review this week's Supreme Court candidacy hearings for Brad Cavanaugh, who is having trouble with sexual harassment allegations, with an awaited confirmation in the Senate of a vote within a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main goal of these speeches is to help the Republicans who are facing the November election.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign announced that these five speeches next week are aimed at “intensifying the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reersut.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign official told Reuters.
Planned at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today’s event can attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media in Pittsburgh,” The West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the polls.
“It’s not a very good sign for Maurice that the president should come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team advances to fight to keep hope alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's four-day sessions may have been exactly what was needed for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sports concept that players sincerely believe in, and nothing more than similar competitions.
So where would they say the momentum now?
“They had an advantage of six points, and now four, so I think we’re going through this with a little impulse,” Jordan Sleep said, walking through the day.
Europe's advantage, of course, is four points ahead, and there are twelve more in the game.
Americans, Spitz says, feel like they've been slightly blown by the wind, and they have a lot to hope for, not least because of the uniform of Spitz and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and everyone can boast of three points out of four.
Spite was mortal from T-shirts to green and is an example.
These gargantuan shouts of celebration grew louder as his round lasted, and he drowned a decisive blow to play matches on the four-field as he and Thomas gave way two-by-two.
His blow, which allowed them to win matches on the 15th, was met with a similar shout, like the one that tells you that he believes the American team is not excluded.
"You just have to dive in and worry about your own match," Spitty said.
All of these players are gone.
18 holes to make a mark.
Over the past two days, the only players to have scored more points than Spite and Thomas are Francesca Malinary and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couples in Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Malliwood" were the only ferry that didn't make a bog on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bog on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday afternoon.
It happens and how their energy seems to flow to and from this tumultuous crowd and it confirms that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there would be no more popular player to close a potential victory in Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Mae.
Both are desired at the same time in different openings.
The talk of European glory is timely.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a brief work on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning buffet, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Boggi and the two twins on the front nine dug up the Spaniard and the Swede, from which they were never able to get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
Four-ball matches and quarters are so interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the pairings, the tips they give, the tips they don't follow, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has so far become the best team and took on a significant role on the last day, but this fourth meeting also shows that the US team is striving for a fight that some have doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe reaches the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe will get a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup after pulling out of Saturday's four-ball and four-to-one matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesca Malinara led the fight with two victories over Tiger Woods to sum up the results in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Byrne's European side, seeking to preserve the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the U.S. dissatisfaction agency in the morning, receiving a 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in a four-ball match, winning two matches, but they couldn't do more.
In order to save the trophy, Jim Fourik's side needs eight points out of 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Malinari, who was named Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in four goals, they made a great fix to defeat the downed Woods and American recruit Brian Decamb for another 5 and 4.
Woods, who played himself through two matches on Saturday, showed a random splash of shine, but now he has lost 19 out of 29 times in matches of four goals and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested on x matches of four balls, returned to partner Henrik Stansen in matches of four balls to defeat 2 & 1 True Johnson and Brooks Koepka – occupies one and second place in the world.
Europe did not have its way, although it was a pleasant, fresh day south of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time winners Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas set a checkpoint for the Americans with two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter of Spain in four-ball matches and returned later to defeat Puller and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in fours, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returned from a four-point deficit, which goes solo, although towards the Furyk owners you only need to draw to save the trophy.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if they will succeed.
North Korea says there is “no way” it will disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations is continuing sanctions that increase distrust of the United States, and under such circumstances the country cannot give up nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong-ho said at the annual General Assembly of the world body that last year North Korea took "significant goodwill measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test zone and promising not to distribute nuclear weapons.
“We don’t see any signs of a resurrection,” he said.
“Without trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way first and foremost to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
Despite the fact that Ri re-published the usual North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to dinuclearization, under which North Korea was rewarded, because it took gradual steps, his statement proved to be significant
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit of US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the path to “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
North Korea is seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the lifting of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States of America first insists on ‘denuclearization’ and increasing pressure levels through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, and even opposes ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri says.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an inescapable dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea were a participant in this denuclearization issue, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been such a tumult.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech differed sharply from last year when he spoke at the UN General Assembly, arguing that targeting the U.S. continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. President Evil” Trump called Kim a “missile” suicide bomber.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his boldness in taking disarmament measures, but said there would be much more to do and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are arguing in the UN. The Security Council said that it is worth rewarding Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “The implementation of Security Council sanctions should continue proactively and necessarily until we are sure of a full, final and verified dinuclearization.”
The Security Council stepped up sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the Security Council. The General Assembly then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying the progress made with North Korea over several hours of talks ended with a statement to Visa that he posed demands “like gangsters.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to eliminate the missile launcher and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
Trump said Kim said the “appropriate measures” he expects are a guarantee of security and a desire to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students take the course on the right rest.
Harvard University's new course this year aims to train students to sleep more, and aims to combat the culture of learning at night with coffee in hand.
The scientist came to the conclusion that students at one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to properly take care of themselves and their health.
Charles Chasler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, he began the course.
At the end of the lecture, one girl came up to me and said, “Why did they tell me this only now, in the last year of training?”
“She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep – it surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course, taught by the student, explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic achievement, as well as improve the overall mood.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health service, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were often deprived of sleep within a week.
The course, which lasts an hour, includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a room on the internet where students click on coffee cups, curtains and books that talk about the impact of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects sports performance, as well as the importance of bedtime habits.
At the next stage, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive images, invites participants to reflect on their daily lives.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students.
But we think they need to know this just as much as everyone knows about the health effects of smoking,” added Professor Chaysler.
According to him, the culture of night nights still exists, adding that modern technology and the constantly increasing pressure on students leads to sleep deprivation, which turns out to be an increasing problem.
“Ensuring adequate sleep of good quality should be a ‘secret weapon’ for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he said, “even to avoid excess weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler design the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to train everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all assistants to complete a similar study program before entering the university.
Professor Chaysler recommended that students have the opportunity to set a clock to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that is emitted from the screens of monitors and LED lights that can change the daily routine, which leads to problems with
"Livingstan" 1:0 "Rangers": Menga scores a goal for Gerard.
The Rangers suffered another defeat when Dolly Mangy's goal assured them that Steven Gerrard would not be defeated 1–0 at Livingston Stadium.
Ibrax wants to record his first victory on the way to a 4-1 triumph in February in St. Johnston, but Gary Holton's team is already taking a second defeat to Gerard as an 18-game manager to leave on their side eight points behind the leaders of the Ladbrokes Heart Premiership.
Mengo hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, did not look like they were suffering defeat.
At the same time as Rangers descended to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place, behind Hibernian with a difference in balls.
For the Rangers, there may be additional problems after the forward Colum Spence has to be treated for a head injury after he hit an object thrown from the stands.
Gerard made eight player changes, which is why Ira did not play in the semi-finals of the Batfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levy under the 11th number, which allowed him to pick up a point from the Hearts last week, and was delighted at how well they bypassed their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but Liverpool made more attempts to score the ball.
They should have scored within two minutes when Menghi first pointed the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, and then the midfielder took advantage of this opportunity.
Jacobs Kagan's successful penalty kick caught Craig Halkett's hand, but his defense partner Alan Litgow was able to deliver a strong blow from behind.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game more hoped to score than demonstrated a good game.
Alfredo Marellos certainly had to be fined a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Stephen Lawless collided on the field, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept Colombia's complaint.
The Rangers managed to hit the goal only in the first half of the game, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly almost scored a goal to Lasan Coulibaly and an effective attack to Ovi Eharia.
Although scoring the first goal in the 34th minute, Levy may have been against further active play, but no one denies that they have to demonstrate to the fans a good game.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to break through the Jacobs gate.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave a pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Menga for the opportunity to score at the gate.
Gerard replaced Coulibaly in the break with Ryan Kent, and this had an effective impact when the striker made his way to Marelos, but the impressive Kelly ran and blocked the shot.
But "Livingston" continued to please visitors, playing the game, which they liked, and Litgov and Hulket continued to share the ball after a long confrontation.
Holt's side was only able to prevail in the last minutes, but McGregor played well to stand up to Jacobs before Litgaw went to the bench.
Rangers' replacement by Glenn Middleton happened once again after a penalty when he faced Jacobs, but Tomson managed to evade.
Almanac: The inventor of Geiger's counter.
Page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and SUPPLEMENTS... the day of the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the emergence of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger's counter became a part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Called Carnation, which featured those seemingly little-known scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on headphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms given off by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, is this really shaking now?"!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system “see” cancer cells.
A new anticancer vaccine can help the immune system “see” bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine seems to train the immune system to recognize bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method involves obtaining immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then the cells can “see” the protein common in many cancer cells, and then re-inject the auxiliary cells.
The trial vaccine demonstrates successful results for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was given a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells saw that ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months.
The method involves getting immune cells into the patient, changing them in the lab so they can “see” the HER2 protein, common to many cancer cells, and then being re-injected.
This was stated by Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anticancer cells that fight breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers," said Professor Berazofsky.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and "teaching" them to achieve cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West began a discussion in support of Trump, wearing the title of MAGO, after his appearance in the SNL.
I'm glad it didn't turn out well.
In the studio during the evening Saturday evening, Kanye West was humiliated after a speech where he praised the United States. President Donald Trump said that he will run for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song on the evening called “City of Fame,” when he was in the “Make America Great Again” hat, he spoke out against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“How many times do I talk to whites and they say, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’”
“Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began a show starring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Bret Cavanaugh before a Senate court committee during the trial of Christina Blasey Ford's sexual assault case.
Despite the fact that the speech was not broadcast, West's words fell into the frame and were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if he's trying to get West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had a difficult time behind the scenes.
They came at me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out there with that hat.
They've attacked me.
“And then they say I’m in a bad place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner newspaper.
West continued: “Do you want to see the dead spot?” “Telling him” put on my cap of Scrumman, which meant that he couldn’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try to love.
Due to his statements, the hearings were suspended at least twice, and the representatives of the SNS were confused by the message from Veraiti. "The whole studio was silent."
West was adopted as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the Conservative Party of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the most courageous spirit Thank you for your support."
But Karen Hunter wrote on the talk show that West is just who he is, and that's always great.
“But I have decided NOT to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes, or by upholding his ‘art,’ which I believe embraces and promotes an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
Just like us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now his "official name is Kanye West".
He was not the first artist to change his name, and followed in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion and, of course, the legend of the music, who changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the artist, formerly known as the Prince.
Attempted murder in the restaurant "Belfast"
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was attacked in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balochistan, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast's court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of "Game of Thrones" Keith Harington embraced the idealized brutality.
Keith Harington is known for his flapping sword and the role of John Snow in the series "Game of Thrones" in the action medieval raw material HBO
But the 31-year-old actor was given a stereotype of a macho hero, which means that young boys often feel tougher for respect.
Speaking at the Sunday Times Culture Department, Keith said he believes “something has happened” and asked how to address the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones neighbor Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he feels powerful about solving the problem.
"I feel personally strong guy, - when we were wrong with courage?" - he said.
"Why are we going to teach men when they grow up, in terms of the attitudes we see now?"
Keith believes that television should be responsible for the appearance of brutality due to the very masculine characters.
He asked, “What is the first thing that comes to mind and what is the first thing that comes to mind?”
Why do they teach on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they need to be so confident to be a real person?
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of our time – how are we going to change this?
It's obvious that something is happening to young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that next summer the series will end, and he will step out of the battlefield of the series and will not make dots or sequels to "Game of Thrones".
From November, Keith will begin to revive True Western Sam Shepard, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a robber.
Recently, the actor reported that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best opportunity to complete "Game of Thrones".
“I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life is here,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the character who fell in love with the character of Keith Jon Snow in this fantasy series, awarded "Amy".
The couple got engaged in June 2018 at Leslie's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as was the case in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread to some areas of China as a result of infection through blood transfusions.
"However, the number of such people infected with HIV through blood transfusions has fallen to almost zero," Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people still exists.
Due to conservative values in the country, about 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases are spread by insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies data leakage, danger and conspiracy theory by her parliamentary staff
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that an employee posted personal information about three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia.
A Los Angeles Democrat has argued that there are claims against members of the far right and their sites.
“Lies, lies, and a lot of disgusting lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The published information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers in the U.S. Meaning. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown man on Capital Hill during a Senate committee hearing on sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court member Bret Cavanaugh appeared online on Thursday.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
“Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source’s IP address was linked to the Waters office and distributed information to an employee of the Waters team,” Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated assertion is completely false and absolutely false,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team, whose data, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
It is a falsehood, and a falsehood, and a falsehood.”
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Arya Fleischer.
“It’s annoying,” Fletcher said.
This shows that she does not have the courage to be a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They don't have to be obnoxious.
They should not question the motives of their accusations.
They need to be calm and calm.
Fleischer compared Wothers' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh when they were accused of being too splintered during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who runs and participates in midterm elections, also tweeted.
“This is the truth, this is the truth,” he said.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false statements.
“We guarantee that the perpetrators will be found,” she continued, “and they will take legal responsibility for all their actions that are disruptive and dangerous to any of my team’s employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again is a review of the fictional spy Rowan Atkinson.
Now it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new film with a British bias, and this bias seems to be in the comedy and action franchise of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and continued in 2011 under the title "Revival of John".
Is it possible for a satire to make a good statement about how obviously stupid we look when we talk about new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, the incompetent Johnny English was given the opportunity to make fun of things – his name was more loud than all the comic creations he had done for non-English viewers in cinematography.
It is known that he is a secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to glamour, turned out to be a bit like Clouseau with Mr. Bean's features and a bit of a taco guy who made a single note in the Choir of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
Originally, his character was based on the traveler and international mysteries of Atkinson, who once played the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos in his path.
There are a few good moments that haven't happened before.
I loved Johnny English, approaching the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the blades of the rotor a little knocking on his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for theatrical comedy is brightly demonstrated, but the humor feels weak, and so surprisingly, especially when serious films like Agent 007: Mission Impossible confidently offer comedy as the main part.
The humor feels like it's not just for adults, but also for children, and even Johnny English's stupid accidents are not as inventive as Atkinson's silent films in the face of Bean.
The UK's long-standing concerns are a major concern.
A cyber hacker infiltrates the super-secret community of British spies in the UK, revealing the names of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the duty agent – this is, unfortunately, a small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, who is a proud and mixed figure already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Theresa May, but there's nothing like that in the script.
Her intelligence consultants report that since every real spy will be exposed, she will have to involve some of those who are already retired.
And this means that for Johnny English himself everything is complicated: now he works as a sixth teacher in several chic institutions and gives lessons on how to be an uncovered operator: some good examples here, as English offers the Academy of Music lessons of espionage.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former longtime friend Bo, who is played by Ben Miller again.
Currently Bo has a marriage tied to a submarine commander whose role Vicky Pepperdine played a little in vain.
So Batman and Robin get terribly wrong things at the Queen's secret agency, where they work again, dating a beautiful woman, Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic tech billionaire who says he can solve problems with Britain's hackers: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their action with immediate things: disguise themselves as a waiter, set fire to a French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight smugglers aboard the luxury yacht Volta; English commits pure anarchy with the house, as he tries to use the virtuality of the room, as he tries to use the headset.
All the moments are drawn for the last event, but just as pleasant and noisy, in which there are quite a lot of children in the TV.
Pretty good material.
And as with other Johnny English films, I couldn't think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan to pay Britons a four-day workweek with a paycheck of as much as five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan if the British work only four days a week, but they are paid for five.
It is reported that the party wants the heads of enterprises to transfer to the workers the results of the work done as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, giving them an extra weekend.
It was obvious that employees will enjoy the three-day weekend, but will still receive the same salary.
The source notes that the idea is in line with the party's economic program and plans to send the country to support workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved the transition to a four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A planned review of the actions will be announced by the end of the year.
This is not going to happen now, but a four-day work week is an idea that fits the views of the party and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse such an idea, the Green Party promises to hold a four-day working week during a general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party's aspirations are generally not supported.
A representative of the Labour Party said: The four-day working week is not the goal of party politics, and it is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to express his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he had decided to return power from “ruthless directors” and “managers” to utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also stipulate that the current water shareholder may not receive the entire package of shares back, because the Labour government can make a "calculation" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed that it is planned to contribute workers to the boards of companies and create joint ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of the private firm's own funds to employees who will hold annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy told 60 Minutes that an FBI investigator working with Kavanaugh would have to change his mind.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Bret Cavanaugh has been postponed until the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week. The question arises whether the conclusions of the Bureau of Republican Senators will be able to provide support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Paley asked Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about “Sense”: Can the FBI reveal anything that could lead to change.
Kennedy appeared to be more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said, going to the trial: I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and asked the reason for the accusation, asking, “Did you do this?”
He was a stooge and a stooge.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be over.
“I think Brett Cavanaugh decided that this would be a scandalous accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denies it,” Graham added, referring to Christina Blasey Ford.
“And all those whom she calls were not able to believe this.
She's only 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the International Festival of Citizens and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City is the International Festival: an annual music event that has a very impressive composition of performers and performers and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Citizenship Festival will be held on a large lawn of Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the concert of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, as well as learn about the true goal of the event – ending poverty and hunger by 2030.
The International Citizenship Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project Against Poverty by an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a number of tasks or "spend a promotion", be a volunteer, write an e-mail to the leader of the country, call any other activists and raise awareness.
But how successful was the Citizens' Festival for 12 years and was it able to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a worthless concert a real way to convince people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” – people feel that they are doing a good thing by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the organizers of the festival have stated that they have recorded more than 19 million "shares" from their supporters who are striving to achieve different goals.
It says these actions have helped push influential leaders to commit to more than $37 billion in commitments that could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group submitted 390 comments on commitments and statements worth at least $10 billion that had already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include catering, partnerships with UK-based investors and contractors, “helping children develop in full”, a promise to provide Rwanda with more than $35 million after receiving $47 million in donations to help avoid escaping
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can eradicate the social injustice of malnutrition in history,” said Ambassador Tracy Ullman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 actions were held calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a “food aid” project that reaches 5 million women and children with food problems.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the site, "What makes you think that we can end poverty?"
The global festival responded: It will be a long and difficult way, sometimes we will suffer defeat and failure.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae – one of a number of persons who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be led by Deborah-Lee Farness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy for the "blockade" to prevent the export of Russian oil and gas
"Washington can, if necessary, appeal to the navy to prevent the entry of Russian energy in the EU and Middle East markets," U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zink said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, are grounds for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason for their stay in the Middle East is that they want to acquire energy in the same way as in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to cope with this.
“The United States has the ability, with the help of the Navy, to assure the openness of the sea routes, and if necessary, to organize a blockade so that their energy is not likely to enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia more or less balances and replaces fuel,” he said, calling Russia a “one-sided country” with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration employees, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “wrong” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth $ 11 billion, which is created to double the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's tough opposition to this project originates in the economy and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have a common view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Minister Rick Pera in Moscow in September.
The Americans were hit back by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has urged the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supplies,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss her participation in the 2020 presidential election very seriously, a Massachusetts senator says.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider her participation in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a speech in Halioki City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her participation.
“The time has come for women to head to Washington and bring order to our failed government, and I am also talking about women in the highest positions,” she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will very seriously consider the possibility of running for president."
During a speech in the city hall, Warren turned on President Donald Trump, saying that he was “leading the country in the wrong direction”.
“I am extremely concerned about what Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Cavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "It is known that before the vote, the FBI needs to conduct an investigation."
However, the results of a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the Center for Policy Studies at Suffolk University/Bostan Globe, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts “possible” voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The poll showed greater support from former Governor Deval Patrick, where 38 percent were in favor and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among Democrats discussed in connection with a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially make a decision by January.
At a rally in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Pauline mentioned the post-traumatic syndrome of track Pauline.
The 26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after being drafted to serve in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my son is going through after he returns, I can compare to the results of post-traumatic syndrome and the injuries our soldiers are returning with, in other families,” she told a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pauline called the arrest a “bally issue” and said that her son, along with other war veterans, “return a little different, hardened, returning with the question of whether there is that respect for which soldiers, pilots, other military, surrendering themselves to the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasila, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of attempts to report domestic violence, wearing a weapon in a drunken state, according to Dan Benet, a spokesperson for the State Department of Police.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new policy on harboring
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies harboring victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a memo on Friday in Washington to support the challenge to the policy of providing shelter, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was opened in August by the American Civil Rights Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and his friends from a brutal gang” raped her, but U.S. authorities refused to dock on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, of which the largest number of port requests come from the United States, as countries that have serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
A new U.S. harbor policy changed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Commission that allowed undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence to turn to the harbor.
Columbia County Attorney General Carl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of legislative experience of states, the country and the world."
"Federal legislation requires that applications for a haven be based on specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle," the analytical note says.
Lawyers also said in a note that policies that deny immigrants are worsening the U.S. economy, saying that often immigrants can become entrepreneurs and “create the necessary jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give shelter to victims of domestic and gang violence.
“Use is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or political views,” Sessions said on June 11, announcing the policy.
Refuge has never meant solving problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue work in Palu. During attempts to find survivors, the number of dead doubled
The survivors are in a very difficult situation.
"Everything is very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her young son with a fever in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the car "quickly" brings the bodies.
It’s very small water.”
Residents began to return to their ruined homes, dismantling wet things, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris, who broke his spine and shoulder, are outside the army's Palu hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to severe, recurrent thrusts.
There were tears in his eyes when he remembered the sensation of a strong underground thrust in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to go.
I was crammed under the ruins of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for marriage.
“I heard the woman calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they’re safe.”
US Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Threats’ Using ‘Propaganda Advertising’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page advertisement in the U.S. daily, praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned a paid app by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register – the state’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on November 6. This accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that China was trying to interfere in the U.S. election meant that U.S. officials in an interview with Reuters called a new phase in Washington's campaign to pressure China.
Although the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington have unleashed a trade war, the result of which was the mutual imposition of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, according to U.S. and Chinese experts, were imposed to harm exporters such as entrepreneurs from the state of Iowa who support Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural commodities to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in an author’s article in the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, “is now redoubling its efforts by printing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is making use of the good American tradition of free speech and free press by printing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstead wrote.
"And if you look at the newspaper kiosks in Beijing, then there you will find not so many votes against and will not see a real reflection of other opinions that the Chinese may have about the dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking into account the fact that the press is under the iron fifth of the Communist Party. "
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers refused to offer" to publish his article, although he did not name this newspaper.
Republicans are pushing back female voters ahead of the midterm elections from the Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
While many well-known Republicans are defending Supreme Court nominee Bret Cavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault accusations, analysts have warned they will be hit back, especially by women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this were very strong, and most Republicans have already shown that they are ready to vote.
“These things can no longer be brought back,” said Grant Richard, professor of political science at Maxwell University Syracuse’s school, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Richard said he was not sure that Senator Jeff Flake's statements about the FBI's investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and in November,” said Corinne Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokeswoman for Progressive Group MoveOn, a Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate lobby when Republicans controlling the Legal Committee decided to nominate Cavanaugh, despite a statement by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be extremely great," Stu Rotenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
“People say they’re already tall, and that’s true.
But there may be even higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's open statement, in which she detailed her accusations of a candidate in the Supreme Court of sexual abuse, analysts believe that if Republicans insist on confirmations, there may be a strong blow in response.
“For the Republican Party, this has become a mess,” said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether or not to get Kavanaugh to the post. It's about how the Republicans coped with it and how they treated it," noted news channel Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities of the USA, who helped groups
However, it seems that the Americans are divided on the issue of the right Ford or Kavanaugh, with a little more advocacy for the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are confident or not very confident in Ford's statement, and 35 percent said they are confident or not very confident in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believe Kavanaugh may or may have lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following a push by Flake, the FBI is investigating allegations by Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavanaugh, when he was drunk, pursued her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party when they were studying at Eile in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is built on the Berners-Lee Solid open platform.
Solid allows users to choose a place to store data and who has permission to access this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that by creating Inrupt, he meant "domination of the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a great moment.”
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create “own repository of data on the Internet” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, fan library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at once on the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to what type of information.
The company calls this "personal capacity enhancement with the help of data."
In the opinion of John Bruce, the company's CEO, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to bring together the resources, process and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers working on the contract project, and coding volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said he and his team had not spoken to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a full change when all of their business models would be instantly revised.
“We don’t want to torture them.”
In Saturday’s publication on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission “is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in advocating net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Honoring a Priest Awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only priest of the Anglican Church, awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I as a participant in battles, was celebrated in his city 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Van was awarded on September 29, 1918, for his participation in the attack at Belenglise and Leacourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper bullet and never learned that he had received the highest British military award.
On Saturday, in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of his grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wang, said it was “very symbolic” that the stone opens exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Wang led his battalion through the Canal de San Quentin "through a thick fog and under the heavy gun and machine gun fire of the enemy."
Then he ran to the line of fire and "with great courage" led the soldier forward, independently grabbing the gun and knocking out three units.
Lieutenant Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later the war ended.
The 72-year-old Michael Wang said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do and also something worthy of respect.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Wang, also laid the wreath after a council led by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Wang said it was "a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero has been demonstrated by the support that many have shown."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, they instead got a Peppa Pig
Just imagine you've been lagging behind all night to watch the packaged transmission of Bellator 206, and then you're denied access to the main event.
The program from San Jose had 13 fights, including six on the main map, and they were broadcast live all night on the British channel Channel 5.
And at six o'clock in the morning, as Gerard Moussassi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the clash, viewers in the UK were simply frenzied when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night deliberately waiting for this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter called the switch to a children's cartoon as "someone's stupid joke".
Asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said: “According to the state decree at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and needed to switch to a children’s program.”
"Yes, Peppa Pig."
Bellator CEO Scott Cocker said they would be working on a program in the future to cater to British viewers.
“I think we’re going to discuss the possibility of a repeat, I think we can resolve this issue,” Cocker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday, and we won’t be able to resolve this until Sunday at our time, which is Monday at their time.
But we're doing everything we can.
Believe me, when the programs changed, we received a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the issue, believing that it was a technical error.
But it turned out to be a state order.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of wrestlings from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to please the fans, but we overreacted.
It's a bad situation."
'Discs of an Uninhabited Island': Tom Daley Feels 'Insignificant' Because of Sexuality
Olympic water-racing champion Tom Daly said he grew up with a sense of insignificance for others because of his sexuality — but that gave him motivation on the road to success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t understand that “not everyone is like me” until I went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4’s “Discs of a Deserted Island” program in host Lauren Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
Kirsti Young, the traditional host of this rather old program, took a few months off due to illness.
In the role of a man who found himself on a deserted island, on Laverne's first program, Daley said that as a child he felt "less" than everyone else, because "society did not accept those who liked both boys and girls".
He said, "I still believe that this feeling that you are not like everything and insignificant was what gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so that he did not disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, he urged countries not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said that he expressed his opinion, because he was lucky to live openly, without persecution, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – an American screenwriter, director and producer of True Lance Blacke, whom he met in 2013 – “it was unexpected for me.”
Daly married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference doesn't matter.
"If you go through this at such a young age" - he got to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer - he said that it was difficult to find a peer who would survive such ups and downs.
In June, they became parents, their son's name was Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said his "perspectives completely" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have told you I needed to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are things in the world that are more important than an Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.”
His son is also named as his father – Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you’re not going to sit in the first row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he wasn’t immortal,” he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that’s what I’d dreamed of all my life – jumping into the water in front of my fans at the Olympics, that’s the best feeling,” he said.
It also influenced the choice of the song – Proud by Heather Small – which found in it a response to the preparations for the Olympics and from which ants are still running.
"Discs of a Deserted Island" can be listened to on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British Summer Time.
Mikelson, who is out of shape, remains on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record by playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he needs to get back in shape so that this event does not become unhappy.
Michelson, who will play in this biennial competition, a record 12th time, team captain Jim Furyck planted on the bench for Saturday's foreball.
Instead of being at the center of the events, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-time cup winner split his days between cheerleading and training, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the peak of his career, he was not the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer is not the perfect choice for the challenging Le Golf National field, where imprecise punches are severely punished.
And if the field itself isn't gloomy enough, Mikkelson will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Malinara in the ninth game on Sunday, who along with Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, lagging by four points at the start of 12 singles matches, start with success, the match of Michelson can be extremely important.
He had confidence in the player, but he couldn't say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, clung to me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
“He’s very confident.
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame and gave a lot of teams last week and this week.
Maybe I didn't want to play two games.
I wanted to do more, but that's how it worked and that's how we thought we'd play.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the number of Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which has never been the same as achievements in individual games.
At Michelson, he won 18, 20 lost and seven halves, although Furik said his presence had benefited the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with humor, likes to joke about people and just a very good person, who is good to have in the team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to bet his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
It gives the team much more than just a game."
European team captain Thomas Byrne knows that the big gap may soon disappear
Thomas Byrne, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant break before the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup, can easily disappear.
The Danish player made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where the European team led by Cevo Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but finished with a minimum advantage of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that at Valderrama we had a big advantage and won, but with difficulty, we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost,” Björn said after watching how the Class of 2018 team won 5-3 and Friday’s 10 li, and yesterday’s Le National, and the peacocks c.
“The story shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not the end.
We have to play tomorrow.
Go out on the field and do it right.
As long as it's not on the table, nothing is done.
We have a goal and this is an attempt to win this trophy, that is what we will focus on.
I keep saying this, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that on the opposite side are the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the way his players played on the heavy golf course, Björn added: “I will never overestimate myself in this.
It's going to be a different game tomorrow.
There will be a game tomorrow, but that's different.
It's great if you're on the field with your partner and everything is going well, but if you play alone, then your true talents of a golfer come true.
Here's what you need to bring to the players that they need to show the best tomorrow.
Now we need to leave the partner, the pits need to go and also show all the best as an individual player."
Unlike Björn, his rival Jim Furrick hopes for a better individual performance from his athletes than the one they demonstrated in the partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these last-day matches, playing in a winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had a "Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every word of that," he said, answering a question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999 tuned his players to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we always want to have a quick start, like you saw in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When the speed increases, the greatest pressure is exerted on those who play matches in the middle.
We made a proper schedule and put the players the way we liked. You know, tomorrow we are trying to get a little bit of magic."
Thomas has been tasked with starting a rematch and playing against Rory McIlroy in the lead game, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will play against top golfers.
“I put my players in that order because I think I’m going to close everything,” Björn said of his selection for individual matches.
The launch of the new German warship has been postponed.
The new frigate of the German Navy was supposed to enter service in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will appear no earlier than next year due to faulty systems and steadily increasing prices, according to local media.
The descent of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new class of frigates Baden-Wuerttemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoting a military representative.
The ship was supposed to go into service in 2014, but the problems that arose after construction hinder this ambitious project.
The four warships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered back in 2007, are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with powerful cannons, various anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some "stealth" technologies, for example, reduced visibility for radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics – longer periods between maintenance – newer frigates may not enter their ports for up to two years.
However, the permanent delays mean that modern warships – which could allow Germany to demonstrate its strength outside the country – will become obsolete until they finally come into service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media wrote about numerous "defects in software and equipment" that make the ship useless in a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class have only 120 sailors – half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship has a very large weight, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of ships of this class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the price of the entire project – including the training of the crew – also becomes a problem.
The price reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – although initially it was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems accumulating with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, said the Navy “has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions.”
He said that the problem is increasing over time, because old ships are written off, and there are no ships to replace.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class was able to join the Navy.
The National Society for the Protection of Monuments listened to the secret life of bats
A new study is being conducted in the Scottish Highlands, aimed at discovering how bats use the landscape in hunting for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of unique flying mammals and help in future conservation actions for these animals.
A study by scientists from the National Society for the Protection of Monuments of Scotland is looking at the small bats and also the brown-eared bats of Dabanton at the Inverry Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in the main locations of the area to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
Employees of the Society and volunteers will conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds of all records determine the frequency of calls of bats, as well as what bats do.
The residence map and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Dewar, an advisor to the National Society for Conservation of Nature, hopes the results will show which areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of creating habitats such as meadows and how to maintain forests for bats and other related animals.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect the place of residence and destroy them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as adhesive tapes for flies and some chemicals for building materials. They are also threatened by house cats.
They're not blind at all.
However, due to their night life, bats' ears are more sensitive than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect bugs and obstacles on the flight path.
The National Society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, home inspections and, sometimes, rescue activities.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish bat reserve in the Trivee estate in Dumfries and Galaway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
David Thompson, the head of the estate, says it's an ideal area for bats.
"Here, in Trier, we just have a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about bats yet, so our work here and in other estates will help us understand more about what they need for a better life."
He emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before carrying out repairs of the property, as it is possible to inadvertently destroy one seat, killing up to 400 female and young bats, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
The bats are protected and are prohibited from killing, intimidating, disturbing or destroying their seats.
Elizabeth Farrell, an employee of the Bat Conservation Organization in Scotland, urges the public to help in this matter.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and about many of the species we don't even know how their populations live."
Ronaldo is accused of rape, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news,” saying people wanted to “advertise themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
The Portuguese forward and Juventus were accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas apparel room in 2009.
He then paid her $375,000 for her silence, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video, the 33-year-old Ronaldo appealed to his 142 million subscribers hours after the allegations were made public, calling the message “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s posts are fake news,” said the five-time Golden Ball owner in front of the camera.
"They want to make an advertisement in my name.
That's OK.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of my job.
I am a happy and kind man," he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a case in court against Der Spiegel on charges that they called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in a private case," Reuters reported.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral harm in an amount that corresponds to the severity of the violation of rights, and in recent years this is perhaps the most serious violation of personal rights.”
As if the incident took place in June 2009 in the suite of the Palms Howtel and Casinos in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga seemed to return to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, as it is written in the documents of the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after that, Ronaldo knelt down and said that at "99 percent" he is a "good guy" who suffers from "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that they had sex, but by agreement of the parties.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to an out-of-court settlement, because she was "very afraid of revenge" and she was worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she now wants to retrieve the charges because she feels a moral trauma for the case.
At a time when this event took place, Ronaldo was going to move to Real Madrid with Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian Juventus, closing a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'forever regretted' loss of carmakers
Britain will “forever regret” losing its status as the world’s leading automotive industry after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that he would be “disturbed” by Toyota UK’s statement to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily cut production at a plant in Bernaston, near Derby by half.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border as a result of a no-deal Brexit could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The plant in Bernaston – where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director at Bernaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have raised the question of how cross-border trade will be carried out if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement. Among them are Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that automakers are talking about the risk of no-deal supply chains as a result of Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruptions at the border, leading to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply of parts at the Derby plant, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May’s “Chackers Plan” on future relations with the EU was “exactly designed to avoid these border checks.”
"We need an agreement. We want to get the best deal, which will allow not only the success of today, but also allow us to use this opportunity," he said in the program Today on BBC Radio 4.
“The information we receive not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers suggests that we should be able to continue operating successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long the production will not work, but in the future warned that the added cost will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and lead to a reduction in jobs.
Peter Tsoulauris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the union, said union members are very concerned: “In my experience, if jobs are cut, they will not be renewed.
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise plan for our future relationship with the EU that is trustworthy.”
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for another week” as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, a White House spokesman said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who studies interference in the election by Russia, the ties of Trump aides to Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the Assistant Attorney General or not, and thus jeopardizes Mueller's independence, has been pouring oil into the fire of Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from office with the help of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied this.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid rumours that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the UN headquarters in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he “wouldn’t want” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a skirmish at a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh spoke and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into a statement against Kavanaugh, further slowing down the Senate vote.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday's Fox News Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date has not yet been set, perhaps this week, perhaps next. I believe that, rather, a week later, I take into account all the other things that are in place in the Supreme Court case.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the latest information. "
Some journalists are ready to dispute her claim: Sanders has not held press briefings in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, who hosted the program, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of briefings is caused by no disdain for TV reporters who “work for the public,” although she added, “I agree with the fact that they work for the public.”
Then she said that Trump's direct contact with the press would increase.
"The president holds more meetings with answers to press questions than any president who was before him," she said, adding without specific facts: "We have studied these figures."
Briefings happen, Sanders said, but “if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s much better than doing it through me.
We try to do this often, you have seen how we have done it in the last few weeks. Such meetings, at which you can ask a question directly to the president, replace briefings.”
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or attends meetings on the street, or at press conferences with high-profile foreign guests.
The president's own press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, when he appeared freely and sometimes extravagantly in front of reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote to workers from EU countries in the health system of Scotland before Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU workers working in Scotland's health care system to express gratitude on behalf of the country and wish that they remain after Brexit.
Jen Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government is ready to cover the cost of residence applications from EU citizens working in the country's public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal of our country continued in the summer. They lead to the expected decisions this autumn.
But the British government also hastened preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very busy time for all of you.
I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the performance of the health care service, also benefiting patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us."
Christian Abercrombie underwent surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a Sunday match that his team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reports Mike Organ of Tennessean.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reid told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
“He crossed over to the sideline and suddenly fell,” Reid said.
Coaches and doctors have given Abercombe oxygen even in the field before putting it on the force and transfer it for diagnosis.
A representative of the Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was “no detail about what the injury was” and the Tennessee State are trying to figure out when the player got injured.
Abercombe, a second-year athlete, spends his first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full interceptions, giving only 18 interceptions per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher duty
According to the new plans of the Conservatives, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher duty, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action neutralizes the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in the state duty will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance plans to receive up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Today, Theresa May announced that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher state duty, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters, as well as give affordable housing. It is aimed at people with high incomes.
The increase in the state duty is aimed at individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to the government's housing program for the homeless.
The increase in the current state duty, including higher levels adopted two years ago, on the purchase of second homes and housing for rent, can amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents of the UK, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to buy their first home.
Many rich regions of the country – especially the capital – have become “ghost cities”, because a large number of buyers from abroad most of the time live outside the UK.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson's call to reduce the state duty for young buyers to facilitate the purchase of first homes.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high by seizing land and not using it, and urged Ms May to scrap affordable housing quotas to address the “disgraceful housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a vocal series of housing reforms, including the control of rent and the cessation of "unjustified" eviction.
He also wants to give the local council more powers in the field of housing construction.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my job as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – life for each new generation should be made better.
This is the result of an improvement in our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is unfair that non-residents in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as UK workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is becoming increasingly unattainable, and the problem of the homeless remains very real.”
Jack Ross: “My main ambition is to lead the Scottish national team”
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said that his main ambition is to become a coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is tasked with restoring the club from the northeast, which is now in third place in the Premier League, three points from the first.
He moved to this job in the summer, after returning to St. Mirren in the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But it didn't work," Ross said in a BBC Scotland's Sportsound broadcast.
“I grew up often sick for Scotland at Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
I’ll be there if I’m a good coach.”
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Guus Poye and Paul di Caña.
The former coach of "Aloa Athletic" says that he was not afraid of such famous names in such a large club, previously rejecting offers from "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"Now the success for me will be the answer to the question "Can I return this club to the Premier League?"
According to the structure and material base of the club, its place is probably in the Premier League," he said.
"Not only to bring him back there, but I will consider my work a success only if I can get the club back there."
Ros only worked as a coach for three years, before that he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and worked for 15 months in the coaching staff of Harts.
He then helped Aloa return from the third league and turned Saint-Miren from a loser who almost made it to the Championship to the next season's winner.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, Saint-Miren and Hamilton Academic.
Recalling the work at Aloa, he said that "It was a really important choice."
"I really believed that coaching work is what I need, even more than a game.
Sounds amazing, because I've worked well, earned well and reached certain heights.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still going through it when it comes to stress and pressure, but coaching is what you need.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, and for me it's the best time of my adult life."
The full interview can be listened to on Sportsound on Saturday, 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 British Summer Time.
According to the study, the ideal time to drink a pint of beer – 17:30 on Saturday
The hot summer has boosted the profits of British pubs struggling to survive, but has brought pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the statistics of the group of pubs and bars, sales grew by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants, sales decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the consultancy business group CGA, which collected more of these statistics, said: "Prolonged sunny weather and longer than expected, the participation of the English national team in the final of the World Cup, means that in July, the sale of the 8th, in June, the 2nd, when
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars, which mainly sell drinks, have so far shown the best result in contrast to restaurants.
Pubs that sell more food are also burned in the sun, although not as strongly as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent, and food sales decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s recreation and accommodation analyst, said: “These results are the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the catering market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to struggle, as sales fell by 4.8 percent per year, and it is very unpleasant when prices are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer has come at the worst time for food-focused operators, and time will tell whether or not lower temperatures in August will bring such anticipated relief.”
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the recently opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployment.

One in five children has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents.
The study found that one in five children – some only 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
Study of 20,000 high school students showed the growth of “fake Insta” pages
It's a sign of fear that there will be sexual harassment.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "basic" account that they show their parents
One in five children – some only 11 years old – creates accounts on social networks, which keeps a secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake Insta” accounts – which seem to lead to an Instagram photo-sharing site.
It's a sign of fear that there will be sexual harassment.
Twenty percent of students said they have "clean" "core" accounts to show their parents, and also have private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found out that she had called on others to “rape me”.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Directors' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of teens aged 11 to 18 had two profiles each, and half of them admitted they had secret accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s very worrying that so many teenagers want to create places online where neither parents nor teachers can find them.”
Aileen Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” in the Scottish Athletics Council
Aileen Doyle was elected to the Scottish Board of Athletics as an observer member of the board at its annual general meeting.
Doyle, Scotland’s most-titled athlete and chairman of Ian Beatty, described the event as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from its experience at a variety of levels, including international over the past decade.
“Aylid enjoys great respect in Scotland, the UK and the world sports community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will get a lot of benefit from her work in the world,” Beatty said.
Doyle said, “I want to act as the voice of the athletes and hopefully help manage the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won gold in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two gold medals at other Olympics, and who now works as an expert for the BBC, cannot walk after surviving a micro-stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was hard work, but I've fully recovered, I've learned to walk again and now I'm doing an obstetric exercise!
“Thank you for your support!”
Advertising of a milk pump, where mothers are compared to cows, shared opinions on the Internet
The dairy pump company shared the view by releasing an advertisement comparing lactating women to the cows they milk.
To commemorate the launch of what’s called the world’s first pumped milk pump, consumer company Elvie released an ironic video-based music ad to showcase the freedom this device gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a coven with cows to a song, where there are such words: “Yes, I give myself, but I have no tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, it’s not udder, it’s my breasts.”
And he sang, “Dai, dai, I feed the children, dai, dai, I give my women.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused a heated debate on the Internet.
77 000 views and hundreds of comments. The reaction to the video was ambiguous, many said that this is the horror of dairy production.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their children are taken away in a few days," wrote one viewer.
Elvie's milk pump inconspicuously hides in the breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “Clearly traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a milk pump for a mother who does not take away her children?"
Someone added: “Such an unthinkable advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman wrote that she considers the song "fun".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I had a breast.
The fact that I'm pregnant makes me feel sick.
It's a bit crazy, but I liked it.
It's a brilliant product," she wrote.
Another comment: "Very entertaining advertising, aimed at mothers who suck milk pump (often at work or in the toilet) and hear themselves "cows".
This is not the case, nor is it the case of the witches.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all danced with invisible milk pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women who use milk pumps feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires, no tubes and seamlessly hides in the bra for nursing women, gives women freedom of movement, allows you to hold children and even leave the house while working the device.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a clear and provocative launch.
Drawing a parallel between lactating women and dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to the suction of milk and its difficulties, while demonstrating in a fun and gentle way how the new milk pump will bring extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time that Elvis has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium in clothes from Martha Jakubowski, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children are being transported to a tent camp on the Texas border.
Although the number of border crossings per month has barely changed, the number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, partly due to the harsh rhetoric and policies pursued by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are immigrant illegals who are afraid to endanger their own stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased significantly in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would need to submit fingerprints and the data would be handed over to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, addressed Congress with a report on the arrests by the agency of dozens of people who had asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later reported that 70% of those arrested had no prior convictions.
“About 80 percent of persons who are sponsors or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a significant part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
So we continue to pursue such people,” said Mr. Albans.
For faster treatment of children, officials introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, and, according to shelter workers, the previous standard period was 60 days.
A large number of people to apply for their own legal status, an immigration judge will have to use video instead of attending the court in person.
Those deemed to have no basis for providing assistance will soon be deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from sources in the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the higher the likelihood of depression or increased anxiety, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escapes.
Lawyers say that in larger institutions such as Tornilla, these problems are much more pronounced, as signs that the child is in distress are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to a tent town without giving time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends can worsen the trauma that many have already faced.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of the "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home despite the country's eighth year of war.
Muallem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, on the basis of the fight against terrorism, and "they will be considered accordingly".
"They should leave immediately and without any conditions," he said at a meeting of the Assembly.
Muallem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions forced to flee their homes since 2011, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said that Damascus intends to continue “to wage this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
About 2,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Syria, mostly serving as instructors and advisers to Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France's ground contingent in this war-torn country is more than 1,000 troops.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said that the conditions for return are favorable and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that hold refugees abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their return,” he says.
"They are politicizing an exclusively humanitarian question."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be helped in its reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major backdrop of Idlib rebels has created an opportunity for continued political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces against a province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had "exact deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants from the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene in the near future the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem expressed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the commission should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why Trump is going for a second term.
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election, when, as many liberal viewers hope, the impeachment and scandal do not end his presidency ahead of time.
And this, without a doubt, will be the most dramatic finale of the presidency in all history!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News an average of 2,4 million viewers in prime time, compared with 1,7 million four years ago, and the broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" channel MSNBC gathered on the screen 3,5 million viewers and surpassed the ratings of the cable.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because we don’t understand it,” says Neil Baer, director of the ABC drama “The Successor,” about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nellie Scowell, a mastermind comedy writer and author of the book “A Pair of Funny Details and a Few Hard Truths About Infiltrating the Hollywood Boys Club,” there’s another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
He told her that he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
- What? - What? - What?
He replied, “Because he’s making me happy,” Miss Scowell told me.
Chaos is also something that can be fun.
Of course, unlike all the rest of the television, the storylines that come out of Washington, can be as decisive future, as the case of "Rov vs. Wade", depends on it, whether the immigrant families will be able to unite and health
It’s a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, if you watch the sixth hour of the city's ram for a group of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward's "not for print" in the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $ 15,000 jacket with oyster skin (clothing dressed with pride), Trump's ram for being, ram for being, and ram for being, as written in "The Washington Post"
I'm never going to look at Super Mario the same way I did before.
“Part of what he does is making you feel like you’re watching the reality show he’s showing every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Stars show, Trump’s Pawnee Show.
You can't afford to miss even one episode, otherwise you'll be left out of the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, behind the windows of his house on the north bank of Kauai stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees of heat, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while CNN recorded.
It couldn't have happened, not when Brett Cavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee, discussing the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we were making these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Foreign cash flows pour into the tough pre-election race of the midterm elections in the House of Representatives
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th constituency has been covered by a cash gulf due to a change in the boundaries of the constituencies introduced by Congress, which is why two candidates participate in the elections for one seat.
The recently repainted suburban area of Pittsburgh is surrounded by a Democrat, member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the election last spring.
Lambu opposes another incumbent MP, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the votes of the old districts were unconstitutionally counted in favor of Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district has caused a decline in the company's funding by the main parties' financial groups, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (CDC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in a widely enlightened election in Pennsylvania's 18th District in March.
This seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county with a 20-point margin.
Political experts say there is a slight preference for Democrats.
The United States assessed the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already supported Beijing's position, despite little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump leadership team.
Representatives of the State Department decided to recall the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with the "recent decisions on non-recognition of Taiwan", said the State Department spokeswoman Heather Nav
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would be painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the internal meetings ended, representatives of North and Central America postponed the holding of a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which would be a continuation of a similar meeting last year, which was seen by the two leaders as a step in their efforts to promote peace and prosperity.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear they wanted the conference to take place and actually stopped considering the question of El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pension will now speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration is in favor of holding the event.
And three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman, Mr Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debates, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by other analysts close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
Let's learn history
The next step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, examples of which currently have very strong evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller drew attention in the investigation to the possibility of a conspiracy of the Trump campaign and Russia in the attack on the elections.
If Congress changes host, Mr. Trump will face accountability to that body, just as he is preparing to speak again to voters, and possibly ultimately to a jury of his colleagues.
There are a lot of “ifs,” and I don’t mean to say that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, just like the likes of him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make a choice that determines how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
The story revolves around such turning points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or postponed.
Right now, the Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What happens if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president's words and pondered his impropriety.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' story is inaccurate.
“How are we going to react if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into the Bret Cavanaugh case is not comprehensive or fair, or if it is approved by the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault allegations and dishonest testimony?
And, first of all, are we going to vote for a Congressional election that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, a long winter for democracy will come.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on this table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorans of the Rangers are optimistic on the eve of the match with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to confidently withdraw from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from playing for the first time in a 2–2 draw with Villarreal, however, he believes the Rangers will be able to take advantage of this result as a springboard.
“It was an important match for us, because Villarreal is a strong opponent,” the 31-year-old footballer thinks.
“We started the game thinking that we could get something, and earned a point.
Maybe we could have scored the ball in the end, but in general, the draw was also a good result.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second we got ourselves in hand and we had the best half of the field.
On Thursday, there will be another big night for European football.
"I hope we can score three points, but it's going to be a difficult game as they scored a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of fans in the stands, I'm sure we will be able to overcome them and show a good game.
"Last year was definitely tough, both because of my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now we have a factor of confidence.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy the game; the workouts are productive.
I hope that we will be able to move forward, surpass the result of last season and achieve success."
Women are losing their sleep because of fear of death.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted for themselves, few of them talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study reported talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking steps to discuss it,” says Holly Snyder, Nationwide’s vice president of life insurance.
Here's where to start.
Discuss this with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you do not voice your wishes in advance.
Work with a counselor and family and discuss where and how to get medical care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Get involved in the discussion of a financial consultant. it can also help to find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these costs, or you can insure your life yourself – provided you have the money.
Resolve cases with legal documents: anticipate legal battles.
Get a health care credential to appoint a trustee to supervise your health care and ensure the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you can't speak.
Also, consider the possibility of issuing a trust in the management of finances.
Assign a trustee to make financial decisions and ensure payment of your bills if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs immediate medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about drugs and the presence of allergies?
Write down these details in writing so that you're ready.
“Not only financial issues play a role, but also the professionalism of doctors,” adds Martin.
“Which kind of leaks?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
We need to plan everything.”

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disconnection, humanitarian aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongal Regency, a district north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people as of 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that stretches along more than 180 miles (300 km) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency is an administrative unit with a status lower than the province, in 2017 it numbered 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the backbone of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disaster Mitigation, Palu and Dongal have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by the tsunami in Dongal, hundreds of homes were destroyed.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic-active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly rocked by earthquakes.
The following is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the entire Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in the Aegean.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: In the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, there was an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mint islands outside Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pidgi Jaya regency in Aceh province, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not come, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Indonesia Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which contradicted reports of domestic violence and resistance to arrest published on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took the phone from her.
According to the channel «KTUU», Palin is in the investigative isolation Matanusko-Susitno under a pledge of $ 500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "exactly innocent" when asked if he would plead guilty, the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, for which he faces imprisonment for up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable by imprisonment for a day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Pauline has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to tell them about the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he had slapped her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic syndrome caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: hundreds killed

The federal prosecutor's office demands a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, in October allegedly used a rented truck company "Home Depot" to drive on a bicycle path along the West Side Chassis in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the death sentence, according to the notice of intent to achieve the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" shot down eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court documents, for both offences, the death penalty is possible.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal investigating jury stunned Saipov by filing a 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of murder in support of the racketeering; this point is usually used by federal prosecutors and prosecutors in cases of organized crime.
According to prosecutors, the attack required “careful and deliberate planning”, and describing the crimes committed by Saipov, used such phrases as “detestable, cruel and corrupt”.
"Saifula Khabibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, caused damage and caused losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ana-Lora Decadt, Daren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferruccio, Hernán Diego Menno"
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last criminal case involving the death penalty was launched in the Southern District of New York.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug vendors, but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death penalty was applied in New York City was in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after they had been convicted two years earlier of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an expatriate from Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated the absence of rebukes of conscience in the days and months after the attack.
According to police, he said that he was pleased with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that the attack was inspired by watching a video of the Islamic State on the phone.
He also asked for permission to display the Islamic State flag in a hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the indictment, which consists of 22 counts.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "unconditionally disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the pain of these events for all participants,” Patan said.
In the past, Mr. Sasuke's defense team had asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Torah MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit talks.
Today, during a protest at a Torah party conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the People's Army".
Former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel uncomfortable” from Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s MPs proposed his candidacy for EU talks.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would have already “come out” if Mr Farage held the post of Brexit secretary.
But the problem faced by Ms May while trying to reconcile her divided supporters was exacerbated when the Tories, who advocate for EU membership, staged a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the compromise Chequers Agreement under constant pressure from supporters and opponents of the exit, as well as the EU itself.
Allies insist on continuing to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and "disorder".
Mr. Bone said at a rally in Salihal "Leave Means Leave" that he wanted to "throw the Checker off the board".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made equal and that he should be held accountable for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have already left,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I’m for Brexit, but we need to step away from the Checker Plan.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We have not led world wars to be dependent.
We want to keep our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion changed after the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.”
Andrea Jenkins, a supporter of Brexit and a member of the Torah, was also on the march, and in an interview with reporters said: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Checker plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and activists who actually go out on the streets and elect us.
“Please leave the plan and start listening.”
In a sharp appeal to Ms. May, she added, “Prime Ministers remain in office when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said politicians need to be made “discomfortable” if they are going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us, the people and the politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say to them, ‘This won’t get away with it.’”
In his address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make those of our politicians who are ready to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved the banners of Tories Against Brexit (Tories vs. Brexit) after the group launched this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives about the security issues they faced because of the party program at the opening of the conference.
“These are people telling us that they can have a ready-to-use IT system and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the process of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will “pay close attention to the process of running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat on Saturday spoke about her future during a general meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is about to be re-elected, opposed by Republican Party member Jeff Diehl, who was Trump's campaign co-chair in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been at the center of discussions as a possible rival to Trump in 2020.
Since Trump took office, it was the 36th meeting with voters in the format of the general meeting, which took place on Saturday in Halioka.
One of the participants asked if she plans to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix a broken government, and for that, a woman should be at the head."
The arrest took place after the death of basketball player Sims from the University of Louisiana.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder of basketball player Wade Sims had been arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dean Simpson during a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying the person who appeared on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
“Wade Sims received a gunshot wound to the head as a result of which he died,” – said on Saturday to journalists channel “247sports” police chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wade stood up for a friend and was shot dead by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A 6-foot, 6-inch (201 cm) junior athlete grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims last season played in 32 games, of which 10 were on the pitch from the start, averaged 17.4 minutes on the pitch, scored 5.9 points, landed 2.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is close to the title of the world champion after an intra-team agreement won over Sebastian Vettel
Since Waltery Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton's qualifying race on Saturday, it has become clear that the regulations within the Mercedes team will play a significant role in the race.
Bothas pulled out a good seat on the foal and almost left Hamilton at the mercy of fate until he defended his seat on the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
The chair first went to the pit stop and left Hamilton hanging out at the end of the overall mass of riders, it was this maneuver that should have been decisive.
The driver of the "Mercedes" went on a pit stop for a lap later and came out from behind Vettel, but Hamilton came forward after several maneuvers round-the-clock, which forced the driver of the "Ferrari" to leave the inner space of the car free, at the risk of staying behind
Max Verstappen on his 21st birthday started from the back row of the grid and by the end of the first round was in seventh place.
He then led most of the race while the tyres were held, as he wanted to finish quickly, overtake Kimi Rykanen and take fourth place.
As a result, he went for a pit stop on the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed on the other eight rounds, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
"It's been a tough day because Walters has performed fantastically all weekend and has been a true gentleman, if I'm allowed to say so.
"The team did an outstanding job to take first and second place," Hamilton commented.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted it wasn't the source of a leaked letter from Christina Blasey Ford in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brad Cavanaugh of sexual violence.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people could be “spicy, disgusting, and untrue.”
“The only thing that can happen, and that’s the beautiful thing that’s been going on in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see angry, ugly and lying people,” he said.
“When you read about press releases and leaks, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do this.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, is this your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document – “oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, no, no.
Nothing happened to me.”
Wait a minute.
“We are not going to let them go,” he said, adding that he was not going to let them go.
Feinstein sent a letter in July detailing the accusations put forward by Ford against Cavanaugh, and he fled in early September – but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked that the story remain confidential and I satisfied her request."
But her refusal, probably, did not please the president, who so commented on it during the Saturday rally: "Here's what I'll tell you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing the defense of a Supreme Court candidate accused of sexually harassing three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They’re going to have to go back to whatever they’re doing.
You see the meanness, the abomination, and they do not care who they hurt, through whom they will have to step in order to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars – Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a match against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars were beaten Friday by the Belfast Giants as part of the Elite League, winning a 5-3 draw in a home game on Saturday.
Thanks to the blows of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bavilier, the Giants led by two goals in the beginning.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney equalized the number before Dwyer resumed the leadership of the Giants.
François Bouchard of Dundee tied the number, after which Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the team's victory with two goals.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in a season for team Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time in a season; the previous three games were won by the Giants.
The first goal in the fourth minute of the match (03:35) scored Dwyer with the submission of Kendall McFaul, and four minutes later, Bavilier doubled the number after the submission of David Rutherford.
In the busy first period (13:10) Sullivan opened the number from the hosts of the field, and then Coon equalized the number after Matt Marquardt's handover (15:16).
Dwyer secured the lead for the Giants on their first break, scoring their second goal for the match at the end of the first period.
Taking the side was regrouped, and Bouchard again equalized the score, scoring the puck at the numerical superiority of the team (27:37).
Coon and Charles Carcoran helped Nielsen take Dundee in the lead for the first time for the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the victory along with the team's fifth number in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, will play their last home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies, saving hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has died heroically, ensuring the successful takeoff of the aircraft with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared after a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which caused a tsunami.
Strong underground thrusts are still ongoing, and many people are buried under the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were fleeing, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower that was wildly swinging at Palu Mutiara Airport Sis Al Jufri.
It remained in place until the aircraft 6321 of the company «Batik Air», which was at that time on the runway, did not break off from the ground.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided that it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
As reported by the Australian program «ABC News», according to the representative of «Air Navigation Indonesia» Johanes Sirajta, the manager's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning, before the helicopter flew to Palo.
“Our hearts are broken,” he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand, and the disaster risk reduction agency says access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Bouton is restricted.
The representative of the agency Sutop Purva Nugroha said: "Perhaps the number of victims will still increase, as many bodies have not yet been able to dig out from under the rubble."
The waves, reaching up to six meters, devastated Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes are providing humanitarian aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a car ‘quickly’ brings bodies.
There's no clean water.
They’re going to make shops.”
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what awaits them here.
It's a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Jock Widoda arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” asked CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered from the Lombok earthquake, which killed more than 550 people.
Air accident in Micronesia: according to "Air Niugini" one person was missing after the crash of the plane in the lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight that made an emergency landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane, and now reports a missing passenger.
The company "Air Niugini" said in a press release that as of Saturday, it could not provide a report on the location of a single male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately disclose the passenger's details; for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane landed on the water while attempting to land at the airport of Chuvk Island.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been admitted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unclear.
According to both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
According to some witnesses, the plane leaped through the landing strip.
According to the American passenger Bill Janes, the plane flew very low.
"It's very successful," said Janes.
According to him, he and others were able to get through the belt in the water to the emergency exits of the plane, which was already sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and began to scream, and that he also received a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who repaired the nearby dock also helped with the rescue, using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in the crash of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea over the past twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
Analyst resumes the course of events on the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the indictment concluded the presentation of evidence in the case of a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Roulet testified for hours as an engaged expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quintan Thales and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
According to Roulet, he received location information from several cell phones that showed Thales was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his past statements.
When the information that his cell phone was near Chambers's phone at the time when, according to his allegations, he was with his friend Michael Sanford was confirmed, the police were about to ask Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When the indictment asked if Thales was telling the truth about Sanford being in the van that night, he said he was "lying since my van was in Nashville".
Another controversy was Thales' claim that he was familiar with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had known each other for a week.
According to Rowlet, some time after Chambers' death, Thales deleted her messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
“He’s out of his life,” Haley said.
The disputes between the two sides will begin on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be referred to the jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio intends to challenge the negative view of this genre, filling their music with positive settings.
The High Breed, a band from Bristol, says hip-hop has moved away from its origins: political statements and passionate issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Akala and Lowkey have regained the popularity of bands such as The Fugees and Common in the UK.
There's another black one?!
Nanny from New York sues a married couple for "racist" message after dismissal
A babysitter from New York sues a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an accidentally sent message from her mother complaining that she is "another black woman".
The couple denies that they are racists, equating the lawsuit to "extortion".
In 2016, Lynsey Plaska-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first working day.
“Not hers, she is one black-skinned,” wrote Mrs. Plaska-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent a message to Miss Morris twice.
As reported by the New York Post, realizing the mistake, Plaska-Flaxman "feel the embarrassment" dismissed Miss Morris, arguing that the former nanny, who was also an African American, was not doing well at work, and that she was waiting instead for her Filipina.
Mrs. Morris paid for the day's work and was sent home on Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple and wants compensation for her dismissal under the terms on which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract: $ 350 a day for six months with accommodation.
“I want to show them that this is not possible,” she told the Post on Friday. “I know that this is discrimination.”
The couple dismissed the allegations of racism, arguing that Maurice's dismissal was a sensible decision, given that they could not trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she shouldn't have said.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” said Joel Plaska, the husband of the Post.
“Would you trust your children to someone you treated rudely, even if by chance?
Your baby?
Is it?”
Plaska equates the lawsuit to “extortion” and reports that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
"And you're going to pursue a man in such a position?
It’s pretty tough,” added the specialist on investment and banking activities.
Although the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the married couple on social media, subjecting them to sharp criticism of their behavior and logic.
Puddington's publishers feared that readers would not be overwhelmed by the talking bear, the new letter says.
Bond’s daughter Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It's so interesting to read this, already knowing about the huge success of Paddington."
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before daring to write a children's book about a little toy bear, was optimistic despite his work not being accepted and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was a "bitter-sweet year" after his death.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success, speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family".
"He was a very quiet man, and not at all boastful," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost a parent's honor for a child who achieved something: you are proud of them, although it's not really your merit.
I think that's the way he saw the success of the game.
Even though it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always paid tribute to Podingtan himself."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
"Over regularly called to tell you that everything is really bad, that she will not stand," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa.
“Then Nad called me to say that she was going to die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, “Tash, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to beat her heart, slowly left her body.
She died some time ago, and that was the end.
I just had to sit there knowing that it was all happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had suffered the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – and they had no idea what she had to go through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I’ve had tears all the time and tears in my face.
It's hard to explain, but it was in the air that I felt the sympathy of Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women who grieve put out cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones, who have committed suicide, do everything so that other people do not take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang out cards with warm words and phone numbers that people can use to get help on a bridge in Wales.
Ms. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the way I do,” she said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lida, said her son was a talented chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
People said that his smile would illuminate any room."
However, before his death, he quit his job, because he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m constantly worried that this could have unpleasant consequences.”
Mrs. Davis created the cards, “so that people know that there are people in the world that you can contact and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent – you need to talk.”
Ms. Husfreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was sad or that he was depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the feast day, he was very depressed: when the children opened the gifts, he did not even look at them."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to live with it: "There was a huge hole in the family.
It's just killing us.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brad Cavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI opens an investigation
“I thought we could have what he wanted – a time-limited and covered investigation – we could get a little bit of reunification,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was “collapsing” because it actually got into a traffic jam.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their unwillingness is sometimes explained.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6 – when Republicans are expected to suffer defeat, then they will be weakened in their attempts to elect the candidate they need to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senator to gain the support of Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush's presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh will get at least 50 votes during the Senate vote, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the issue of equal votes and approve him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors has declined under Kim's leadership.
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Park Bo Song, citing South Korea's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year and 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main reasons were the increased border controls between North Korea and China and the higher prices set by smugglers for the smuggling.
Pyongyang hasn't commented on this.
Most of the refugees are from the north and are now eligible for South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, with which North Korea has the longest border. It is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very heavily guarded.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when they agreed on a common deadline to work with the aim of fully freeing the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yang Ho, accused the U.S. of failing to make progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions we are not going to disarm first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavanaugh “hysterical”, she says he should not work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate to the Supreme Court Bret Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said that at his own pace he is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune edition festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman behaved like that, she would be called hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Cavanaugh's speech before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment against Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even shouting and unable to speak when his family and senior classes were discussed.
He also explicitly accused Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him “a grotesque and organized murder of a person” organized by liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's speech showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he clearly showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the manner in which he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was elected and if the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this – if he is not telling the truth in Congress or in the FBI, then he should not only not work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
At the moment, Kavanaugh is a judge of the District Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Medicine Act or in the Row v. Wade case, because Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for hysterical, non-objective individuals to work in court and expect us to say ‘how wonderful’,” Pelosi said.
A woman should be able to do that.
It's a justified accusation, months and years of anger just spill over, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years ago.
"I don't think it's that rare."
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who worked as a director somewhere, and who said that when she was angry, she cried, but worked out the technique of behavior. When she was angry and began to cry, she said to the interlocutor: “Maybe you think that I am sad, because I am crying.
But I'm angry."
I just continued the conversation.
I think it was great.”
Tears are allowed in part as a way out of sorrow, because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from my first job, where I once cried out of unspeakable anger, then an elderly woman grabbed my collar – a restrained boss who always scared me a little – and pulled me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you in tears,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think that you are sad and will be glad that they have troubled you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt cheated on a yacht called Monkey Business and stepped out of the presidential race, a very angry Mrs. Schroeder felt that she herself could participate in the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a very well thought out decision," she told me laughingly 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates, and I was completely unneeded.
Someone called this situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the company has been going for quite a long time, it did not have enough funds, so she said that she would not participate in the elections if she did not raise $ 2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turned out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
“Do you think I’m going to go to jail?” she thought.
When she made a statement that she would not participate in the election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions – thanks to the people who supported her, anger at the system that made it so difficult to receive money and aimed at voters, not candidates.
"You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder's reaction to her condition.
“You might have thought that my corporate sponsor is the manufacturer of Kleenex paper napkins.
I once wondered what they would write on my tombstone.
"She was crying?"
Why a trade war between China and the U.S. could be good for Beijing
The first waves of the trade war between China and the United States were deafening, and as the war is far from over, in the longer term, misunderstandings between the two countries could be in Beijing's favor, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, when new tariffs affected goods totaling $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Each time, Beijing responded in this way, recently raising tariffs from five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised the United States a symmetrical response, and the second largest economy is unlikely to lead the eye.
To force Washington to retreat, it is necessary to delve deeper into the demands, but public leaning towards the United States is almost unacceptable for Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing uses the situation correctly, the pressure of the US trade war in the long run can support China by reducing the mutual dependence of the two countries.
“The fact that a swift policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that will start a process of a sharp economic downturn is far more dangerous than observers previously thought,” said Abigail Grace, an assistant investigator at the Center for Security, which specializes in Asia.
Syria “ready” to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by the war for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and safer, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists in order to return to normal life.
We now have all the conditions to return refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and targeted economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to help rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the country will not accept aid in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. is losing for the sixth time in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Byrne scored 14.5 points necessary to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought the most in the tournament, drove his ball into the water by 3 pairs of the 16th hole, giving way to this match by Francesco Malinara.
Italian golfer Malinara played well in all rounds, becoming one of four players to pass this field with a score of 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spees was knocked out with the number 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thornbyrne Olsen from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter of England, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has become the player with the most wins in tournaments with a career number of 25.5 points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to get the cup back.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after the victory of the European team.
He handed over the baton to his countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday in 2&1 singles matches.
“I’m very proud to have won Tiger Woods, the man I’ve followed since I was a kid,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four homes in France and now has a record number of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Amazing statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and lags behind only Jack Nichols on this indicator.
The American team competed against each other with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tney Finn, who played high-end golf throughout the tournament.
American Captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game defending his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they’re fighters.
This morning, we have shown Europe what we can do.
We Wrestled.
Let's take off our hats in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the Golf Association of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We were overrun.”
