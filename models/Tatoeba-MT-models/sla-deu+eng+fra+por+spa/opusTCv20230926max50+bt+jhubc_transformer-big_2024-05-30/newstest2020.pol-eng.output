Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic.
For the Masses of Liberation and Healing which he celebrates, the crowds gather.
He was about ten years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others are experiencing this.
The Holy Masses for Liberation and Healing are celebrated by Fr Witko.
Once the parents of a 7-month-old child came to him, who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
Surprised, the doctors said: “Operation is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm.”
My parents were crying with happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
Spiritual extraordinary actions of the Creator began to experience as a teenager.
In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at the moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost my human qualities and began to take on the appearance of an animal,” he says.
An invisible force lifted him up, he could not get his voice out.
He felt that he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing baptism, I was freed and returned to human form.
He never told anyone about these strange experiences.
There was a vocation in him.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
His sermons were not just about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people who count on getting rid of the disease participate in Masses about healing celebrated by Father Witko.
However, the clergyman emphasizes that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical healing.
First defeat of Kolping FRAC Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw
Today (September 26 this year) the team of Kolping FRAC deservedly submitted to the current champion of Poland Darts Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of LOTTO Superleague Table Tennis.
Jaros<0xC5><0x82>awians in such a personal list, which they presented with Grodziszczyce, have little chance of winning with the League Sovereigns.
It was a good match against Darth Bogoria.
The team still lacks the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the composition of yaroslavl would reach the third consecutive triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han probably has not yet grown up to win with such aces as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Mark Badowski.
The player from Hellady was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Both in the confrontation with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class to itself.
After three matches, Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably beat Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an emotional, five-hundredth fight – Pavel Siruck.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Leia a chance.
You could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not meet Badowski.
There will be no additional testing for seniors.
What's wrong?
According to the announcements of Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it did not gain the approval of the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.
In the explanation, the agency explained that the target group was poorly selected.
“These actions can even result in the detection of individual disease units, which can contribute to aggravating difficulties in accessing NFZ services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false-positive test result.”
The decision of the Ministry does not understand the President of the capital.
“The money is ours, we’ve provided the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because it is about leading to a situation in which prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that it helps when it comes to burdening the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," Trzaskowski said.
“It’s hard for me to imagine that expert specialists say: Let’s not examine ourselves, because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, then I’m not surprised that the health service is in such a state,” the politician added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday at the UN General Assembly that he would break any agreements made with Israel if the country’s future government tries to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement of annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
“If the future government of Israel, which will arise, proceeds with the implementation of this plan, we will invalidate all the agreements signed [with Israel] and withdraw from all the commitments made,” he said.
“We will completely and completely reject the whole plan,” Abbas said.
“It is our duty to defend all of our rights by all possible means – no matter what the consequences – by fully engaging in the implementation of international law and in the fight against terrorism,” the Palestinian Authority president said in a statement.
Netanyahu, Israel’s former prime minister, was re-elected to form a government after the September 17 elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if he wins the election, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to incorporate all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank into Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace treaties sponsored by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold a Palestinian general election at the UN General Assembly.
The last one took place in 2006.
“When I return home, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and anyone who opposes them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” he said.
In his speech, Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the powers of “full members of the UN and all its organs and institutions.”
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to “force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations in full respect.”
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas’s speech, saying the Palestinian leader “would rather focus at the UN on the Palestinian Authority’s efforts against Israel than fight calls for terrorism in the Authority under his leadership.”
Danon, however, did not refer to Netanyahu’s announcement of the annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescuers want defibrillators in critical areas of Przemysl
The history of the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save human lives.
The Provincial Emergency Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l wants such devices to be located in critical points of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Emergency Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Customs Office in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
On August 28, they were on duty at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyka. An officer of the Customs and Tax Service noticed a man lying unconscious in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist has died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Cao Shuxia, the activist’s wife, was called on September 23 by the Communist Party secretary from her home village to inform him that his husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death, he did not disclose.
At Cao's morgue, she saw her husband's body mutilated, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all covered in blood,” she says.
“They wouldn’t let me take my cell phone with them, and there were a lot of policemen around who wouldn’t let me get close to Wang.”
Police were pressing her to sign a statement saying her husband was seriously ill and had died as a result of an “unfortunate accident”.
PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Center for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the 3rd edition of the GameINN program.
Among the almost 30 virtual projects supported by the NCBR were the development of a platform for creating field games based on the AR game engine that creates a map of the real world along with an application that allows the transfer of data by users; a test and training platform for the verification of practical skills at the workplace and professional improvement using VR and AI technology; an innovative game management model with a new process simulator.
The aim of the GameINN sector program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry in the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 was PLN 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and the already reaching PLN 300 million support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral program are an important impetus for the further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev,” reads the statement.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
“Introduced by the government incentives for entrepreneurs focusing on innovation, such as R&D relief, competence improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by the NCBR, drive the innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market,” says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Gowin, quoted in the statement.
The head of the Ministry of Science points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of co-financing projects, but also remains in their pockets – three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.
“The amount of deducted costs related to R&D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which gave more than PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN”, emphasizes the Deputy Prime Minister.
Wojciech Kamieniecki, Ph.D., Director of the NCBR, recalls that 78 innovative projects were awarded in the previous two grant competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.
The huge interest in the third competition and the variety of applications show that the video game industry has the ideas and competencies to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“It is particularly gratifying that, as in previous editions, the selected projects include solutions for not only entertainment, but also related to Industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortiums of entrepreneurs and consortiums of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for the total amount of co-financing of about PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which almost PLN 105 million was awarded to 27 projects.
Detailed information about the results of the III GameINN competition is available on the website ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
The NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to an initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes, among others, companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confesses to stealing Kasper Dolberg watch
The event took place on September 16.
Dolberg, who arrived in Nice from Ajax Amsterdam at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the dressing room.
Not just because it’s worth $70,000.
The angry Dane did not show up for class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
The case was mysterious from the beginning.
Players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club grounds are monitored.
According to the AFP news agency, Diaby-Fadig finally confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and his teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Danish to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young generation footballers in France.
He arrived in Nice at the age of thirteen and made his debut in the first team three years later.
He has played in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but according to the newspaper "L'Equipe" - the club is likely to terminate him with immediate effect.
For the time being, he has initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Check if you are washing your hands properly.
We all know that you need to wash them (for example, after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for washing to sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
And most of us wash them shorter!
It is enough warm water and ordinary soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise against it).
When washing, we rub not only the bottoms and tops of the hands, but also: fingertips (joined or individually) – rub them with circular movements on the inside of the other hand, the spaces between the fingers (intertwine hands, rubbing fingers on each other), thumbs – each thumb we hold with the other hand and in such a hug for a moment turn.
In an emergency situation (when you can not wash your hands), you should wipe your hands with a wet wipe, and then use an antibacterial gel (in pharmacies, from PLN 5).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the door handles or doors with your hands washed (recommendation of the Main Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it with a paper towel.
Iranian President Says He Rejected Offer of Talks with U.S., Donald Trump Denies
Tehran did not engage in talks with the U.S. during the U.N. General Assembly in New York, despite the U.S. offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump said that the Iranian side has asked for the lifting of restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans have proposed to lift all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran’s nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.
Rouhani: Iran will not hold talks under maximum pressure
The Iranian president said he did not agree to take up the talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He said he had met with U.S. diplomats because he had succumbed to pressure from France, Germany and Britain.
However, he stressed that Iran will not engage in talks in an atmosphere of “maximum pressure”.
“And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be,” Rouhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the United States, and he accused the European parties to the nuclear agreement of favoring US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal “are a precondition that does not allow” for the establishment of dialogue.
“If we can lift this precondition, and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,” he said.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, although he did not agree to such a talk last week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"
Donald Trump tweeted that he rejected the Iranian side’s request.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said “no!” tweeted the US president.
Tension with the atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to somehow save the 2015 deal with Iran, of which they were signatories.
In exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran will abandon its nuclear weapons program and place the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, its remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to maintain the agreement in force.
It hasn't worked out yet.
Washington uses maximum pressure tactics against Iran, and sanctions include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has said that if it does not receive a permit to export the raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

A judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of Emilia, who, according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp, participated in the stalking against the judges, was restored on Wednesday for judgement by the NSA.
The reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, so there is no reason to support the decision of the President of the WSA, Wojciech Mazur, to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, opened an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not turned into a case against him so far.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must deal with the decision of the President of the WSA within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge who publicly spoke about his wife’s mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office due to suspicions of participation in a hate group, will return to adjudication and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Schmidt denies his involvement in the hate group.
He claims there is no evidence of this except for the fake screenshots and the words of his wife, whom he is divorcing.
This is exactly what the other judges associated with the “Cast” claim: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it is quite possible that they will bet on their own.
Because the prosecutors did not lift a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, they also remain silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt’s phone, which she stopped in June on another case.
The police did not wave a finger to secure the devices of people who were identified as persecutors in the February report by Judge Waldemar <0xC5><0xBB>urek.
There is no evidence – there is no Shmydt case, there is no Kasta case.
There is also no case of the head of NIK Marian Banasi about renting a house to pimps and hiding income.
The CBA's checking his assets.
And he'll check when he checks.
And the Commission of Parliamentary Ethics will not deal with Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Commission of State Control somehow gathered to make a curious decision on the dismissal of Banasi’s deputies and his appointment as acting lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American novel, I guess, about how a wife comes home and finds her husband with his mistress in bed.
She's so amazed and devastated that she can't say a word.
She stands at the door mute, and at this time the lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
My husband made the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and shouts: What is this?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks: what woman, darling?
Except that in the case of "Kasta" or Banasi there is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Li<0xC4><0x87>vinko in the final of the high jump
Earlier this season, the returning athlete, a bronze medalist from the 2017 World Championships in London, defeated 1.85 and 1.89 in the first attempt and 1.92 in the second.
1.94 she managed to get only in the third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I can fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final I will have to jump better technically," Li<0xC4><0x87>vinko admitted before the Eurosport camera.
American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karyna Demidik were the best in the eliminations – 1.94 each.
Both players were the only ones who did not reach any height.
The women’s final is scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7:30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in hospital in serious condition
He was taken to hospital and doctors say his condition is severe.
It should be added that he is conscious and conscious.
“We believe that it will turn out that he will win again.
We all pray that he will recover," an anonymous close person to Kornel Morawiecki told reporters at the Super Express.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister’s father is running for the Senate.
“My closest family and politicians keep me alive,” said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview he gave to journalists at the Super Express two weeks ago.
In January, “Super Express” reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been examined at the Military Hospital in Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
“I had some strange, disturbing symptoms and went to the hospital.
Turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was ahead of me.
When the CT scan was done, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...", the prime minister's father said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.
According to Morawiecki, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, Father Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know a lot of people have prayed for me and thank you very much.
Luckily, I don't have any metastases.
I don’t know if I’m going to undergo chemotherapy.
I put myself in the hands of specialist doctors who are rather good-minded.
For now, after this difficult operation, I need to return to a certain state of usefulness.
I hope that everything will be all right," Kornel Morawiecki said in January in an interview with SE.
“If I had been tested too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have already said goodbye to this scumbag,” he added.
Kraków: 14-year-old girl missing
Officers from the City Police Department in Krakow are looking for 14-year-old Nel Stoklósy.
Anyone with any information about the missing person is asked to contact them.
Missing on September 26, she left her place of residence in the evening and has not returned or made contact with loved ones until now.
She was last seen at Stary Go<0xC5><0x9B>ciniec Street in Krakow.
Nel Stoklosa is 14 years old, 167 cm tall, has blond hair and gray-blue eyes.
The last time she was seen, she was wearing a sweatshirt, grey pants and shoes.
Anyone with any information about the missing person is asked to contact the police at 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of Olav jumps.
The title of reports from amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon on September 15 at the hippodrome on Oleandry Street in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, may be misleading for some.
The road to true power is a long way off, but this is what one of the types of horse competition is called...
The competition for the power of jumps consists in the rider and horse overcoming ever-higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed up to two meters.
It is worth adding that the long-standing and still unbeaten world record, set in 1949 by the Chilean Alberto Larraguibel, on the Huaso horse, is 247 cm.
So high in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local amazones at the level of 135 cm is also not among the worst...
The competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of the JKS "W saddle" were a show part of the "Rainbow Riding Competitions" held there a little earlier, about which we write more extensively in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight amazones joined the competition, practicing riding in the O<0xC5><0x82>awa JKS.
Four of them competed on ponies and four on big horses.
In the first group, the best performer was Nikola <0xC5><0xA0>o<0xC5><0x82>dra, who was riding the crazy “Sprinter”.
This small, but very dynamic dungeon began by overcoming obstacles at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at a station with a top beam 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals was he removed from the competition by the jury.
The second place in pony jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding "Famy", and the third by Lena Boru<0xC5><0x84> on "Harmider".
Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on a small mare "Carmen".
Even greater excitement accompanied the starting amazon and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.
Terrible-looking falls were scored by Paulina Szewczyk, who sat on the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding on the “Lotka”.
Luckily, apart from minor bruises, neither the amazon nor the horses were hurt, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with introducing the young mare "Wineta" to the park had riding Veronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz.
We needed either a trainer’s assistant or another pair of horses, followed by a bit of a crazy “Wineta”.
After passing the obstacle from the park, she also skidded at full speed, so sometimes it became dangerous in the boxes and on the stretcher. "Everything is under control!", calmed Jan Sienkiewicz a little frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.
Since the beginning of the competition of large horses, Marta Masalska was doing great on the parkour, riding beautifully presenting "Whisky".
This dignified mare, coupled with an experienced amazon, after the second approach in the final phase as the first jumped 135 cm and it was the best result of the competition at that time.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk scored the same amount on the “Declaration”, Weronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz on the “Winet” and Anastasia Abramenko on the “Lotka”.
To decorate the flo and collect prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these athletes went together, and at the end, together with the Amazons on ponies, in the beat of Radetzky’s march, they performed an impressive honorary round, ending with these interesting and emotional competitions.
Thanksgiving
The Equestrian Sports Club "W Siodle" would like to thank the sponsors of the jump power competition during the XVI "Rainbow Riding Competition": the Municipal Office in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, the Water Supply and Sewerage Plant in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, the County Town Hall and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko breaks away from KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
KWW Max Kolonko's Patriotic Revolution is the name of the election committee under which Mariusz Max Kolonko's #R Revolution political formation was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Mark Jakubiak or Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko himself did not even manage to collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko announced on Twitter that he has ended his cooperation with KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will be waiting for the above KWW to delete my name from the name.
I kindly ask you not to associate my person with the above-mentioned entity," he added and announced that he would provide more information soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his work, or if this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On the 4th of July, on the American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, staying in the USA, announced the emergence of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We’ve had enough of politicians, we’ve had enough of your stupid games, we’ve had enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the government to take over the nation and rule for the good of the nation,” Kolonko said.
The party’s agenda included, among others, issues related to the judiciary (should be elected in a general election), tax changes (comparison of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military assistance to the countries of the eastern flank of NATO, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on the possession of weapons, limiting the number of MPs or introducing a single election.
A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile information suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions ultimately took place.
UBS: Gold close to equilibrium
“The euro rate will continue in the coming months around the ceiling of PLN 4.35, which will be accompanied by a weak economic situation in global markets,” said Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.
“Expectations of maintaining a solid economic growth rate and a stable monetary policy speak for the stabilization of the zloty at the current ceiling,” the expert said in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are easing policies.
“While the zloty is properly priced – the euro’s quotations should remain close to the PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months – Polish bonds are not very attractive, according to him.
Emerging market bonds offer much better returns than Polish bonds,” said Michael Bolliger, Head of Asset Allocation for Emerging Markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the expert, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the global economy.
“The global slowdown may be further deepening, but there should not be a severe recession, or at the very least a drop in GDP dynamics just below zero,” said Michael Bolliger.
“Investors should underestimate global stocks, which may be hurt by the lack of prospects for a U.S.-China trade conflict resolution and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump’s impeachment and Brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should behave relatively weakly," according to the latest letter to investors by the chief manager of UBS Wealth Management, Mark Haefele.
“Actions from eurozone countries should behave worse than the US because they are more vulnerable in a climate of heightened uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown,” the document says.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of German 10-year-olds even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
In the longer term, however, long-term yields should no longer fall, but only short-term ones, as a result of easing the monetary policy of banks.
The Fed has the biggest margin for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency over the coming years.
The long-term equilibrium for the euro is $1.29, which would mean a 19% strengthening potential for the single currency against the dollar.
We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in a narrowing of differences in monetary policy around the world.
“To maintain the strength of the dollar in the long run may not allow the current account and budget deficits,” said Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr is losing its weapon.
Confidential report of the German Ministry of Defence
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has reported the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 ammunition, according to a confidential report compiled by the German Defense Ministry.
The news was reported by the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the parliamentary office of State Secretary Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of the weapon and 3,474 ammunition have so far been retrieved.
Among the military equipment still missing are six MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.
The situation was expressed by the deputy leader of the Left Party, Martina Renner.
As she told RND reporters, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “worrisome.”
Moreover, as a result of the ongoing investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a “miserable balance sheet”.
She also criticized the fact that the list does not show whether there are weapons that were found during the investigation against Bundeswehr lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state and violating the provisions of the law governing access to weapons.
The officer was accused of plotting attacks on leading German politicians for far-right and racist motives.
His “black list” of targets, which fell into the hands of prosecutors, included then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Greens and Anetta Kahane, a human rights activist and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally acquired four firearms, more than 1,000 ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Crying children on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines has recently implemented a feature designed for people who feel that traveling with a crying baby is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the layout of seats on the plane.
If the connection is traveled by minors up to the age of two, the “child icon” appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place far from the one occupied by the toddler.
The BBC reports that the airlines have already informed about the imperfection of this solution.
The “child icon” will not appear if the ticket has been booked by a third party or if the aircraft has been changed at the last minute.
As you might expect, the idea split internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids. We used to be kids, too.
“We need to learn tolerance, because soon we will need a map of seats for mouth-breathing, drooling or drunks,” G Sundar wrote.
Another internet user noted that he was once bothered by crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also no shortage of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me of the screaming children during the 13-hour journey,” he wrote.
Majorca loses money after Thomas Cook's bankruptcy
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not come to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by travel agency Thomas Cook.
Marc Pons, a spokesman for the Balearic Autonomous Government, said on Friday that among the 25,000 vacationers who will not be able to take a vacation in Majorca in October, there are also those who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly linked to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers who had to give up their holidays in Mallorca next month due to the bankruptcy of the British company are citizens of Germany and Scandinavia.
However, according to Pons, because Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island during November-April, the losses for the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the Balearic Islands government has already begun negotiations with international operators to “enter the market of Mallorca” after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The newspaper Diario de Mallorca estimates that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorca.
Approximately 800 are employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palm.
Others will lose their jobs mainly in the hospitality sector.
On Monday, with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook in many Majorca hotels, property owners demanded that guests pay an extra fee for the night.
This situation was experienced, among others, by dozens of tourists from Poland.
The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had shut down at least until the end of October due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its associates.
Friday’s Diario de Ibiza reported that most of the hotels in Ibiza that have worked with the Thomas Cook group have no intention of closing in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds that on this Balearic island the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic Islands authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish government for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million in support of the region to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most affected tourists on this archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Mallorca.
According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is indebted to local travel companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019, about 5 million euros.
FIFA Women's Rankings.
Poland still in 29th place, the United States in the lead
The women’s national team of Poland ranks 29th in the ranking of the International Football Federation (FIFA) published on Friday.
At the same position, the team of coach Mi<0xC5><0x82>osz St<0xC4><0x99>pi<0xC5><0x84>ski was classified in the previous July standings.
Weak team matches.
How will it be in October?
The leaders remained American women, who recently defended the title of world champions.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, and the third remained Dutch women.
The Poles are preparing for the qualifications.
They were supposed to start the away match against the Czechs on September 3.
The day before the meeting, due to food poisoning of the opponents, it was postponed by a year.
In this situation, the Poles will inaugurate the qualifications with a meeting with the Spaniards on November 12 in Lublin.
Previously, “White-Red” will play two friendly matches – on October 3 away from Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group rivals Poles are the national teams of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The winners of the groups and the three best teams from the second places advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the bargains for the last three passes to the European Championships.
The rate of 16 participants will be supplemented by the host – England.
Poland’s men’s national team in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog crushed the government
“The effects of the Clean Air program are shallow, and coal stoves will smoke this winter as if nothing ever happened,” reads the front page of today’s Rzeczpospolita.
“So far, the Clean Air programme has submitted 82 thousand applications for co-financing with a total value of PLN 2 billion, of which 48 thousand decisions were positive.
The accepted applications amount to a total of more than PLN 915 million," Rz reports, citing data from a spokesman for the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper notes, only a part of the costs incurred is refunded from the program.
The results of the loudly announced program are assessed by the journal as "modest".
Local government officials, quoted by Rz, see the failure of Clean Air, among others, in too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic submission, sending invoices by post, possible random control of implementation.
This would make things better,” says Jacek Wi<0xC5><0x9B>niowski, the mayor of Lidzbark Warmi<0xC5><0x84>ski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year of operation less than 1% of the set goal of replacing 3 million smog boilers was achieved.
As noted by “Rz”, although the budget of the program is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, that is, PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
“The budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year is PLN 1.4 billion,” reads the report.
Congress agrees on F-35 for Poland
B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak: Now negotiating prices
The US Congress has approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before signing the contract, but it is not the end of our work,” wrote Mariusz B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak on Twitter.
“We will be negotiating hard to achieve the best possible price,” the Polish minister added.
Polish F-35 deal
The Polish air force will be supplied with 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the U.S. Department of State agreed to sell them to Poland.
The investment will support U.S. national security and foreign policy by improving the security of NATO’s ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is expected to pay $6.5 billion for the fighter jets.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related logistics and program support elements, and personnel training.
Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II, produced by Lockheed Martin, is a fifth-generation single-seat and single-engine multi-role fighter.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out missions of close support, bombardment and typically hunting air combat tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radar.
The F-35 fighter jets were recently purchased by Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16.
Other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also considering buying U.S. warplanes.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The manufacturer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
This is how we fight stereotypes.
Producer Barbie introduced a series of gender-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel introduced gender-neutral dolls.
Toys from the series "Creative World" wear wigs.
Children can decide whether their Barbie should have short or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can turn girls into boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
Gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and a slender waist or, in Ken’s case, wide shoulders.
The company believes that children don’t like it when their dolls have sex norms imposed, and some parents and feminists are convinced that sex-specific toys inhibit girls’ ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” Mattel said.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a bathing suit and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting “unhealthy female stereotypes” such as unnatural body proportions.
The company responded to criticism and has already launched dolls with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: a circle or a club Together can have several deputies
Asked on ZET radio how many candidates of his party can get into the Sejm from the lists of left-wing groups (the SLD KW from which the candidates for the SLD Sejm, Spring and the Left Together, starting with a common logo "Left"), Zandberg replied that it depends on the result of the committee.
“I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people associate hope with the fact that the Left is not only right, but also has strength,” he said.
According to Zandberg, this means that the left can have 60-80 MPs.
“This may mean that the circle or the club Together will have a dozen members.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I will not guess and say how it will happen,” he said.
Asked if the Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are set to be diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by the Poles, because we showed that by differing, we were able to agree on a common program.”
Asked whether SLD leader Vladimir Czarzasty is the biggest beneficiary of the joint start, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are centre-left and left-wing voters.
In turn, noting that the SLD will receive the entire subsidy, he said that "the goal of the political party is to represent its voters."
Zandberg has admitted that he will vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.
In the case of the Senate elections, he said he was thinking.
“The offer is diverse and there are candidates that my heart is closer to, but there are also those that my heart is farther away from,” he said.
“I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in District 44 of the Senate, I would take an election certificate and vote in another district,” he said.
“I would probably not be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (candidate KO - PAP),” he added.
The leader of Polish Citizens Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS compete in this district outside Ujazdowski.
Dakar: The Largest Mosque in West Africa Opened
Tens of thousands of people from across Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, car and foot in the Bopp district, where a new mosque with a capacity for 30,000 worshippers was erected.
The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, a Sufi religion that dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a six-hectare wetland donated by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan Mosque ("Ways to Paradise") comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood, venerated by followers as a saint.
The mosque is surrounded by Carrara marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque in the center can accommodate 15,000 faithful, and the second one can stay on the outer esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, gigantic chandeliers and handmade decorations made by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the building still has no comparison to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can hold 105,000 worshippers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million, was funded by private donations.
In addition to land, the government has funded lighting, sanitation and road works worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.5 million.
Coach Smy<0xC5><0x82>a: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves
The pass of eight league matches without a victory, the players of Korona will try to interrupt in Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of the extraclass Silesia.
“Our problem is not Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play,” emphasized coach Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Smy<0xC5><0x82>a.
The players of Korona last and so far the only victory in the league recorded in the first row, when they defeated 1-0 benyaminka Raków Cz<0xC4><0x99>stochowa.
Later, they scored two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zag<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>bie Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I am optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup match, the players were fighting for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the lawn after the last whistle did not result from the collapse, but it was a fall of anger, because they were so close," Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why it will make the team allergic to playing in the side sectors of the field.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play,” the coach added.
In Friday’s match in Korona, Ognjen Gnjatic, who pauses for excess yellow cards, will certainly not play, and Jakub <0xC5><0xBB>ubrowski and Michael Gardawski will also be missing from the squad.
It is encouraging, on the other hand, to have a few players sign up for the cup match with a desire to play.
“We have a headache, recently it seemed that it would not be there, and now it is,” Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
Defender of the Crown Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the passage of eight league games in a row without a victory, while in the extra-class everyone can win against anyone.
“We are a good team.
We may not show it on the pitch in recent weeks, but there will come a time when we will win and we believe it will be on Friday.”
After nine rounds of the extra class, the Crown with an achievement of five points occupies the 15th position.
Silesia has accumulated 12 more and is placed in second place.
Friday's match in Kielce will start at 20.30.
These trees could disappear from Europe.
“42% of the tree species that make up Europe’s tree beds are endangered,” the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warned in Friday’s “Red Book of European Trees.”
At the top of the list are, among others, chestnuts and jarzbin.
The IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It was compiled by experts who, based on research, concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world), 42% are "highly endangered".
Among the reasons, the Red Book lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As for typical European tree habitats, according to IUCN experts, 58% of species are endangered, and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the exploitation of trees, accelerated urbanization, excessive cutting of trees, and subsequently forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also severely threatened.
“The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual extinction of European plant species and pose a risk of extinction in Europe of important and undervalued varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet,” concludes Luc Bas, who heads the IUCN European office.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> I don’t promise 600+
“Today PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them for freedom a dispensation on credit, which will have to be repaid by future generations,” Grzegorz Schetyna said in an interview with Rzeczpospolita.
In his opinion, “the whole politics of PiS is pic.”
At the same time, the politician promises that “what is given will not be taken away”.
Schetyna assures in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that she has an idea for defeating Law and Justice.
It is about mobilizing the electorate at the polling stations.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this regard than Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski’s party.
“Today, there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than there are supporters of PiS, a party that has betrayed the values proclaimed, such as modesty, humility, transparency,” says Schetyna.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also noted the basic assumptions of the KO electoral program.
“First of all, nothing data will be received, but we need to determine the direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it is about “activating the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work hard – and those who are entrepreneurial”.
Schetyna explains that the KO program included, among others, a project that will give the least earning Poles more by PLN 614 per hand, and more earners - also several hundred each.
The politician also noted that he does not want to race for distribution.
As he said, he will do as much as he can, but he won’t promise 600+.
“I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers bid with the opposition on the distribution, until finally there was a financial collapse of the country,” he stressed.
Schetyna also stated in an interview with Rz that Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.
“Pride walks before the fall.
Kaczynski is a man of state like Banas is a crystal," he added.
The PO leader also said that he had not yet decided whether to apply for the presidency of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Great Dead Condors
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz found six dead condors, reports TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
Great condors were probably poisoned with a means to kill predators such as cougars, foxes or wild dogs.
Animals may have eaten toxic carcasses.
In addition to one young specimen, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
“It’s a big loss for the environment, because the condor has to reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.
So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
“I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health.”
"RZ": They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on granting the head of state a precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda’s law firm – we read in Rzeczpospolita.
As the newspaper explains, it is a golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially called in the interwar period the jewel of the Republic of Poland.
The last time it was used was probably by President Ignacy Mo<0xC5><0x9B>cicki.
"Rz" says that soon such a chain may fall on the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday to work on an amendment to the Orders and Medals Act to restore it.
The newspaper writes that this is also not the first attempt to restore this chain of the head of state.
The Senate proposed the amendment in 1992, but it was lost with one vote.
This time the work is fast.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the case, recognizing that they would consult the President’s Office.
This one came in mid-September.
“I kindly inform that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition,” Presidential Minister Andrzej Dera wrote at the time.
On Wednesday, the Senate Committee continued the case and again devoted little time to the matter.
“The President’s office answered us briefly: it is in favor of bringing it back,” said PiS commission chairman Robert Mam<0xC4><0x85>tow, quoted by Rz.
He submitted a proposal for legislative work, which was supported by the committee.
Police will teach drivers how to drive through a crossroads
The police action will be conducted, among others, at the intersection of al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>skiego with al. Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudskiego.
The uniformed activities are somehow related to the recent complaints of the city authorities against drivers who do not always know how to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27, police officers begin preventive actions in Rzeszów "Crossing Crossings".
It is about eliminating obstacles in traffic: entering a crossroads without the possibility of a descent, non-compliance with light signals or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, but in fact we are making life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobi<0xC5><0x84>ski, the city’s vice president, a few days ago.
His words echoed at the press conference of the town hall, at which the city authorities presented examples of improper movement of cars at intersections, which in effect creates traffic jams.
At the time, the president urged travelers to be wise on the road and, among other things, to move faster on traffic lights or not to write SMS while driving.
The topic was somehow taken over by the Rzeszów policemen, who are starting the “Crossroads” campaign from today.
What's going on? What's going on?
The aim of the measures is to eliminate the phenomenon of restriction of traffic at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing to drive.
This is a common misdemeanor that contributes to increased obstruction of movement and the creation of traffic jams.
It is subject to a penalty of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and improper parking in the area of intersections.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of driving, late departure from signals, slow crossing of intersections and leaving too large distances between vehicles.
At what crossroads will the activities be carried out?
On Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiellonian Street; on Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>ski Street from Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski Street; on Targowa Street from Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski Street; on <0xC5><0x9A>reniawitów Square from D<0xC4><0x85>browski Street or on Hetmanska Street from Warsaw Insurgents Street.
Such actions in the capital of Podkarpacie will be held on the next Fridays of October.
They inspected a company that disposed of waste from “Czajka”
“Officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Wolomy<0xC5><0x84> County Mayor’s Office and the District Construction Supervision Inspection inspected on Friday the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the wastewater treatment plant “Czajka” in Warsaw is disposed of,” said Karol Szyszko, a spokesman for the Wolomy<0xC5><0x84> Mayor’s Office.
Inspectors from the town hall of Wo<0xC5><0x82>omi<0xC5><0x84> conducted an inspection at a plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
Private Trade and Transport Plant “Dar-Trans”, under the agreement with the capital’s sewage treatment plant “Czajka”, performs post-waste management services.
“Inspections of the installation were carried out, and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his activities,” Szyszko said.
He added that the post-audit report will be transmitted, among others, to the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The last inspection in “Dar-Trans” was carried out by the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw between December 29, 2015 and February 11, 2016.
It was then determined that the company did not carry out sampling, measurements and groundwater testing, and also did not have the results of studies of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the Czajka sewage treatment plant.
After the inspection, Dariusz Sobota was asked to stop violating the terms of the decision.
Private Trade and Transport Plant “DAR-TRANS” Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the “Czajka” treatment plant.
In accordance with the decision to conduct waste disposal on the site of the excavation, in the forests near Zielonka, waste weighing up to 60,000 tons per year is processed.
The Warsaw Municipal Water and Sewerage Company reported last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018, STUOS was decommissioned, which was due to damage to one of the incinerators.
As reported by MPWiK, the monthly cost of their export is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa supported Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“You have undertaken a difficult task, you can count on my full support,” Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa told Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska on Friday.
"Mr. President, these are very important words for me," replied the candidate of the Civic Coalition for the Prime Minister, the leader of the list of KO in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, he is now “only a retired supporter”.
Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska met on Friday with former President Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa in his office at the Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk European Solidarity Centre.
A short conversation behind closed doors was also attended by Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa’s son – Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
“You have undertaken a difficult task,” Lech Walesa said after the meeting.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems before Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, there is great hope that you, as a woman, will cope with these problems, and we all – those who love Poland – will support your actions to the maximum," the former president said, addressing Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
Very important words
Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska thanked him for his support.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and know how important it is,” she said.
“Let’s show that we can do different, wise policies, together, but in accordance with the constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
That’s how you did your revolution, and that’s how we want to change Poland,” Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said.
Fans in retirement
Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa told reporters that he is now "only a retired supporter".
“Of course I’m looking at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, verified, (to this) we will return.
The tripartite division of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are indispensable.
And all this needs to be cleaned up, all this needs to be restored to normal operation, and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, then we have a street criterion," said Lech Walesa.
“That is why it is so important that Poles go to the elections, think about it and make their own decisions.
And that’s the most important thing,” added Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“The last chance to improve the situation as it is in Poland with a card,” the former president replied.
“We need to rebuild the foundation.”
Asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said: “The President said very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all other things.
Since the tripartite power does not exist, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not move forward.
Volleyball European Championship: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-finals.
In the hot terrain in Ljubljana, Polish volleyball players faced Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
There was no lack of controversy and discussion with the judges, with the coach of the Poles Vital Heynen in the lead role.
The White-Reds lost 1:3 and will play for the bronze medal.
The Senate has passed key laws.
The Senate passed, without amendments, a law on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials and on the flights of the most important people in the state.
52 senators voted for the amendment to the law on the estates of the families of state officials, without amendments, 14 voted against it, three abstained.
Thus, the senators decided to reject the 12 amendments submitted during Wednesday’s debate by PO senator S<0xC5><0x82>awomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were supposed to “civilize” the law and limit the scope of information given in the declaration on the property situation of their own children, children of the spouse, children adopted in cases where the children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make a statement.
The law on the disclosure of the property of the families of the most important state officials, the draft of which was created in the office of the Prime Minister, was adopted by the Sejm on September 11.
The regulations assume that, among others, the prime minister, ministers, deputies, MEPs, senators, presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons at the head of other state institutions, will be obliged to include in the statement of property information about the personal property of spouses, children and persons remaining together.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on the flights of the most important people in the country.
It regulates what flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important people in the country.
The law also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Flight Register.
55 senators voted for the bill, 12 voted against it, and four abstained.
According to the law, every presidential flight will be a flight “performed in an official mission.”
The president will be accompanied by family members and other persons invited by the president.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will only be a flight “performed in order to perform tasks directly related to the function performed”.
The law also specifies the list of people who can accompany the most important people in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations, there may be members of the delegation on board the aircraft – invited deputies, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational services; as well as journalists.
In accordance with the law, in case of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will ask for their clarification.
If such doubts are not clarified in due time, the head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the law firm of the Sejm or the Senate about the inability to organize such a flight.

The Poles after the first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training session in Paris on Friday, where they will play for the bronze medal on Saturday.
Vital Heynen's pupils closed the way to winning the title Thursday's defeat with the Slovenes 1:3 in Ljubljana.
There was a lot of noise about their problems with traveling to this duel.
This time they did without such problems – on Friday morning they went together with the Slovenes by charter to Paris, and a few hours later they trained in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to the reports of people present in the class, the coach of the world champions was nervous.
As Heynen’s assistant Micha<0xC5><0x82> Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the exercise of volleyball elements.
“We went to the hall, but for the most part it was time for the team.
The idea was to spend more time together than to train.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild all this as a team," he reported.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally brought to earth.
Without a doubt, we are disappointed.
We always thought we would come back to this game.
We discussed this match with each other in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main reasons for failure, I would point to the ineffectiveness in attack and much worse than usual to deal with situational balls.
The Slovenes were much better than us in this regard," he analyzed.
In his opinion, the “White-Red” did not stand in the way of the stress associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament, supported by a loud and large audience.
He admitted that the champions of the world could sleep a little on the smooth road to the semi-finals.
“Perhaps if we had a defeat in the group stage in a similar way, we would have analyzed this lesson faster and then played differently in the later phase of the tournament.
“It’s just a scam,” he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat of the Poles will be able to turn into aggression in the match for the bronze.
“I hope that we will show our true faces.
There's a lot to fight for.
The last time we won a medal was in 2011," he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two meetings of the group stage they went to Apeldoorn, and for the semi-final they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: Severe punishment, but suspended
The Australian tennis player was given a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine - on a six-month suspension - for reprehensible words, gestures and deeds during recent ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour players are losing patience with Kyrgios, but still giving him a chance to improve.
The summary of the misdeeds of the most rude professional tennis player in recent years looks threatening – 16 weeks of break plus a large fine, but still both penalties are suspended for six months – a probationary period in which a stubborn athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been screwing up for a long time and has earned a kind of tennis world record – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on and next to the court.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rockets during a losing match with Karen Khachanov – all for this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113,000 dollars.
In the US Open 2019 he also did not play long, but he managed to publicly say that the ATP activists were "corrupt", which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they launched a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the aforementioned verdict on the suspension of starts and another fine.
However, words about corruption were forgiven him, after listening to the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
In justification, however, tennis activists said that the investigation showed that Kyrgios’ behavior over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted almost constant violations of the rules, that he insulted tournament-related people and spectators in a vulgar way without interruption, hence the high penalty.
However, ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering the fulfillment of several conditions within the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments, Kyrgios can no longer in any way violate the rules of the code of conduct applicable to professional tennis players, in particular, no more to curse, no more to slander, no more to slander.
He was also recommended to seek “continuous support” from mental coaches during tournaments and also outside the season to consult with people who specialize in solving the problems of athletes not coping with proper behavior.
Nick Kyrgios’ first comment to the verdict was, “Hey everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, as his shoulder injury worsened in the Lavera Cup, so he had to give up his next races in Beijing (September 30 – October 6) and Shanghai (October 6 – 13).
In the ranking of ATP Kyrgios takes the 27th place.
This year, he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than $ 1.3 million, so even after the fines, he will have a lot.
GUS: Life is getting better in Poland
According to the report on household budgets published by the GUS on Friday, as many as 44% of them assessed their financial situation as good or rather good.
A year earlier, the percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 it was 33.5%, and earlier – since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households – it never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their financial situation bad or rather bad last year, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The financial situation of self-employed households is the best.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
On the second pole are the households of pensioners, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also greatly influenced by the number of children.
The worst performers are single parents, of whom 32% declare a good or rather good financial situation.
Among couples with children, the percentage varies (depending on the number of children) between 55 and 60 per cent, and among childless households it is 48.8 per cent.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst material situation was assessed by single parents raising offspring and large families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessment of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, primarily from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of voivodships there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of material conditions of households.
The best estimates are formulated by residents of the Opole Voivodeship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
Next are Lubuskie (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazovian (47.3%) and West Pomeranian (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opolskie, the disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94 percent of the national average, and in Lubuskie, 98 percent.
The highest incomes were in Mazovia (120% of the national average) and Silesian (104%).
On average, Poland’s disposable income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (adjusted for the impact of price changes) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Compared to previous years, the result is quite low.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While income growth slows down, it also slows down spending growth.
Those per person amounted to PLN 1,187 last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
Per capita spending increased by 1.9% in 2017 and by 4.3% in 2016.
Surveys of household budgets suggest that a statistical household now spends 70.1 per cent of its disposable income, compared to more than 80 per cent in 2014 and more than 90 per cent by 2006.

Paulina Smaszcz-Kurzajewska appeared in a closed show of the Italian brand “Patrizia Pepe”.
The event was also attended by Natasza Urbanska, Katarzyna Figura and Beata Chmielowska Olech.
A camera show could not have taken place without a wall on which the stars boasted of their stylizations.
Unfortunately, photojournalists caught Paulina Smaszcz-Kurzajewska’s blatant mistake.
The woman wore a white bra under a black shirt, which shone through her tightly.
U.S.: Three suicides among aircraft carrier crew
Three sailors committed suicide aboard the USS George H. W. Bush last week, the US Navy said.
Over the past two years, a total of five crew members of this ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July this year, and the previous one in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each incident occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush moored off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the involvement of third parties has been excluded.
Deaths are not related to each other.
“We need everyone to be involved in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigmatization or other repercussions associated with seeking help,” the ship’s commander, Captain Sean Bailey, wrote on Facebook.
Nesiolowsky criticizes the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
“Actually, every single one of his opinions was accepted.”
Later, there was criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II failed to eliminate Rydzyk’s harmful activity casts a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media into the best even during the life of the Polish Pope,” he explained.
The former PO politician admitted: “There were murmurs of dissatisfaction, the Pope said something, he once did not accept Rydzyk, but he had power, and for being a politician he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do it, nor did his successor," Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski explained.
“Besides, there was this fatal case of pedophilia and the activities of the Church, or rather the lack of them.
I thought a little ahead, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.
The extent of pedophilia in the Church has been known for quite some time.
The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things,” Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski said in an interview with the journalist.
In the opinion of the former PO politician, the Polish Church is an ally of PiS.
“In the period of Solidarity, the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, the crosses hung everywhere.
Now these crosses are Pisovo, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the Pisovo regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will have to pay a salty price,” Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski argued.
“I hope that Pope Francis will persecute J<0xC4><0x99>draszewski, Rydzyk and several others of his kind,” he concluded.
HRUBIESZ<0xC3><0x93>W: Tomorrow is the 590th anniversary of the county

PZPN spills punishments for riots in stadiums.
Disqualified griffin
The fight in the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk almost ended tragically when the duck fired by fans from Wejherowo by millimeters passed the goalkeeper of the opponent's team, Zlatan Alomerovic.
After the incident, the game was suspended for 20 minutes.
The PZPN committee investigating this case imposed a severe punishment on Gryf, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed into their own stadium in the next match.
They will also not be able to travel in groups for league matches until 31 December.
Burdy at the Widzewa <0xC5><0x81>ód<0xC5><0xBA> stadium also caused fans of Silesia Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Here, however, the PZPN verdict was more lenient, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities in this matter.
Despite this, the services allowed the <0xC5><0x81>ód<0xC5><0xBA> fans sector to be thrown into ducks, the chairs to be set on fire and the host sector to be forced.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-off stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to the matches in this and the next edition of the PP.
The travel ban also covered league matches Ekstraklasa, but there it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to replace the marking on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the amendment of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, writing the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish has begun.
For example, "Lions" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our voivodship, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it is supposed to be easier, more readable and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and traffic safety equipment.
“We should remember that the names of towns in neighboring countries often also have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the changes we have prepared in the law, they will finally appear on the signposts along our roads.
The introduction of the new marking begins from the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway," said Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpacie, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total cost of investment?
200 thousand zlotys.
In the first place, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by November 1, 2019.
What does the implementation of the idea look like?
It will be done without exchanging plates, on the basis of stickers.
They will replace the current name of the city with new ones, written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line – first in Polish, and then in the original, in brackets.
This will be a great facilitation for people who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan with a wind gun.
In a pond in Zameczno in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan having problems with its wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had made an animal a target – a shot from a wind gun was found in his body.
“The information about the early bird was received from the villagers of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Centre in Nowa Sola.
According to the report, the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately clear that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and accurately so as not to harm him and not to expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the veterinarian.
After the first X-ray, it was already known that someone made a shooting shield from it.
There were fragments of shots in his body," says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, managing the rehabilitation center.
Wintering in the centre
“The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the resort, where he will spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen it.
He is not able to fly yet.
Release him now would mean that he would most likely not survive the winter,” adds Walasek.
The staff, after undergoing rehabilitation, intends to release him in the spring to the same pond.
The authorities of the municipality of <0xC5><0xBB>ukowice, after receiving information about the reason for the poor health of the animal, intend to inform the prosecutor's office about the case.
The event took place in Zam<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x88>
Gowin: “We need to stimulate Polish, small trade”
“Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments allowing to stimulate Polish trade,” said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, the leader of the Agreement Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Gowin.
During an interview in “Signals of the Day” on radio Jedynka, Gowin stated that trade is dominated by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish manufacturers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
To note that this problem is very difficult to fight, the deputy prime minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term, but received “counter from the EC”.
“We won before the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and formulates a government, we will come back to this topic,” he said.
At the same time, he noted that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and therefore small trade".
"You will have to think about whether the government, the state, has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May, an EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in deciding that the Polish retail tax was unlawful public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act envisaged the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% of income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% of income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission launched proceedings for infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the construction of the tax could favour smaller stores, which could be considered public aid.
She then stated that the tribute had been enforced in an unlawful manner.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax pending the completion of its analysis by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU court paved the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but did not finish the case.
On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press services of the CJEU told PAP that the case is currently at a written stage, where both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure will start, i.e. the hearing of the parties and a possible hearing.
It takes a good few to several months from the appeal to the announcement of the verdict.
“Such proceedings take an average of a year,” a source at the Luxembourg-based court told PAP.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer several practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important ceremony in the life of an infant and his parents.
It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating together his appearance in the world.
So it’s no wonder that freshly baked mom and dad want their child to look their best on that day.
However, before you make a final decision about your child’s outfit, think about whether it will also be comfortable.
In the stores you can find many suits that do not provide the toddler with proper comfort.
So what should we pay attention to?
The main criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child
Until recently, a few weeks old toddlers were baptized, arranged in white sets and placed in the same barrels or large pillows.
Today, children who come to the sacrament are often older: several months old, one year old, or even older.
It is not difficult to guess that such a great consolation already needs a slightly different outfit for baptism.
Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or in the arms of his parents or godparents.
The best way out will be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton sleeping bags or sets.
Although this element of the wardrobe is considered a casual outfit, it is enough to look for its festive variants, for example, with a rivet or lace.
For a boy, a body with a print of a fly and a shelf will be ideal.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have more fantasy in clothes.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple tulle dress
Many parents of girls long for richly decorated, wavy christening dresses complete with coats, belts and caps.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials for their product, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right outfit, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, applications and cute sets will make your little girl look beautiful and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, among the parents of boys, there was a fashion for suits that are a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, rigid collars or caps often made young elegance loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they have been replaced by comfortable, cotton sets.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, that is, soft, jersey shorts, and a blouse decorated on the front in the pattern of a vest.
These outfits look extremely festive, and at the same time do not hinder the movements of the toddler exploring the world.
Krystyna Paw<0xC5><0x82>owicz published a property statement
Krystyna Paw<0xC5><0x82>owicz has filed a statement at the end of her term.
It turns out that the MP PiS has accumulated 110 thousand PLN of savings.
Pawlowicz has announced her retirement from politics.
At the end of his term, he has 110,000 PLN.
According to the statement made by the MP, she receives a monthly pension of PLN 4.7 thousand.
Paw<0xC5><0x82>owicz owns an apartment worth PLN 570,000 and a little smaller, which he rents, charging PLN 880 per month.
The MP also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment at PLN 150,000.
Earlier, Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski also published a property statement.
Voting on the break in the deliberations during the Conference of the Conservative Party
British lawmakers voted against a three-day hiatus in the House of Commons for the annual Conservative Party program conference, as requested by the government.
There were 289 votes in favour and 306 against.
As a rule, the House of Commons does not meet during party conferences, so that Members do not have to resign from either attending them or from parliamentary sessions.
However, opposition parties have decided that in such a crucial time as the last weeks before the planned exit of the UK from the European Union on October 31, the parliament should not interrupt its deliberations.
289 MPs voted in favour of the government's request for a break, 306 were against.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
The refusal to allow the break could be seen as a political revenge on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the Supreme Court ruled the decision illegal and void) and for not wanting to apologise after the judges’ ruling.
Following this ruling, the House of Commons resumed the session on Wednesday, with the most important event of the day being Johnson’s speech and the heated debate that followed.
Johnson has accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“The time has come to deliver Brexit.
It must be implemented in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with an agreement on the priorities of citizens, on health care, on the cost of living.
“Brexit must be achieved so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to begin in Manchester on Sunday and run until Wednesday, October 2.
The conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the reasons that Johnson gave to explain such a long suspension of parliament was precisely the party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” the foreign media wrote.
The president’s spokesman strongly denied these reports.
“This is simply not true,” B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>ej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, including Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, citing Jewish Insider, say that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York, said that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The President said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who said in February that “Poles sucked anti-Semitism with the milk of mothers”.
Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel, Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an assailant who shouted, “Pole, Pole.”
“The quote is not only inaccurate.
That is simply not true,” B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>ej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Duda “never said that Israel was responsible for the latest anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.”
According to Spychalski, the portal "invented it".
According to JI’s interlocutors, during the meeting there was also a dispute between the survivor of the Holocaust, decorated with the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was supposed to agree with President Duda’s words and say that Jews from Israel “such as Israel Katz” are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to the sources of the portal, Boteach was supposed to interrupt Mosberg’s statement.
Who is Bana<0xC5><0x9B> and what did he do?
The townhouse rented by pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in the property statements of Marian Banas.
We summarize another scandal that shocked the ruling camp.
TVN’s “Superwizjera” journalists revealed that Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B>, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, in recent years did not include in the property statement a 400-meter-high tenement house located in the Kraków Podgórze region.
What’s more, his sub-tenant had to lead a sex business in the aforementioned tenement house (and thus rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself has allegedly been collateral for the repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel pointed to the irregularities in the program "Supervisor".
The journalist revealed that from Banasio the tenement house was rented by people connected with the criminal world to use it as a place of “erotic meetings”.
The clients were supposed to be men using prostitutes.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> responded to the allegations vaguely and vaguely.
Interestingly, the tenement house rented by pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia’s property statements.
The house itself was described in them vaguely, and the income from its rental was to be understated.
“The estate of Marian Banas and his wife can be worth from 6 to 8 million PLN.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...]”, writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia tenement house itself was worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office is currently auditing Marian Banasi’s property statements for the years 2015–2019.
Banas announced that until its completion, he will suspend his activities in NIK. “I will speak to you for free leave,” he assured.
The opposition demands an explanation.
“We do not hear the CBA expand its investigation or expedite the investigation of Marian Banas’s property claims.
Therefore, we are forced to consult the state authorities and submit a notification of the possibility of committing a crime [...]," said Mariusz Witczak, MP of the PO-KO.
“If a normal Pole had so grossly low prices for renting his properties, he would already have 10 checks, tax dominoes and tax proceedings,” he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B> is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
He was appointed to this position on 30 August 2019 for a six-year term.
His candidacy was announced by Law and Justice and accepted by the votes of politicians of this party.
Previously, Bana<0xC5><0x9B> was associated with NIK in the years 1992–2005, he worked in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski.
During the first government of PiS (2005–2008), Bana<0xC5><0x9B> held the post of President of the Customs Service and, in addition, Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015 he again sat on the chair of the Head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has been managing the National Tax Administration.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> served as finance minister in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki for three months.

"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the order of the police will be punished
According to the newspaper, the disregard of an order of a certain behavior issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offense, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of freedom.
This change is what the unions want.
The idea came to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
“The case is serious, because now every year more than half a million criminal cases are sent to the Polish courts,” it reads.
“Rzeczpospolita” has determined that the petition that the Independent Trade Union of Police Officers writes to MPs on the amendment of the Code of Offences has a chance of success.
The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It should read as follows: “Whoever does not comply with the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the law, shall be subject to arrest, fine or restriction of liberty.”
“Paragraph 3 of this provision refers to the same punishment for those who, without following orders, will prevent or hinder the performance of official duties,” the newspaper reports.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in political matters of the demonstrations.
“In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be unfavorable and, instead of mitigating the situation, it would even exacerbate it,” he added.
According to statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively rated police interventions in 2018 and that every month the services take 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras worries about Europe
It's written in the blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today listed in a row with Václav Havel.
From the beginning, therefore, the curse of the talent hanged over Joachim, which he seeks to exploit.
Eight years later, he returned with "Sensitive Man."
The characters are Buras and So<0xC5><0x88>a together with their two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They're traveling actors, they're traveling around Europe.
He is a Shakespearean lover and thief, she is a one-eyed translator who does not part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys did not make a sound from birth, and for the other time stopped in infancy.
But it is not the heroes who are the most important in this story.
All are just a backdrop for observing a world in which there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It's a world of a stuffy province, a society of old, suspicious people and promiscuous youth.
"Sensitive Man" turns into absurd theater.
The narrative emulates the didascale, and the conversations of the heroes create this world.
The scene is a Europe full of fears about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Brussels Airlines cancels 105 flights due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy
Although British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is in operation.
However, the company has problems.
Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All office trips that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Ghent also announced the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are staying abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now “fully operational” despite the British parent company’s announcement of bankruptcy, which caused concern among employees and customers.
At the time, the office was reassured that the customers who bought the trips in it would go on holiday.
Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest and largest travel agency, has filed for bankruptcy overnight.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse on Sunday of last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors.
Creditors demanded that in addition to the <0xC2><0xA3>900m rescue plan agreed in August, the company raise an additional <0xC2><0xA3>200m as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnover.
However, the company’s problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of up to 1.6 billion pounds.

“I don’t think Slovenia played fantastically.
We played very poorly.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for German Görlitz visitors.
Actions are intended to help fight the progressive decline in the population of the city.
Görlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, as The Guardian reports, the city is struggling with significant problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a constant decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, resulting in a 25 percent decline in the city's population.
In 2013, it reached 54 thousand people.
To fight depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted.
Two-thirds of them were made up of residents of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the program.
“When we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the project participants.
“Now we feel it doesn’t matter if we stay here after four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has seven thousand vacant homes, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get the opinion of the participants of the program.
The information gathered from the interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revitalise smaller German cities.
“We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what their motivation was,” said program manager Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for living and working in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in American Tulsa in Oklahoma.
