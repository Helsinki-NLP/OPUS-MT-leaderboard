The social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the preservation of the privilege for travel in public passenger transport.
Since September 24, the procedure for organizing preferential travel of citizens using the social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region has changed.
According to the press service of the Government of Russia in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of the privilege for travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 of the Federal Law "On the national payment system".
At the same time, the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions of its application change.
Thus, the limit of replenishment is set now not in travel, as before, but in the amount of cash, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter no more than 400 rubles, in summer - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now, holders of a social card on the receipts issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of funds.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff valid for the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule for replenishing the social card with cash remains the same - in the period from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social card will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it becomes possible to keep a detailed record of spending money on the social card with accuracy to kopecks.
In addition, it is possible to return credited but unspent funds.
We will also add that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half of the cost of travel is paid by a citizen, and the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier by the budget.
No commission will be charged when depositing money on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the Department of road and transport of the Ivanovo region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using the social map, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
The regional budget for the provision of preferential travel of citizens using a social card provides for more than 470 million rubles.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a 911 call, a teacher confesses to the murder of a friend
During a 911 call, Shannon Lamb, a university professor, told police that he had shot his girlfriend and needed staff to come to their home.
Lamb said there was a "dog" in the house that was alive but probably upset, and said the contacts of the deceased's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note casually handwritten on a white sheet of lined paper: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could get it all back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who has ever loved me," the note said, according to authorities signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to indicate that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then travelled 300 miles to the university campus, where police believe he shot and killed respected history professor Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Baford said the university learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that truthful 911 call shortly afterwards.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb committed suicide as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, the authorities were still trying to put together the motives that prompted Lamb.
The information shared by investigators on both sides of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to make a portrait of a talented but perhaps worried teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gauthier, where Prentiss was killed, said he was not charged with violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he had written, in which he expressed his appreciation for the "beautiful people" with whom he had intersected in his teaching life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for the emergence of problems.
One student who spoke well about Lamb, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year about how he struggled with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university recruitment rules meant that the doctorate Lamb worked so hard to obtain would not guarantee him an automatic teacher position.
William Laforge, the university’s president, said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “obviously Mr. Lamb had something on his mind.”
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police attacked Lamb's trail after he escaped from campus as he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a 38-caliber single-shot pistol in the backyard of his home, one mile south of his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Metel Johnson said.
His car with the engine running was still standing in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb came to the house, although Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those areas.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful man.
Carla Haarston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who had been trying to teach her to play the guitar for several years.
In those years, he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls melted when he was around," says Hareston, now in her 40s and who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss seem to have been dating for some time now.
During a 911 call, Lamb said, “I killed my wife,” but there is no record of their marriage being registered.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gauthier in a brick house, the reverse side of which overlooks the canal.
Police say the dog is okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's very depressed," O'Steen said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he hadn't dated Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
They played together at concerts from time to time.
O'Steen said that his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the dimly lit The Julep Room bar in the outskirts of Gaultier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and accordion for the few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We laughed and laughed at each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, the deceased teacher, conducted seminars for freshmen and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at the University of Kansas at Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student self-government.
On the campus of the University of the State of Delta in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university professors, staff, students and community members, participated in a candlelight memorial ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was helped by Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a police statement that Lamb's call came to the 911 service after Schmidt's murder, and also in connection with the fact that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won’t be hiring as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, with the toy and baby goods retailer assuring it will give full-time staff and temporary staff the opportunity to work more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, less than the 45,000 that were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin interviewing applicants this month and will increase its staff from October to December.
Although there are still a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees in order to have enough staff in stores and for the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about ‘dating’ Princess Diana
The premiere of the film “Back to the Future” turned out to be a great event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the arrival of members of the royal family, I noticed that the place next to me is free, and then I realized that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me,” he said in the trailer for the documentary Back in Time.
The movie begins, and then it comes to my mind that I am literally at arm’s length and in one false yawn from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
“Back to the Future” premiered 30 years ago.
“For me,” Spielberg says, “it’s undoubtedly the greatest time travel movie ever made.”
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and in some theaters in October.
The head of the UN says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in response to Russia’s military support for Syria that there was “no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and the increase in weapons would only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief reiterated his call on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive talks to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council – the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France – during the General Assembly ministerial session this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the differences within the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, "made the situation insoluble".
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they had shown in addressing the issue of Iran’s nuclear program and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 Survey Results That Show Donald Trump Isn't Joking
Some tried to label him a provocateur.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
Some people want a scandal.
But as much as some Republicans try to shake the high position of Donald Trump in the results of the polls, they have not succeeded (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have demonstrated Donald Trump’s advantage in double-digit numbers, and some are starting to seriously question what this means for a real estate mogul in terms of chances of getting a nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry gave way to the gaining popularity of Herman Kane, none of whom won even one state in the process of nomination.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in a general election.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush’s “Super Committee of Political Activity” and the economic conservative group Growth Club recognize Trump’s unrelenting strength and are starting to pull out their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some survey figures that suggest that a real estate tycoon is not just an intermediate phase:
Sympathy ratings for Trump turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University found that only two out of 10 Republicans were positive about the real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Six out of 10 Republicans are now positive about Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators prevail in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there favored Trump.
Two-thirds of those voting for the GOP would suit Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “disappointed” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” against 40 percent of those who say the same about Trump).
The next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they would be “dissatisfied” or “disappointed” if establishment favorite Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Trump has been widely criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters across the country think he has the temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll Monday.
The same figure appears at the country’s first closed-door meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same man who could be commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he’s not the kind of person who can be effective in office, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament isn’t suited to the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their hats of connoisseurs, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
Asked who was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters didn’t have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle of the cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported a possible candidate Mitt Romney.
However, it shows that many GOP voters find Trump’s campaign convincing.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such a dispersion is likely to play into Trump’s advantage, and at the same time, those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among the supporters of more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always wins majority support.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He's got a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who gets around him?
Ben Carson overtook the businessman by as much as 19 points in the hypothetical one-on-one competition.
Just over half of Donald Trump supporters say they have changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of Trump supporters say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46% say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump’s most intense competition at the moment is with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve changed their minds are likely to pick Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “violators” two months ago in his campaign opening speech, the topic of immigration became the most topical in conversations in 2016.
Some worry that Trump’s pose will deter key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and hinder rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll on Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts general attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment with the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday in a new ABC/Post poll said they wanted a political outsider rather than someone with experience in government.
And they are also offended by Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago found that three out of four Republicans in Iowa were disappointed with Republican activity in Congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “furious.”
The government will decide the fate of pension indexation in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options to implement the law on the indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation.
She noted that a solution should be found by October 8, by the time the draft budget for next year is submitted to the government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the accumulative pension of Russians.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion rubles.
It is about the same as the indexation of pensions in full for the next year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is still no final decision on the question of who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong, at the same time, to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are the eyelids often irritated and reddened?
The doctor-ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova answers:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting about regular cleaning of the eyelids, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The exit is simple:
Do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, wear a special damp napkin for the eyelids;
At least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the eyelids from the harmful substances accumulated in them for the day.
Cleansing procedures should be supplemented with warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (sage, chamomile), diluting the thick secret of sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out in circular movements of the finger pads;
When rinsing makeup, do not use alcohol-containing products.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to an even greater thickening of the secretion of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear engineers created a nuclear warhead.
North Korean authorities said the country's main nuclear reactor, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, was operating "at full capacity".
This was reported on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to the “aggression and nuclear threat of the United States”, and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both in quantity and quality”.
The last nuclear test was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume full operation of the reactor have not been reported since.
Pyongyang claims to have created an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly conducted tests of medium and short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded to remove from the Russian anthem the mention of fraternal peoples.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the national anthem should remove the mention of the union of fraternal peoples.
He said this during a meeting of the State Duma, reports "Russian news service".
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand it," Zhirinovsky said.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the quadrilaterals, which contain this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to "God save the Tsar", and the Russian tricolor should be replaced by an imperial flag.
Assad called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad believes that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, then they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If Europeans care about refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That is our opinion on this issue.
"That's the essence of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is impossible as long as people die, as long as bloodshed continues, and as long as people do not feel completely safe.
“So we can reach a consensus, but we can’t implement anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria,” Assad said.
About 500,000 migrants have arrived in the European Union this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that among the migrants arriving in Europe may be thousands of militants of the extremist group "Islamic state".
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city organized a holiday for refugees.
Germany has become a leader in hosting refugees over the past month, though it has recently stepped up border controls to contain the influx.
Authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts cite significantly higher figures.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents give migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut in the session of questions to the Prime Minister
After the election of Mr. Corbyn, his debut at the session of questions to the Prime Minister is expected with great anticipation
The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon speak for the first time at a question session with the Prime Minister, competing for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six questions set aside in the afternoon; his speech is likely to be closely watched by the press and Labour MPs.
He called for “less theater and more facts” at a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said that he could skip some meetings, leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn’s first parliamentary test as leader; it will follow his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Trade Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to remain silent while performing the national anthem in service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, drew criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several front-page newspaper articles.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesperson for Mr Corbyn said he "standing in respectful silence" and acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, Mr. Corbin’s shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “regardless” of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbyn’s team, voicing disagreements over economic, defense and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political disagreements are also piled up in the Labour party after Mr. Corbyn’s appointment to a position in the European Union and the government’s restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbyn said at the Trade Union Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the idea of restrictions as a whole.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow minister of labor and pension payments, said the party was “fully clear” that it was only opposed to the government’s plans to reduce the ceiling from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will meet at the "courier box" in the last decade since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who had promised a different approach to politics, said he had “engaged collective resources” to gather questions for Mr. Cameron and had received more than 30,000 proposals.
A Member of Parliament from Islington North County said the Prime Minister’s questions were overly confrontational, and that he would refrain from witty answers and an exchange of cranks, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him on questions to the Prime Minister when he was absent – for example, when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor if possible, saying that he had approached House Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
Having become a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the political style of “fair balagaan”, often associated with the procedure of questions to the prime minister, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the prime minister's questions have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to govern the House of Commons, and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say it has become a caricature and requires major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg" Homeless young people who learned to be photographers
The business center of Johannesburg is a difficult place for the homeless.
But one group of former homeless found a way to master the craft and earn a living.
"I Was Filmed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the surroundings and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound Sterling Rises as Wages Rise in UK
The pound rose amid rising wages in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising thanks to a proposal to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate proved to be the highest since 2009, and was met with an earlier postponement of forecasts for possible increase in quotes.
The pound sterling rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505, and by 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6,229.21 by 1.49%.
SABMiller’s shares rose by 20% thanks to a bid from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world’s two largest breweries, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% amid encouraging news from rival luxury group Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales data exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it managed to raise $2.5 billion by placing shares, which was done as part of a debt-reduction strategy.
Shares of the paper and packaging group Mondi were the leaders in the fall in the index - by 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs downgraded the group to "sell".
Shares of JD Sports rose after the sportswear company reported an 83 percent increase in pre-tax profit for the six months to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages May Prevent Expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says raising the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in labor costs, he says.
The costs could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash Launches Bottom-Up Initiative Campaign to Combat Aldi’s Onslaught
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi’s onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
The wholesale food supplier has launched a bottom-up campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of Aldi’s upcoming $700 million infusion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and at events such as the Adelaide Show.
The campaign is joined by IGA retailers and suppliers, such as ice cream maker Simmo’s in Dunsborough, which offers tastings in IGA stores, and store owners selling discounted tickets to regular customers for South Australian Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29, the day this wholesale supplier of food, spirits and household goods will hold its annual investor strategy day.
A lot is at stake, as in South Australia and Western Australia, stores under the IGA brand account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show a higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as adherents of the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the U.S. and 24 percent in the WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will capture 5 percent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all present players, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year, and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, achieving sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of revenue and food sales at a high level of constant costs could cost the company about 13 million before interest and taxes, according to Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, and this despite the fact that a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash’s food sales to fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company’s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, Lead Stock Manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, noted at a business luncheon in Melbourne that Metcash “could be highly likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr. Douglass’ comments.
But a member of Metcash’s board of directors is believed to have contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash’s revenues from the food business, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, fell 43 percent from 2012 due to operational deletion and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million a year to equate retail prices with those at Coles and Woolworths at thousands of positions a week, and helping IGA retailers rebuild marketplaces, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider selection of branded food products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says price alignment and refurbishment of retail space are gaining momentum, and he hopes the company will achieve an increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis Supports Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves respect, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly hurt in the recent scandal around his friend Nick Kiryos and his behavior deserves more respect than criticism, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, Jr. in a talented duet and often called "Special Ks", unwittingly came into the spotlight because of a shameful altercation between Kiryos and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly afterwards, during the hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the referee on the tower had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, while Harrison stated: "Wavrinka should have laid on the shoulders of Kiryos, and I should have laid on the shoulders of this guy."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after a cramping in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Healy has been devoted to defending Kokkinakis.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grote for the right to be second after Bernard Tomich in the singles in the Davis Cup semi-final against the United Kingdom.
“I’m very worried about one thing, namely that Tanasi was drawn into the conflict,” Healy said.
He did break the racket when he lost his leg at the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break the racket when hopes were shattered, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But in fact he handled himself very well in pretty provocative situations on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I’m sure he’s trustworthy.
He’s surrounded by a great team, he has a great family, and I just think he’s been treated a little unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard, he fits perfectly into the team, he has never had problems with other players, he is respected outside the court, he trains intensively, he is in great shape, he is a very purposeful and developed young man and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also backed the decision to forgive Kirjos for an important match starting on Friday, believing a “mutual agreement” was the right way out for everyone, but hoping that the Canberra boy would return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the match and not on the arguments around [Kirjos]," Healy said.
And I think Nick gained strength very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray prove, he's growing in front of the public, he's made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and it's necessary, I think, to take him out of the spotlight for the best for him for a while, so he can think about them, and think about them.
Migration Crisis in Europe: Hungary Declares Emergency, Closes Border, Detains Migrants
By declaring a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday closed its border with Serbia on the southern border and is detaining those trying to enter the country illegally in order to contain a flood of migrants.
There were riots on the border - hundreds of migrants gathered in the border area, which was sharply negative reaction of the Serbian authorities.
After being stuck indefinitely on the road between the two countries ' checkpoints, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland set up tents and settled in the area.
However, dissatisfaction increased.
When a police helicopter circled over them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister has declared it “unacceptable” to expel migrants back from Hungary as more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
It is necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border began a day after the bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to take joint responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in crowded Italy and Greece and expressed hope that in the future (next month or by the end of the year) an agreement would be reached under which EU member states would take in another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, does not hope for swift action from Brussels or its neighbours.
A state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and expedite asylum lawsuits.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence on the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were connected to urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a major “bottleneck” and border crossing point for European Union settlers, many of whom are refugees – victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most of the people arriving in the country are economic migrants looking for a better life, not refugees - victims of hostilities that have the right to protection, and this view sharply contradicts the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now criminalise crossing or damaging a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison terms for people accused of human trafficking.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltán Kovács told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Officially, parliament is still due to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are at the border have been observing the presence of soldiers armed to the teeth with vehicles and dogs for days.
Orbán’s national security adviser, Gyorgy Bacondi, said authorities had captured 45 people trying to cross the border at the border itself, and another 15 inside the country.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, forcing a railway wagon wrapped in barbed wire to block one of the passages.
Riots erupted at the main passage across the border near the town of Röszke (Hungary), as Hungarians placed an office space to allow people inside a metal container, and crowds pressed each other to break in.
About 20 people managed to get inside, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced the refusal of food and water until they were allowed into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to participate in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 percent of primary Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary competition, most Democrats say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton retains a great advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has diminished.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is behind her by only 5 points.
Clinton’s preference for Democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and she and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overtook Sanders by a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
Nearly half of the Democratic primary voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party’s candidate.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support it just because it was a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, views are more controversial - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked openly why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 percent), then that it’s time for a female president (13 percent), and that she’s the best candidate for that post (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also talk about an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also called consensus on issues and chances of election.
As the vice president considers potential turnout in the election, 57 percent of primary Democratic voters would like him to join the race — though a third think he shouldn’t.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among party candidates, the Democratic primary voters in most cases call Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half said they would have chosen Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among racers to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chances of winning the general election; however, that figure fell from 78 percent last month.
By this indicator, Biden is far behind in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in answering the question of what is most important in a candidate, Democratic voters choose options other than the chances of being elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, showed good results on some key characteristics among the primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden is the leader of all three in honesty, and Clinton’s strength is in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of the Democratic primary voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and credible, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have a definite opinion of him in this regard.
Democratic primary voters also generally see similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden.
By all these standards, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton’s personal email box and server during her time as Secretary of State continue, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation in this regard and believe that it did not adversely affect their overall opinion of her.
But that’s a different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the story became known.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy hasn’t affected their overall view of Clinton, though 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
Mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10, say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by voters from her party, this continues to be a challenge for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it to be honest and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump, however, both get good marks on leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush scored best in terms of honesty.
Most see Sanders as an honest man rather than not, but as Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national poll, Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson approached Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
The two candidates won half of the vote in the new poll, leaving the rest in search of a foothold.
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose percentage of support increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll conducted on the eve of a Fox News debate last month to 27% in a survey conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson took off in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The poll also found Carson enjoys support across all demographics, pushing Trump out of a Republican voter group with higher education.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, rolled back with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson’s rise in polls – showing 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In response to Carson’s growing support last week, Trump made several criticisms of the former neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Killing Baruch College freshman
About two years after a college student was killed during a fraternity initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at New York's Baruch College brutally attacked Chan "Michael" Deng during the initiation ceremony in September 2013 and did not deliver him to the hospital on time, resulting in his death," police said in a statement.
Officials say a blindfolded student with a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times as he tried to reach the target by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 when Deng fainted, and were expected to wait an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
They, however, took the time to change Deng’s clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity’s national president, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, members of the fraternity began hiding personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity above Michael Deng’s health,” Wagner said.
He was unable to be rescued and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of fraternity initiation rituals, as at least one student has been killed during them every year since 1970,” Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County jury leaned in favor of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with violence against a rookie and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to hold not only individual participants accountable, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned it officially or unofficially, so is it,” Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the nationwide fraternity excluded the local branch from its structure.
What Happens When the Federal Reserve Raises Interest Rates
There will be a rise in rates, and the “bull market” will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will take before the attack, and how long it will last.
Specifically for the economy, history explains little about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for a full 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s rigidity in raising rates often, though not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
That’s why the U.S. central bank administration insists that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but on how much it will take to adapt.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
Eventually, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around raising rates is being exaggerated.
“The Federal Reserve’s first rate hike with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, chief international economics officer at Capital Economics, in a comment to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic impulse many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy might have responded to historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, expecting a rate hike can lead to volatility for a while.
With an increase in rates, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
“It doesn’t look like stock yields are slowing for 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent survey of the Federal Reserve’s rate hike results.
More specifically, the market is more likely to change dramatically over the past 35 years – around 14 percent – towards higher rates, staying fairly flat for 250 days afterwards (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returning to normal with an average return of 14.4 percent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Doll, Bar Management’s chief specialist in trading strategy.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to become more pronounced immediately at the stage of raising rates, and the earnings from shares begin to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often play into them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point for the entire duration of the increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of rate hikes since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will be for long, though it is only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates against such an unstable economic backdrop could be risky and raises the question “will it be different this time?”
Market participants are preparing for the Federal Reserve to raise rates all year round, with their eyes fixed on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategy experts and economists believe that the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading speaks of only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study, since 1950, all the cycles of rate hikes to date have been in a supercycle of rising financial leverage at GDP, overlapping peaks preceding a recession, very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest the Federal Reserve has waited for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, it has already lasted 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market expects interest rates to rise, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one implemented for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will come faster than for stocks when the federal system changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the yield changes the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate hike cycle, bond yields immediately fall,” Deutsche said.
Strategy experts from Charles Schwab believe that raising rates will bring long-term and short-term bond yield levels closer together, making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate, although “we are still afraid of yield fluctuations,” said Katie Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the policy of the Federal system.
“In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of a tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market with the tightening of the policy of the Federal system.
In general, companies doing their main business in the U.S. will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts will find themselves in a worse position, as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space, and their debt more expensive in the financial.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks are showing performance above the market for three months after the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to customers.
Financially stable companies outperformed unstable companies by an average of 5 percentage points for each rate hike in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also showed better performance than low-quality stocks, on average by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will be a big issue.
High-interest floating-rate debt firms will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange-traded transactions, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
“BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM,” said Conservative MP Andrew Bingham.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "decreasing standards"
Proves that it is becoming less and less different from a commercial competitor
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award was simply ripped off by the Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins, who came down on The Voice with the same criticism, was not the original.
“BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM,” the leader of MPs said, urging the broadcaster to prove that it is doing at least something that commercial companies aren’t doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public radio station appears to be “stupid” and is becoming less and less distinct from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems -- I don't like using the word 'simplification' -- but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that first came to my mind, in which you’re actually just copying what’s already in the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC CEO has denied the accusations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don’t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and making music is truly unmatched by anyone else.
“It’s also really important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new pieces,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davy argued that radio stations have to work much harder to attract an audience than in the past because Britons are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only creation of the BBC that was attacked for stepping on the heels of commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a talent music show that the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed due to its lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was done in a "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the corporation to "find a hit in its own home stable" next time it launches an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the ordering of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
The growth of Internet sales has slowed down as much as possible in August, and the blame for this may be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase in online sales by seven percent
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that November Black Friday could have contributed to the deterrence of spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of equalizing online sales, after recent data showed only a 7% increase during the first three months of 2015.
Total spending on online shopping in August showed minimal growth since it began to record in 2000, increasing by just five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of equalizing online sales, after recent data showed only a 7% increase during the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rates in previous years and go back to 2000, they always found a reasonable explanation,” said Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG’s sales index.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago, when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were given the opportunity to shop online, and that they could do so in any setting, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it’s coming out onto the plateau, and you can see the decline (growth).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers five times the average rushed to computers to take advantage of the bargains, thus knocking down a number of sellers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter a real battle for profitable purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every 5 is spent online.
As for products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more willingly than in fashion stores on central streets.
Muslims buried dead in crane crash in Mecca, and bin Laden's family sanctioned
Muslims Carry 29 Dead in Streets as First Funeral Begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims of the collapse of a crane at the main mosque in Mecca.
Dressed mainly in white, those present at the funeral filled the driveway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who set out on their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed by the sacred place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on parishioners.
The bodies were handed over for burial, and at the same time the Saudi king fined a construction company owned by the bin Laden family for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who died in the collapse of the crane in the main mosque, carried through the streets
Among the dead was four-child father Kasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arrow raised when the crane was not working.
The Arab version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press agency, says that Binladin Group is partially responsible for the collapse.
The English edition of the news agency did not tell about this detail, but said that the leaders of the company were forbidden to travel outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the fall of the crane in the courtyard of the main mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improper coordination with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the main mosque of Mecca, as part of large-scale construction work that is being conducted by the Binladin Group.
Bin Laden’s family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and is in charge of major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a traitorous son whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to take part in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in life for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials ordered the payment of one million rials (about <0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to the relatives of the deceased, and the same amount to the irreversibly injured.
The other victims will receive half of that amount.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is explained by the presence of Eastern European masters working for little money
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent of the Daily Mail
The British are said to set aside hammers and paintbrushes, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do work in the house.
If you know how to handle a hammer or skillfully paint walls, it seems that these days you are in the minority.
Because, according to the owner of the company B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring professionals-masters to do simple housework.
Veronica Laurie, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a network of home furnishing services, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craft goods, and simultaneously close 60 B&Q warehouses.
Ms. Laurie said she would like to see more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten decisions about shopping in the store are made by the weaker sex.
At present, most of the staff are men.
According to her, recent demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households consisting of single women, who are more engaged in the refurbishment of their homes than in the past, cannot be ignored.
Ms. Laurie said: “Our stores are still predominantly male.
Steps must be taken to achieve a balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the purchased goods are made by women.
Women play an important role in decision-making.
Ms. Laurie, one of five women at the helm of leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving an equal number of men and women among the directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including CEO and CFO.
Ms. Laurie said: “It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.

The time of the decision on the interest rate of the Federal Reserve of the United States
The world is watching a meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank, which for two days discusses the adoption of the most important decision - to raise or not to raise the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A Reuters survey of 80 economists found that just over half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would go for it last week now believe it will delay and keep the rate at the current 0-0.25 percent range.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero and start the process of normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working efficiently, the economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for change, but all speaks to their confidence that all chances are against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees enter the EU via Croatia.
"Open up!" chanted hundreds of refugees at the checkpoint Horgos on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border to displaced persons.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to explore other routes to the European Union.
One of them bypassing the closed border with Serbia lies through Romania.
The other is through Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some reports, buses carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the town of <0xC5><0xA0>idu on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Neboj<0xC5><0xA1>a Stepanovi<0xC4><0x87> assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to be treated humanely.
This is already a European problem.
It is not easy to solve it, no country in Europe can cope with this alone, and even more so a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is unyielding:
If someone calls himself a refugee, in Serbia he must fill in the necessary documents for this purpose.
And if he does not, then he will not be allowed into our country, because in Serbia it is quite safe.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometre fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to erect a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meymarakis: “Europe wants to help us”
Vangelis Meymarakis has been a member of center-right governments for years, leading the country to what the left considers a financial crisis.
Now he is the interim leader of the New Democracy party and is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with the journalist Euronews.
Euronews: Mr Maymarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meymarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, giving way to the SYRIZA coalition, but now, according to polls, the New Democracy has equaled it in popularity.
What has changed in that time?
Vangelis Meymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and economic growth prospects.
Now the country again has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare the promise with what actually happened.
Everyday life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation was improving, and this was the case for most Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Vangelis Meymarakis: The fact is that, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programs have been or are still in place, political forces and all the ruling parties have come together to implement the program on which they have agreed, without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country’s creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you comply with that agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meymarakis: In fact, we voted for Greece to move on the European path, because we have a good idea of the devastating consequences of leaving the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by subsidizing our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost if there had not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of how Mr Tsipras led the negotiations.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government during the first year in power wants to restore order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then, I am sure, all the commitments made, which cannot be fulfilled because of what leads to recession, can be negotiated again, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to assume that in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue the privatisations, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to reap the benefits of EU funding and the greater investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out when discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
Here is an example of the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that we are not talking about a fixed monthly income and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras’ ministers never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and poorly informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded an unsuccessful agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr Juncker, Hollande, Mrs Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we tried to implement the 2012 agreement in the best way, bypassing the sharp corners.
We are moving forward with reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price that the Greek government was willing to pay.
I was the speaker of parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that made up the government majority at the time.
And despite their serious ideological disagreements on key bills, we had a working parliament, and that was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations held outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation, which would have continued to improve if the process had not been interrupted by early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: In recent weeks, a massive flow of refugees has been moving through Greece.
What do you think about this situation and the reaction of the European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Meymarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we will have to deal with after we win the election.
And the reason is that the SYRIZA government did not act in this situation as it should.
In such matters, you should act ahead of time, because if the problem overtakes you, then only extraordinary measures remain.
And that's exactly the situation we're in.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA has done more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which is assisted by the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will allow to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are victims of the war in Syria, victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
This issue has a deeply humanitarian dimension, and we will stick to the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
The decision should be taken at the EU summit and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meymarakis: Thank you.

Man who opened fire at Delta State University leaves a note apologizing
After the shooting and murder of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was “sorry” about the first murder and would like to “take everything back,” the authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in Gaultier, Mississippi, reported that a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University called 911 around 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and also mentioned that there was a "dog" in the house that "wouldn't touch anyone," but was probably upset.
The police asked the name of the caller, but he did not name him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened fire.
Upon arriving at the scene, police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm sorry, I'd like to take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, and on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.
University Rector William Laforge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb was suggesting a romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, officials said on Tuesday there was “no information or evidence” of a “love triangle.”
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Sean O'Steen, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said that he and Prentiss have a daughter, who is 19, and that she is "consoling".
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the Sun Herald newspaper calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to police, Lamb called relatives on Monday at some point to tell them he “won’t go to jail.”
On the evening of the same day, when the police caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university's website, Lamb received a PhD in pedagogy from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
The Stars Who Lost Their Luck
The actor (left), in the photo with his son Redmond (right), went through several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime life partner Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United is out for a few months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
Whilst the defender is worried that he will not be able to go on the pitch for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during a reckless podcast by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute, when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or a day later, and then operated on.
It's awful - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and began to play fantastically, and then it happened.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the dressing room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and was not assigned a penalty.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged kick.
In a tweet, Shaw said: “Thank you all for your messages, words cannot describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will come back even stronger than I was.”
Manchester United is experiencing a misfortune with Luke Shaw after losing in a game with PSV
The defender of the British will have an additional incentive to recover for the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “This is a very serious injury.
When any player comes out with a similar injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the enemy.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when he played for Mexico against Holland under Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very difficult for him right now because he had no intention of hurting the enemy, and when you hear it’s a very serious injury, you don’t feel well,” he said.
I couldn’t see the moment itself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) had touched it, but I didn’t see the podkat under Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to take it.
It's very hard for me, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child liked a book, it will take a little time before you can know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
Asked about his favorite children’s book, the prime minister chose Lorax, an environmentally-minded tale written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
“This is a fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message that we’re missing.”
And everything would be fine except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the contents of the book, but actually tells the plot of the eponymous film, shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
"In the high-walled city of All-Nothingville, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams, fulfilling her desire - to see a real tree," we read in the text a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Seuss (real name Theodore Seuss), in 1991, died.
If this does not seem suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads almost like a summary of the plot of the film "Lorax", posted on the website of the Internet Movie Database: "In the high-walled city of All-Nothingville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, who is admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about how a greedy tree-cutter and knitter of "all-powerful" Nakhodkins destroys the environment.
Most likely, such a simple PR task was entrusted to an artist who never read a child a book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text allegedly came from Cameron’s office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comment followed.
For Adam Leath, there was clearly a risk of not getting into the England national team, but it's still a difficult question.
Winning over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the national team that England selected for this tour, repeating the 3-0 defeat in the test series, which happened last time, does not seem likely to me.
I wouldn’t rule out winning in my field either.
Alistair Cook’s team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are players among the strikers who masterfully accept twisted balls, and collective thinking is strong; they will not bring with them the scars of 2012, but only the youth positive.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a bowler serving twisted balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Litt dropped out of England test cricket team and replaced by Alex Hales
“The decision to eliminate Adam Leath is difficult for me, his head coach at Yorkshire, of course.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality is that cricket players are judged by the judges on the score.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I have already said this before) players are the best to choose themselves.
A couple of half-hundred, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in the grip of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he picks up more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, spoke well of his mood, even when he did not show what he was capable of, and that does not surprise me; he is first a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the batsman of the test cricket leaves an impression on himself is a difficult question.
Litt has played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Litt was at his best, but that missed opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's the batsman, which I rate highly.
He’s an unpredictable cricketer, which we saw at the Yorkshire club at the beginning of this season, when he made 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those who were before him, but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would make it possible to introduce an additional spinner while maintaining four speed bowlers, is under consideration, and I am not at all against it.
I don’t see why a hitter can’t hit the ball there, and this left-handed guy has already shown that he’s a damn good cricketer.
Mohan may not be exactly what is needed for his county of Worcestershire, but he became the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches as the “third batsman” before coming out as the opening one in 2001.
He immediately won three hundred and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and in my brief conversation with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his approximate stats — an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball — and think it’s a risky bet, but among the spinners voting “for” a little, and the pickers chose youth.
He will learn a lot from this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
Appointment of Mahela Jayauordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a master move.
He is one of the best guys for the game, who will bring to it the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and ruthless pace in the setup.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was a game or a coaching job, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has already been said, can give new strength to the team.
Colley's teammate Durham Ben Stokes is left for the day, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, do not have a problem with this.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and players do not set a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The camp of supporters of the exit of the UK from the European Union could win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron’s ill-thought-out policy of resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is experiencing more and more difficulties every day, even without looking back at the election of the genius Jeremy – “Is this yes or no?” – Corbyn as Labour leader or the TUC’s resentment over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that, with the situation in which the EU is now, experiencing various crises - not all of them of its own making - some member states are fed up with the British self-centered agenda of dissenting concessions and undermining agreements of changes that they mostly do not want.
Gathered in Brighton for the annual meeting, the TUC decided that it did not want them anyway if they were destroying social protection.
We could even call it "Dave and George's selfie program."
The prime minister and finance minister ride summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves against the backdrop of a famous local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or not, then come home and say that they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK interested in maintaining external contacts under the European Union's awning -- "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin -- suggests that cluttered ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s very cautious chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation gets worse for her, as it has worsened for those sitting in her place Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14 years old) and Kohl (16).
French President Francois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to see them crawling out of the skin to help the selfie Brits, whose energy could be wasted on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK – which they also don’t want because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to spur the UK’s exit from the EU, suggests a friend of mine.
“The revision was an idea-fix” and “Britain has received nothing of value from the resumption of negotiations.”
Europeans know for their misfortune what a predator Fleet Street can be and how skeptical media moguls are of the EU, unlike the time of Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 at a ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a steadfast Euro-opportunist who became famous for his “direct bananas of the EU” Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a bumpy company of tax-defying crooks, phone hackers, foreigners, and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was exactly the same way about them, but was aware that when you are in a cage with a ferocious gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and prevent her from eating you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was more supportive of Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron’s idea of a referendum, as Blair ceded principles in favor of the repealed EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him.
But sweet Jeremy Corbyn, who friendlyly patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday – I told him he didn’t have time to waste it on me anymore – seems to be risking repeating Neil Kinnock’s ‘80s Murdoch boycott’ strategy – a mistake both then and now.
It may take some time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy of engaging with the press — not with me, but with Andrew Marr, on whose couch he sat in the Air Force on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist Ukip trend and the wider circle of “Little England supporters” among the Tories can probably say “yes” to it.
It’s the same thing as Hillary – “Benn but not bennite” – Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner boy scout struggling to admit that Corbyn’s appointment of the intolerable John McDonnell as “shadow” Secretary of the Treasury was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father struggled on TV for disloyalty to his colleagues in the Labour Cabinet, without going too far and without losing his office in the Cabinet.
Hillary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay “in all circumstances” — Benn’s phrase — is not what McDonnell said, nor is it what J.K. said to peers and members of parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, according to popular opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and “my boyfriend” Corbyn wanted to say – remember, he even touched me – the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the whirlwind of social media, the hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s sensible not to let Cameron get away from Europe so easily, allowing him to take Labour’s support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But the fundamental misconception of McDonnell and Corbyn about EU membership – within the “Bennite” economy of a besieged fortress – is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, born of a slight distinction, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
Regarding his misconceptions about NATO, Tom Watson is unwavering in his belief that J.K. will not campaign for an exit – foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – on British concessions when it could all be meaningless?
The U.S. is already very disappointed by the weak military action of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as the Tory government in power cuts spending, as I was reminded on Monday during a lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England
The government-funded agency’s claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking were made at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with the Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published an important report last month, calling it a “comprehensive review of evidence.”
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized the “extremely shaky argument” on which PHE built its main conclusion.
In a BMJ article, two more researchers questioned whether the claims had "solid or shaky grounds."
Martin McKee, a professor of European health organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The fundamental principle of health – rules should be based on proof of effectiveness.”
According to them, the public expects PHE’s statements that “current best estimates show that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking” to be based on detailed evidence analysis and modeling.
In fact, this is derived from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model of multicriteria decision-making analysis in order to summarize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also validated BAT certifications in the health sector in the Sustainability Report.
One in 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette maker, without mentioning the funding he reportedly had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
No reasonable explanation was provided for the selection of the board members, but there are several well-known e-cigarette proponents among them, some of whom also claimed to have funded the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants in the meeting have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco department at PHE.
The scientific paper, published by the group, "elegantly agrees" that there is a lack of "substantial evidence of the harmful effects of most foods by most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links and restrictions were touched upon in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoke" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said BMJ’s statements had already been answered.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking.”
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All the evidence suggests that the health threats from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to explore the long-term consequences.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is being proven and what is not being proven by this evidence, especially where the public has had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2bn a year.
Having made clear the obvious – that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they only cause part of the harm caused by smoking – we are fulfilling our tasks before the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes that the BBC should stop the series EastEnders
The former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop releasing such programs as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would give a lot for such successful shows as the soap opera about “Alberta Square”.
Johnson noted that royalties should only be used to create such programs that are not produced by other British television and radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which probably only a small part of the audience watches, at peak airtime, when competitors have high-rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had at one time for six years unsuccessfully tried to establish cooperation with the BBC while working on Channel 4.
“I can’t shake the thought that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcasting programs that could be shown by competing companies that don’t receive subsidies,” Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of an investigation into the BBC’s future.
If you keep the license fee, which I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, then companies should only keep on the air those programs that are not released and are not going to be released by other companies.
The Voice show airs in the prime slot because the creators want to get the maximum possible support for the future.
The idea of no one showing it anymore is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don’t understand why regressive taxes should go to fund programs that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are of their own production.
Other channels would undoubtedly give a lot for it.
I don't understand how this can be public broadcasting.
I don't think that would have demeaned the BBC.
Johnson, the serial entrepreneur who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings “because of the ambitions of employees and because of their belief that this is the best way to get support for the long term.”
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo those of Sky executive Tony Ball, who in his 2003 lecture in memory of McTaggart in Edinburgh suggested that the BBC sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson noted that the BBC's more public-character niche broadcasts "continue to go on BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audience, but the function of the company is fulfilled, and this can be presented as an argument in profane sermons justifying the revenue from license fees of <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion: "well, yes, of course, we are doing all these incomprehensible broadcasts that no one is watching."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever look at them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system as to who will get the most out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds is big money, I wonder, they think so because they don’t really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reconsider Rita’s mission in favor of “inform, educate and entertain.”
He noted that now only a small part of the BBC’s content is formally classified as educational – it is 1% of television content and 0.1% of radio content – and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto “inform, educate and entertain”.
Regarding the partnership, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as Promenade Concerts (only some of them, he said, are shown on TV), as well as enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
Sonogenetics allows you to control brain cells with sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have developed worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using pulses of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction at the moment when they are affected by sound impulses too high for the human ear to hear.
The pulses have an effect by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Researchers control brain activity with the help of light
The scientists said that the worms demonstrate the capabilities of a new technique called "sonogenetics", the essence of which is to use ultrasound to excite certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Shrikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation — an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to a person’s brain and which is used to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Nematode worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to respond when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the body of worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves affect structures called "TRP-4 ion channels" found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to the worms, so that their motor neurons used the ion channels of TRP-4.
During the application of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and injected into worms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that compared to this technique, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the desired area of the brain via fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass seamlessly through the body's tissues, so they do not need to pass inside the skull for delivery.
"We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical settings, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can temporarily make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound signals," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements mock the British arms trade
Watch the video of Amnesty International protesting against the exhibition of weapons.
Amazing killer drones!
Iron shackles destroying the shin!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise batons that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoons leave no doubt that this advertisement for the largest international arms show is a corrosive parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government’s intention to “push” weapons to repressive regimes by taking advantage of the defense technology and security system exhibition held at the ExCeL center in Dockland.
DSEI Arms Exhibition: Authoritarian Regimes Go to London
But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of a lot of posters at bus stops and on subway trains, which require you to look at them again.
“An important announcement, traveling on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?” – written on one of them in the fonts of the London subway with the image of the DLR line turning into a silhouette of a tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will rush to the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters are painted by artists who exhibited their work at the “Museum of Cruel Design” in Banksy Park “Dismaland”.
A team called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them across London using a “ad space burglar kit,” a 6-pound set of wrenches that allegedly “gives access to about a third of the advertising space at the planet’s bus stops.”
Transporters in London are not happy with such “vandalism” in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody ads issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and eager to bring political art to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists start working with activists of protest movements, realizing that they have to go into the real world for the sake of their art, if they want to influence society.
Another anti-arms poster welcoming passengers on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by VCCP, a pro bono agency, with the involvement of a graphic designer and voice artist, who also work for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence surrounding the arms show – with a pass on the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They thought of creating more realistic and ingenious corporate advertising, but “filling it with bright colors and animation at home turned out to be more exciting.”
“They have been incredibly helpful in bringing attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” said Amnesty’s Tom Davis.
Now we need the UK government to take action to ensure that this mining equipment is not illegally sold right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the theme of the arms exhibition comes from inside the ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed information about the order for "AT4CS RS for shooting from the shoulder", received from the US army.
It includes an "unparalleled cumulative warhead that brings unsurpassed armor action inside the target."
No matter what he does, it won’t be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
It’s been 11 years since I moved into the dorm as a normal 19-year-old who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but it’s only now that I remember the drawn smiles of those I’ve bothered – and the numerous, long complaints about others.
Basically, what I learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm can vary from mildly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
He encourages chatting: telling people where you came from, whether you took an academic leave and where you spent it, whether you support Corbyn and why you "honestly, neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract of HAHAHA, I'll be at my place."
Take a break.
And help others to rest too - ask questions and show interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn’t even talk to even if your eyelashes caught on fire and they were giving out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking establishments, midnight movie halls, and places of social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and fix their underwear.
Don’t even think about starting a university while in a relationship.
Introverts are treated unfairly in universities.
Your room should be a sanctuary, however, many dorms form a culture of swaying from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long-lasting friendships.
It could be hell for someone trying to regain their strength.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to keep being friends with you, but I need you to leave and I can regain the energy I spent communicating with you.”
Try to feel when a classmate is tired of communication - and do not knock on it, but send an SMS.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
One guy in my dorm followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends by baking.
As you start your university life at the peak of Bake-Off popularity, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate biscuits is not such a strange action, not so much like the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I baked you something, and now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions."
Offering home-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end, probably, your face will be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Poorly bonded lumps of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, stealing someone's chicken is stealing, but is it stealing to take a little milk for tea?
Talk to the owner of the milk.
Most likely, he will ask you not to be shy, even if inside he is boiling with rage.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you - but try to treat it more maturely than my neighbor, who poured dishwashing liquid into her milk to get revenge on those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the saying about glass houses.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbor to turn down the drum and bass because it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours, then slammed her music and locked the door behind her, leaving for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse lived in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extremely awkward, before you bite your elbows, if you took your neighbor for your future spouse, got carried away with him, broke up relationships and had to see him every day, and maybe watch him drag all your common friends to his side?
Of course, you can't tell your heart - but if a hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own passion a little.
In the exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but turns into its opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never stain someone else's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else’s door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you will then put in the freezer – but do not glue other people’s things to the ceiling with Blu-Tack glue more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on the iPhone after the release of the update from Apple
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings application, select General, and then - Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error message appears telling them that "Application Update Failed".
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait for the recovery to subside or try to upgrade via iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may involve deleting apps to increase free space – but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also simplified execution with a dedicated utility that suggests deleting apps and reinstalling them after the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that when performing the update, your phone is charged or is next to the charger to prevent the battery from being discharged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as discharging the phone in the process may cause the update to fail.
iOS 9 comes out on schedule, despite the delay WatchOS Review of iOS 9: the least impressive and the best update of iOS 9: how to prepare for the new operating system for iPhone

Washington responded to Russia’s military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
According to him, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only leads to an aggravation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about this with his Russian counterpart, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activities in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia’s continued support for President Assad risks exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, as well as adversely affecting our common goal of fighting extremism, if we do not also continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through a direct transfer of power,” the State Department said in a statement.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the U.S. commitment to the fight against the Islamic State in the framework of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of it.
In addition, the United States "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in trying to counter the Islamic State."
On Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the time for a phone call between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet come: “When the president decides that a phone call with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make that call.”
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime a "losing bet".
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make things worse.
"But he did not heed my warnings - and as a result, the situation has worsened," he said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating equipment for recreation and sports from paying customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This "Izvestia" reported Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following a trip to Crimea, instructed a number of agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the FSB, the Federal Customs Service, and Rosturizm - to prepare proposals to create favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to store their ships abroad - about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million annually goes to the treasury of European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amendments to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes", providing for the provision of full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes in respect of imported yachts and other floating equipment for recreation and sports.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, - Lashkina said.
This issue was submitted for consideration by the Subcommission on Customs and Tariff, Non-Tarif Regulation, Protection Measures in Foreign Trade of the Governmental Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also approved by the departments.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure for full conditional release at import is in essence a privilege.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommission in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will make a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EAEU member states, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to facilitate foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for use in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc. Among them - service equipment (personal computers, typewriters, etc.)
The press service of the Ministry of transport of the Russian Federation "Izvestia" told that prepared mandatory resolutions on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for registration of entry and exit of small, sports sailing and leisure vessels in the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport gave instructions to the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for the entry of small, sports sailing and leisure vessels into the sea port and the exit of these vessels from the sea port.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared draft orders of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the boundaries of the seaports of the Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been taken, the rest are at the stage of coordination, - the press service of the Ministry noted.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and examination, state registration in relation to small vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there is a whole constantly developing industry in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything stands still.
Our coast is uninteresting, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that in this area there are extremely strict rules of the border service: in order to go out for a walk on a yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
In addition, inside Russia yachts even nowhere to refuel.
For two days it can go with its fuel, and then the problem arises where to get it, - says the director of sales of the company Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
As for yacht storage, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also, yachts are sent for storage to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are wealthy people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts decreased.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
“The new funding will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine,” the statement said.
World Bank Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Tsimyao Fan said that the reforms of the banking sector will help revive credit in the real economy and will stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But due to the seriousness of the problems, Fan urges the Ukrainian government to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million loan to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reported.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
At the Public Council of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestites in the colonies will be discussed.
About this "Izvestia" said the member of the council Vladislav Grib.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia, undecided with the sex, in domestic prisons it is possible to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transgender people.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine the punishment of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicts have passed the relevant medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is really a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that isolating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice is successfully operating abroad: in the detention center (where the accused are pending a court decision), separate cells for transgender people are provided, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
This is the only way to deal with such criminals.
They definitely need to be isolated, as the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN employees.
The humiliation of trances by cellmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big a city, how many criminals with uncertain sex, you need to calculate where to distribute them.
Individual detention centers are definitely not needed - only cells, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
According to Mushroom, the block can contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is created in Russia alone, then inmates transgender people will be able to serve their sentences there from any region.
Citizens are detained in the detention center at the place of the crime, so the arrival of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for convicts already in a separate colony - yes.
We will remind, on the eve of law enforcement officers were not able to decide in which detention center - male or female - to determine the detainee for possession of drugs 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), because of which a man with a maiden appearance was not arrested.
He was released home on a non-exit subscription.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and the media, since the mechanism of detention of transgender people in detention centers and colonies in Russia does not exist yet.
Russian human rights activist, activist of the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolay Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for serving sentences by transgender people, noting that it is also possible to define people in a colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals, - says Alekseev.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially since there are more in prisons than transgender people.
At the same time, Alekseev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are ready to impersonate transsexuals in order to get into a different colony from the usual ones.
Of course, you can introduce a medical examination before placing people in a transgender colony, but not always everything is unambiguous.
For example, in the United States, one of the inmates Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in prison said that he wants to change gender, - said Alekseev.
A person can feel anything.
But while there are no separate places to serve sentences for transgender people, I doubt that prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people and delve into the intricacies of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transgender criminals in the colonies could greatly delay the start of serving sentences by convicts.
A commission is created - this is a question of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, this is not a single test, on the basis of which a high-precision conclusion is made.
Today’s psychiatry allows for this.
Therefore, before a sex change, potential patients always undergo such examinations - they accurately show whether a sex change with surgery is a necessary measure, says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to convicts, because on average such a survey takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general he supported the idea of creating separate blocks for transgender people, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it will be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, - transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if we take into account that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, then we can say that transgender people are even fewer, and those who have such a deviation and even commit crimes, a very small number.
Now, at the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgender people can receive separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk, the World Chess Championship among juniors under 20 years of age ended.
The ending of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and it was the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to catch up with the Pole Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who seemed confidently going to the title.
The girls celebrated the victory of the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Bukasa.
The World Chess Championship, held from the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already in the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all intrigue, as the representative of Poland Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who issued a series of four victories (competitions are held according to the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently took the lead.
Given that Duda was a ranking favorite of the championship, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he will miss the gained gap, it seemed very insignificant.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the lag to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov, in order to catch up with the leader, it was necessary to win in the 13th round.
But even that wouldn't help, win Dude's game.
Plus, this mandatory victory, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for Duda, who met with Benjamin Bok, to finish his game.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player drew the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
Therefore, it was to him that the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, whose Governor Natalia Komarova traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, presented the main prize.
But in the girls' competitions an intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Bukse (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Buksa.
The Russian athlete remained second with a lag from the champion in 0.5 points.
Vympelkom changes the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East into the East region.
The project will be completed by November 1.
According to Mikhail Slobodin, CEO of VimpelCom, the changes are being carried out in order to “remain a strong player in the market”, to develop the company “in new, not always favorable external conditions”.
In an interview with Russia 24, Mr. Slobodin said that they intend to reduce "tens of percent" of staff in Russia.
Rospotrebnadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King diners and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolamsk highway was fined 50 thousand rubles, and the institution on Big Tula Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed operation after eliminating all violations.
43 diners violated the requirements for the arrangement of premises.
Among other violations, unsatisfactory sanitary-technical and sanitary-hygienic maintenance of premises, non-compliance with the requirements for ventilation, in some institutions, bacteria of the E. coli group were found.
The franchise for the Burger King brand belongs to Burger Rus LLC, the owner of the chocolate chain Alexander Kolobov, 293 diners operate in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, the head of the FAS, said that the agency is against the indexation of 10% of tariffs for freight transportation and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by Russian Railways.
First they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and also multi-billion-dollar subsidies from the budget,” he says.
We say: it is wrong, it is too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, "much stricter" proposals, which are now being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of executing a put option on shares worth $300 million, the gold mining company said.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of the shares in favor of Sumeru and market quotes), which can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to exercise the option or demand a surcharge.
The details of the negotiations at Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of Polymetal of the Kyzyl project in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Department of Housing Policy of the Ministry of Construction, said that the Ministry, together with the Central Bank, is developing a procedure for the rehabilitation of developers.

The second draft is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final plan of the film.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade: targeted food aid will not become an analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Yevtukhov said that the program of targeted food aid will not be an analogue of the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food assistance to the population and support for an effective domestic commodity producer.
I ask you not to speculate on the phrase "food card".
I would like to note in particular that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed food cards with the echo of the past times of total deficit, the card distribution system, in which the amount of products received is normalized.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation," Yevtukhov said.
Earlier, Kommersant wrote that the program for the introduction of food cards for the poor was introduced into the government.

This year, the research of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" comes out for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian senior managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the laureates of the last year’s rating.
Winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate of the current year’s rating and nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list is invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which it would be advisable to add to the general pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following heads of functional areas of the company: Finance Director, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, Human Resources Director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Authorities, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each manager proposed by experts is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate their management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of candidates on the industry principle is carried out on the basis of the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forestry industry, mechanical engineering, media business, metallurgy, multi-profile holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, industrial sector, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, finance.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to log in to the site www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and can submit their assessments according to the criteria proposed for each functional area.
The basis of the methodology for building the rating is the principle of "The best choose the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows you to get the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of expert commissions.
All interested candidates of the rating of the current year and multiple candidates of the rating of past years are invited to the full-time meetings of the expert commissions.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for the approval of the list of senior managers and eight commissions for the approval of heads of functional areas.
At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly according to the Internet assessment and are closed information until the publication of the rating) or make updates to them according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of "Kommersant".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April of this year fell by 40%.
What do you estimate is the situation today?
After the panic of the end of 2014 - beginning of 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Loans at 25-30% per annum were not profitable to anyone.
If earlier the bank could put in an increased rate all its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-refunds, now it is impossible to do: the rates are already so cloudy.
For business, the current level of rates on SME loans is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
A rate level of 10-13% would allow the business to invest in a wide range of projects and form an attractive return on them.
How much do you think the entrepreneurs’ demand for loans is being met?
After the fall of the central bank interest rate, the situation improved slightly.
Loan resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of its development and future income.
Today, business has one solution: it is necessary to learn to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to monitor the flow of funds.
At the same time, with the availability of financial resources, it is worth using new technologies that allow to modernize equipment, reduce production costs and energy supply.
All this ultimately allows the company to make products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends of the SME lending market will be strengthened and will affect its development until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lowering the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator demonstrates consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, a radical drop in the price of loans for SMEs is not to be expected.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes it necessary to raise the interest rate to generate real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even with a decrease in the rates of the Central Bank.
If we talk about the level of overdue, then traditionally small and medium-sized companies, limited both in the possibilities of replenishment of funds and in the options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk for creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the proportion of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written in Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
And the new crossover CX-5, as, however, and any other model of the brand: without pretentiousness attractive on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
The Japanese, simply because of its "Japanese" is able to bring the attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete delight.
You can as much as you want to bring arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and a person even in principle will agree with these arguments, but the whole conversation crumbles from the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only the technique, but everything else is Japanese.
Quoting from the movement of Basa, seasoning wasabi food, collecting katanas and dressing his girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but according to the canons of Japanese street fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps the Japanese school uniform is the only uniform that girls wear with pleasure after school.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the grille with five horizontal lines.
But much more changes the appearance of the car a new pattern of headlights and taillights, by which the car is instantly recognized in the flow of cars.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance at the same time has a touch of severity.
You don't have to call the police.
Driving the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can only experience the stoic Japanese tranquility.
The 2.2-litre diesel engine delivers high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 hp. h. - only 5.9 l. The power unit is equipped with an exclusively automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.
Black boots, black cloak, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that you do not drive the CX-5 at the scene of your own accident.
To further increase comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension has redesigned the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the sleeve of the front lower levers.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and the engine at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
A swimsuit in a flower or stripe is just as boring as a budget sedan.
It is different if the girl is peeing in a swimsuit with an original pattern.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-playing action.
It is no less interesting than the new CX-5.
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both the front and rear seats, which provides an optimal margin of space for both wide shoulders and long legs - who has what.
Even long-legged ones will surely appreciate the fact that the stops in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in the turns.
The widest range of active safety systems Mazda is offered on the CX-5.
In order to recognize a potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used here.
There's adaptive lighting, and lane departure warning, and dead zone monitoring, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in its class.
Convenient, with a minimum of protrusions, it accommodates a load of 561 liters. The rear seats are folded in a 4:2:4 ratio - with each section equipped with a separate remote lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 liters.
The costume of the hero of the cartoon in Japan is called "kigurumi".
The kigurumi pyjamas are particularly attractive.
You can do anything in it!
Sleep, of course.
But also to entertain small children.
Or just to walk such an animal on the street...
After all, it is so great when you have the opportunity to choose - funny clothes, manner of behavior or a car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the Kawaicat store.
Kiev has broken the atomic union.
Kiev officially issued the refusal of Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday on the second attempt still voted for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to begin the implementation of the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law terminating the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth blocks at the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The bill submitted by the government of the country was able to pass only with the second vote, the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the necessary minimum of 226, but then 234 deputies voted for the draft.
The Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant laid down in the USSR according to the original project was supposed to have four power units of 1 GW with VVER-type reactors, but only two managed to be built.
Negotiations with Moscow on completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, in 2011-2012 the Rada adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the blocks would have to be built on credit from the Russian side, but the funds were not allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in the relations between the two countries, Kiev began to reduce relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing its refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only sphere in which relations have been preserved is the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (providing about half of the electricity generation in the country), since so far there is nothing to replace the Russian supplies to the Ukrainian NAEC Energoatom.
The plans to complete the Khmelnitsky NPP with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: back in 2014, Kiev announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.
The UN Secretary-General is against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be resolved by military means.
“There is no military solution,” he said when asked about Russia’s military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also said he would hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
“The meeting will be on Syria,” he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of creating an air force base in Syria in the future.
There are no such plans yet.
"But anything can happen," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier, Kommersant reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to fight the Islamic State terrorist group, which is banned in Russia.

The OSCE PA reports on a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of Ukraine’s delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Artur Gerasimov, announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in southeastern Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and “return to normal life of our countries”.
Asked whether, in his opinion, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia is currently possible at the parliamentary level - in the Normandy format or in the format of a contact group on the OSCE PA site - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, in Kiev support any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, ex-president of the country Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not fundamentally changed their positions at the trilateral talks, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections to the city Duma for the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy mandates, drawn on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections were made by representatives of the Communist Party, accusing the election of “covering up falsifications”.
The opposition's comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the election committee refused the party “Communists of Russia” in the organization of a referendum on the abolition of the fee for the overhaul of apartment buildings.
The City Election Committee officially presented the results of the elections in the Gorduma of Nizhny Novgorod for the municipal constituency.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the voter lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand ballots were issued to the district commissions, and 268 thousand voters voted in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were allocated to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia" six seats in the pride are Dmitry Swatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR received the leader of the party Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the Communist Party are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of “Fair Russia” go to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates have to decide whether they will serve as deputies in the city duma: in case of withdrawal from the mandate, he moves to the next candidate on the list.
The chairman of the election commission Alexander Makeev told the members of the commission that he was putting on duty to “send telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others” for the purpose of refusing mandates.
In approving the protocol on the election results, representatives of the Communist Party claimed multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the City Election Committee with the right to an advisory vote from the Communist Party, proposed not to recognize the results of the voting in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that by order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district, the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, was closed.
For a long time, neither the deputies of the State Duma, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers could go inside, and a resonant scandal with the assault on the doors of the district administration was shown on television.
All observers and members of the committees with the right of deliberative vote had the opportunity to attend the meetings of the district commissions.
Their head stopped access only when the voting was over and the precinct commissions had not yet arrived to hand over their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was amended, and at all meetings interested persons could be present," Natalia Andryushina, a member of the mountain election committee, said.
Communists objected that in the blocked building of the administration for more than four hours illegally detained deputy of the deputy of the deputy of the deputy assembly of the region Lyudmila Aristov, about which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that in a number of UICs on election day began to seal the urns at 6-7 a.m., placing ballots for early voting in them.
At the same time, the members of the commissions with the right of deliberative voice and observers were not notified, so they arrived at the beginning of the elections at 8 am.
The Communists believe that in the morning hours before the opening of polling stations in the urns could uncontrollably throw ballots.
However, the Election Committee, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeev, has not found any violations with instalments of unrecorded ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from “Fair Russia” Maria Popova to come out with amendments to the regional legislation through the leeching board in order to clearly set the time of opening of envelopes with ballots of early voting, which then fall into the urn.
"On your own initiative, at least contact the CEC," advised Mrs. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, the chairman was attacked with loud accusations by CPRF member Sergei Samokhin, who shouted that the election committee ignores dozens of complaints and covers election fraud.
"You are not here at a rally, be careful to declare!" - the chairman of the election committee was offended.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
By September 27, the election commission must approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the city Duma of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused the political party "Communists of Russia" to register an initiative group for a local referendum.
Judging by the documents, the parties were going to bring to the discussion of Nizhny Novgorod residents two questions: do they agree that the fees for the renovation of apartment buildings should be “immediately abolished”, and tariffs for housing and utilities should be “frozen until 2020”.
However, the lawyer of the Duma Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of the “Communists of Russia” is contrary to the law.
FedEx’s revenue is mixed, with lower forecasts for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results in the last quarter, and the delivery service giant downgraded its annual profit forecast amid falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx said it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-orders 45 minutes before the stock market opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts assumed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast is down despite an average rate hike of 4.9 per cent that will take effect on January 4 and an increase in land charges for heavy or bulky goods starting in November.
The company said it still plans to increase revenues compared to last year due to spending cuts, higher gross revenue and increased online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "worked steadily given the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
Plans to hire workforce during the holidays were announced the day after a competitor, UPS, announced they were planning to hire an additional 95,000 employees, roughly the same number as they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research in a survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
The six analysts polled by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered a downturn in the international express freight sector in recent years, leading to a lack of gross revenue growth in its express freight division.
However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from ground transportation increased by 29%, but operating revenues remained unchanged overall due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express freight unit received higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector income fell due to higher wage costs.
In the pre-trade about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange, FedEx shares fell by $ 3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, dropping 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve officials will spend two days this week at a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table deciding whether it’s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At one end of the richly decorated meeting room, two stories high above them, will hang a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the country’s economic interests above all others.
The central bank received a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the federal system have acknowledged that there is a third, unwritten assignment: financial stability.
And this third assignment may prove to be an unknown factor in the near-forecast decision announced on Thursday as to whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data shows strong economic growth, recent turmoil in global financial markets may deter already cautious leaders of the Federal system from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject to consider,” said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However, I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the world market would be enough to justify them waiting further,” she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of economists recently polled by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate hike this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the federal system to refrain from doing so, with the key indicator showing only a roughly 30 percent chance of a rapid recovery.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that decision-makers do not soften the blow by promising that the next raise will not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599.85.
The upswing was triggered by expectations that the policy makers of the federal system would leave the stakes this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the federal system raises rates at this point in time," he said.
If the Federal Reserve does so, “they will have to go far in approving their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that the rate hike could reassure financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system seems to have leaned toward raising interest rates by 0.25% this month, taking the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed in August, the growth of the labor market has been stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and nearly at what the federal system considers full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to fall below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the Federal System’s leadership said the key reason was the temporary effect of the sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy “can cope with and needs higher rates, given the shrinking labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The average Dow Jones index for industrial stocks fell by as much as 16% in May, a record high, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could slow global growth.
The market partially recovered this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below its high May value.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve system, market outrage further complicates difficult calculations of the term of the interest rate increase.
“In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have started to twist the nuts at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve.
Now, he predicts, they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is great uncertainty about what the consequences might be for the U.S. economy, and they have almost no credible data after recent events in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not a major concern of the federal system, and it should not technically be taken into account in making these decisions.
But essentially the Federal Reserve has become the world’s financial power.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
A mere hint from then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could “mute” its monetary expansion caused a shock to markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, one would expect the Federal Reserve not only to monitor developments everywhere, but also to consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “rather an art than a science,” said Zachary Carabell, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “there have been instances in the history of the Federal Reserve system of overreacting to financial market movements that don’t seem to be tied to economic principles.”
Lacker, a member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who insisted on a rate hike, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the federal system to cut its base rate by 0.75 percent over three meetings, “despite limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, the heads of the federal system canceled these cuts.
The Federal Reserve should put stability first only in times of major crises, such as the 2008 market crash,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The latest panic did not come close to that level, he said.
“You certainly wouldn’t want to be in a situation where you’re scared of rising rates because markets are going through a shock,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for the World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don’t think they should be ahead of the curve.

Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually not difficult to find.
State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the United States deliberately destabilizes the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees rush to Europe.
According to Interfax, this opinion he expressed to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question arises: is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who have in recent years destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East with such maniacal persistence?” he asked.
“Someone probably assumed and knew that the flow of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are fleeing death, will rush to the prosperous countries of the EU,” he added.
Naryshkin asked: "Have many political leaders in Europe spoken out openly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally overwhelming their countries?"
“No, old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to remain silent,” he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.
“Unfortunately, Europe has long and unbiasedly looked and looks at how the military boot, sewn according to NATO standards, is trampling on both moral ideals and the basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” the speaker said.
Government forces and their loyal paramilitaries are confronted by insurgents, mostly Islamists.
Later, the opponents of the Syrian government were joined by the Islamic State, a terrorist group banned in Russia.
The U.S. supports the rebels who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
Damascus considers these rebels to be terrorists.
The Syrian president called the reason for the West's dislike of Russia.
The West’s claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, Channel One, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another in his place, who will act in the interests of Western countries, and not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of the Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
For them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “has turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West.”
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West’s constant statements that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves, then at the request of the people, and not by the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communique.
“If the people want him to stay, the president stays, otherwise he should leave immediately,” he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded that cooperation with them is underway.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
“Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out,” he said.
As for the other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ISIS coalition led by the United States," Assad said.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000 people, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the Islamic State terrorist group, which is banned in Russia.
The international coalition led by the United States is carrying out air strikes on the positions of ISIS.
In Utah, 12 people died from flooding.
In Utah, at least 12 people have died as a result of flooding.
Another one is reported missing, reports Fox 13 Salt Lake City.
Water washed several cars with people in them in Washington County.
One of them, the van where the family was staying, stopped in a dangerous area near the water, and the stream suddenly overtook him.
The youngest victim was four years old.
All the dead are residents of Colorado City and Hilldale, which were hit by the elements.
Three children were also reported to have been rescued.
650 teams are involved in the search and rescue.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: World: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the State Department John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide further details.
At the same time, he said that the United States has the tools to “further isolate Russia” if it will support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov, during the conversation with Kerry, once again emphasized the need to create a united front to fight terrorist groups operating on the territory of this country.
They also discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern over Moscow’s increased support for Assad.
Washington said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov said that the country will not fall into international isolation.
The rebels are in favor of overthrowing the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was seized by the Islamic State terrorist organization.
The international coalition led by the United States is exposing ISIS positions to air strikes.
Borodai called the information of the American newspaper slander on Strelkov.
Former Prime Minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic Alexander Boroday denied the information that was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent of "Lenta.ru".
The Washington Post article is great because it’s all over the place.
The former Minister of Defense of the DPR Igor Strelkov, of course, no one tied him up and “leaved” from the territory of the republics of Donbass in a very uplifted mood, without ropes, without three trucks of money, which are attributed to him by different characters.
According to Borodai, the conversation about Strelkov in conversation with a reporter of the American newspaper really went.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," the former head of the DPR government said.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write about the fact that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia “bound”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then it is surprisingly misunderstood words, because I emphasized that Strelkov left himself,” said Borodai.
"This is a slander against me and Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier in the pages of the Washington Post there was an article that quoted the words of Beard that he took Strelkov to the territory of Russia in a forced order.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to tie his partner.
Polish authorities began searching for a train carrying Nazi gold.
Polish woodcutters have begun cutting down trees above the underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, reports Reuters.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to check the validity of rumors about the railway composition with treasures.
Inside the train can be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a train with gold is no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to encircle the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland’s deputy culture minister, Pyotr Zhukovsky, said that local treasure hunters had a “99 percent probability” of finding the train carrying the gold of the Third Reich, which is said to be legendary.
Zhukovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are found, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm appealed to the authorities of the Polish city of Walbrzych with a message that they found a train in a walled tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
Russia’s chief narcologist has proposed banning the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Evgeny Brun noted that before this age "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - acts especially harmful."
So he said in a live broadcast of the radio station “Moscow Says”, commenting on the information that the speaker of the Council Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years of age.
People are growing unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for this.
He is mentally ready for a full-fledged life in society from the age of 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, is finally ripening only by the age of 21," Brun said.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project “Sober Russia” Sultan Khamzaev told “Izvestia” that Matvienko supported the initiative to increase the age limit when selling alcohol and “agreed with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again at the site of the upper house of parliament.”
According to the activist, a working group will soon be established in the Federation Council to develop a draft law under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the law on information protection of children
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor’s office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law “On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development”, the statement was read on September 16.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society in the “Chitai-gorod” store on Red Avenue.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law "On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development."
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the prosecutor’s office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the appeal of the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent of Syb.fm.
This is a serious problem that will stir up society.
He will start to read the Bible, which he has not done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatricians Rio Grande promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a controversial method by which it is going to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves the demonstration of images of babies sucking breasts, painted with images of harmful food.
Breast milk contains various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which babies get all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to high energy needs, pregnant women and mothers are recommended to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study suggests that a single calorie increase is not the only dietary change that mothers need to make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child's immune system has been identified.
A train rammed a school bus near Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on a railway track.
The 23-year-old driver, realizing that she could not move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, there was a collision in front of their eyes.
He was filmed by one of the students.
Due to the emergency situation, panic arose among the students.
Some children started crying and running along the side of the road.
The route is still blocked.
Police said no one was injured except one passenger on the train, who was slightly injured.
Damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a duel with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, held on Friday, ended with the victory of Magali by knockout in the 12th round.
Brown was hospitalized with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life support device.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He has two children.
This is the second death among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Bradon Smith died from injuries received in the ring.
Now AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, but rather, from her point of view, to ban it altogether.
I understand this is unintentional,” said Stephen Parnis, the organization’s vice president.
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be situations when an athlete gets a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads to either death or serious injury.
For this reason, the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together practicing physicians and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against parliamentarians of the Russian Federation.
The speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Sergei Naryshkin called unacceptable the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said this, speaking at the session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar.
We regard this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue,” the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the participants of the OSCE PA to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let’s put morality back into politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us return humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
“Two-facedness never ended in anything good,” he said.
Speaking from the podium of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security objectives.
“First, on resolving the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group,” Naryshkin said.
He also noted that it is necessary to pay tribute to the OSCE.
"This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician said.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until September 18.
I enjoyed the victory for a couple of days.
World Athletics Champion Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergei Shubenkov.
He managed to win the European team championship at his crown distance of 110 meters with barriers, set several records, and most importantly - to become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, taking the third place in the overall standings.
"News" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the outgoing season.
Is the season still not over for you?
Yes, I am going to perform at the World War Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I will think about vacation.
True, I will be preparing now at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a completely different state.
It's easier than walking around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
The passion after the main start of the season has boiled away, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
You can compete in pleasure, in "relax".
Plus, you know, vacation's coming up soon.
Are you tired?
After all, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions ...
Fatigue at the end of the season always accumulates.
It doesn’t matter what you do, whether you win or lose.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant flights, moves - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now, of course, my emotions are on the rise.
Whatever - I'm just happy!
By the time you finish at the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you, journalists, don't let me forget that.
But in general, I believe that a bad athlete who lives the old victories, scrolls through his successful races again and again.
I enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and we need to move on.
Is the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can’t say that there was anything so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at meetings, then at home again.
As usual.
But with the coach set a task: to try to reach a new level, which I was not yet.
Almost all winter time was spent on laying the base.
We ran a bunch of crosses, did exercises for general physical training, which included pulling, squats, and back we pumped.
Then they took up barrier training, they did a lot of engineering.
Have you watched your competitors?
I always try to do this, the good in the age of the Internet with this no problem.
I watched the winter European Championship, and there in the barrier sprint the whole pedestal was occupied by the French!
I also thought: we need to do something, dilute this company.
With every start this season, you’ve added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
All of my last seasons have been about the same pattern.
There's no way I'm running at 13.20 and then at 13.50.
I’m always moving my shape gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was to run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was focused primarily on this result.
But the paradox is that you seem to feel that you are ready for feats, and in competitions to show your readiness is not always possible.
How was it, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I, to be honest, tried to forget that semi-final race (Shubenkov could not get to the final. - "NI") immediately.
It was pretty good, I could really run out of 13 seconds.
And even if he repeated his best result at that time, he would become a bronze medalist of the Games.
But bad luck.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
What's wrong with that?
It was in Daegu.
I really wanted to get to the final, there was such a program-maximum.
And fell off right from the morning, in the pre-runs.
Then I realized that to tear up and go with a broken head means not to run anywhere at all.
Two years later at the World Cup in Moscow already reached the final with the best time.
I remember my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the "gold"!
How is it possible, developing a decent speed, not to lose your head, not to disconnect?
And that's the hardest part.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique, so as not to break down barriers.
I have noticed that when you adjust not to the result, but to the process, it is much easier.
And the most high, when you have the feeling that you are running and everything works out!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the hinterland after the first serious successes seek to move closer to the capital.
Have you never had such thoughts?
It's still better at home.
I don't know where I'm going without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I try to be satisfied with what I have.
C Klevtsov, how long have you been together?
Since I was 12 years old, when I started athletics.
First, I trained with his wife, who worked with children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in length, triple.
Children's multiplayer was - it's when they throw the ball, jump in length from a place ...
At 14, I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
From the first race it was possible to fulfill the standard of the second adult category.
That's what it was.
Has there ever been a fear of barriers?
I immediately managed to negotiate with them.
I have always had to work a lot on technology.
There was so much suffering over one dispersion!
There is no way out of this routine.
The technique must be sharpened constantly - in order to wake me up at night, I would immediately get up and run over the barriers.
Everyone who has seen your race in Beijing claims that it was a very beautiful run.
Oh, thanks.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually review my races, and I couldn't help it.
But efficiency needs to be worked on - there are no limits to perfection.
Are you afraid that a year before the Olympics victory will be a heavy burden on your shoulders?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
If you chose this path, then you must go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, you shouldn't feel any extra weight.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well, I am not naive enough to be surprised by the reaction to the interview in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, do not feed them with bread - give, throw the enemy.
And although I didn't fly the flag, and I said the same thing a million times here, and I didn't directly call anyone a bastard, I was struck by something else.
All my pseudo-friends instantly, in a second, disappeared somewhere.
The pressing I am subjected to is so strong that even I, who have seen the kind of boys, think that people are bleached.
It was as if you were walking, walking, and you were attacked by a crowd and, well, shouted with rods.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, I'm old, guys, afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, and now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so suck it up.
And only jerks can give passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson.
I wish I, the best journalist, had a shameless job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili sharply described the Crimean events:
What was done to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the drunken Khrushchev tried to sign something, in no way fits into the overall picture of human dormitory.
It's like coming to a neighbor and picking up his living space...
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, it started with a call from some bastard from the Kremlin dungeon.
I can guess who it might be...
Kobzon doesn't have much left to live.
I don’t understand, he is the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin’s hands.
Will he lose his apartment?
Well, they tore down his monument.
Of course, people remember him as insulting his little homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seven leads in the ranking despite the attempts of the Ninth to highlight the loss of the leaders in the Today Show
Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson’s outing in Canberra to cover the ramifications of the Liberal Party’s announcement to vacate the leader’s seat failed to raise the rating of Today much.
The morning show of Ninth was broadcast from the capital of the state after the defeat of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Competitor Sunrise, with hosts David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long international broadcast series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distance torture didn’t seem to make much of a difference to Australian TV viewers, with Sunrise’s audience numbering 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to Today’s audience of 339,000.
Today scored slightly higher than its ranking on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to 330,000 for Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers versus 314,000 at Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
Important news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the recently widowed father of a family who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics argued whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without Rebecca Gibney's Rafters star.
The result of last night was a loud yes.
The X Factor Seven remained strong with an audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily overtaking The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For Seven mixed good and bad on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new TV quiz, which was hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuyre (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of Chase Australia attracted 520,000 spectators, and the second half-hour – a staggering 720,000.
Hot Seat raised 620,000.
The fall in the ratings of Chase Australia on the second night will force Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for the Million Dollar Minute, which failed to override McGuire's show.

The three finalists agree that “Bachelor” Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The Secret Revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellowes, Sarah McKay and Snezhana Markoski may have accidentally made it clear which one of them would win in Bachelor.
The woman who will eventually be with Sam Wood in "The Bachelor" is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who reached the final, of course, remain silent about which of them received his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McKay, Snow Marcoski, and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls would have to remain, they may have accidentally given a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood will remain silent until the finale on Thursday.
All three women come in a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, dedication, family values, cheerfulness as the reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, with their answers to the question "If not you, then who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could involuntarily suggest which of them actually won the heart of the "Bachelor".
Jevons-Fellows and Markoski no doubt called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship from day one.
"From the moment I joined the cast, I felt the energy [of Sarah] and the energy of Sam, and I knew they were very good together, and I had no doubt about it throughout the show," Jevons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is a very open person, she’s easy and fun,” Markoski added.
I saw them together, there really is an attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will make a great couple.
McKay herself said that thanks to her home dates last week, she realized that Wood may be “the same person.”
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized that it was definitely not just a game - I believed him with all my heart," she says.
When asked who Voodoo should choose if it wasn’t her, she answered mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can talk about it,” she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snow White and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor show airs on Wednesdays at 7.30 p.m. on the Ten Channel.
Originally published under the title "Sarah is Sam Wood's Best Choice?"
Jarrid Hayne had several options to start his career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle have taken a strong interest in him since he moved to the U.S. – as have many other clubs who sent in enquiries after an impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seemed like a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian rugby league player allowed on the first return of the hinge in a winning game against Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another chance to get the hinge back, and also involved him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of giving a break to the newcomers in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received support from special team coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball on the return of the hinge by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
For such a start of the debut in the NHL, Hayn and his numerous Australian fans clearly did not expect.
He was seen swearing as he left the field after losing the ball, and later he told the hosts of the show "Hamish and Andy" on the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more unsuccessful start for a career in the NFL.
“It happens, you just think about the next game and that’s it,” said Hayne.
Hayne compared his miss to his debut in the Origin series of games in 2007, when throwing the ball in his qualifying zone brought an attempt to Queensland.
In the end, this experience proved to be very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne was photographed with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a photo on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of using weapons at a Siberian airport.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were thwarted.
Clashes between migrants and police took place on the Hungarian border.
Refugees staged protests on the Serbian border near the Hungarian town of Reske, which escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, reports Reuters.
Migrants throw stones at police officers and try to demolish the fence at the border.
Reinforcements have been sent to the site of the clashes, police are responding to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to violate the border.
As reported by Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border by bus towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reported.
The authorities of the country allowed migrants to arrive in Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian Parliament tightened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for the processing of asylum applications.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, so he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within a year.
The Hungarian parliament intends to consider the transfer of the functions of border guarding to the Hungarian armed forces in the near future.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a barbed wire fence 175 km long on the border with Serbia to curb the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian admitted to committing the largest in the history of the United States cyber attack.
Accused of the largest cyberattack in the history of the United States, Russian Vladimir Drinkman admitted to the theft of more than 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During a trial in the federal court of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to conspiring to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke about collusion with three citizens of Russia and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the defendants was estimated at $ 300 million.
“Defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security,” U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison, as well as a fine of one million dollars.
When rendering the verdict, the court will take into account the confession of the Russian and, possibly, shorten his term.
Drinkman's verdict will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the crimes charged against him.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with Russia’s backing of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict and undermining our common goal of fighting extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” the statement said.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to combat the Islamic State group (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad “will never be a reliable member” of the coalition.
During the phone call, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
The White House has threatened Russia with isolation because of its support for the Assad regime.
Earlier, White House spokesman Joshua Earnest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest suggested joining an international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media has often reported the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping the Syrians to learn the technique to use it against Islamists.
Four killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began firing rubber bullets at crowds protesting the country’s proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country’s capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the district police chief, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered at one of the police stations, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that police officers used tear gas and then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such a high mortality rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of fierce protests in southern, flat Nepal, where Madezi people say the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in the west of Nepal, among citizens of the Tahrir people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10.
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which was centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake that claimed the lives of thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted for articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise with 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects, he told the correspondent of "Regional".
Oleg Valeryevich, how did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of audits of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit of local budget spending.
Subsequently, an audit of municipal property was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the document turnover to five days.
Previously, papers on the instances could walk for months.
Measures have been developed to increase the revenue base and optimize expenditures.
In November last year, a visiting meeting of the government was held in Sayansk, where the issues of socio-economic development of the territory were discussed.
There was no design and estimate documentation (PSD) for any object in the city.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of PSD for roads, kindergarten, northern sewerage and water supply.
Roadworks in two areas are already underway.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demographics have not been seen in the city for the last 27 years.
So the issue of securing places in kindergartens today is one of the most urgent.
Since September 1, the kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 seats, has been closed for major repairs.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, kindergarten No. 23 was opened, which is now attended by 200 children.
The repair was made on the terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds were found for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the People's Initiatives program also helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the priority of children aged from one and a half to three years.
We do not have queues for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors interested in the area?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be engaged, first of all, Sayan enterprises, it is they who need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningradsky district is commissioned.
As for construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya, which entered the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing for those wishing to participate in the program very much.
One of the conditions - housing should not be more expensive than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this cost includes finishing "turnkey".
If we manage the set volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayan Pork Complex was built on the territory, which was sold for a price in 2004.
We are working with the prosecutor's office to challenge this deal.
Especially since the land under the object is federally owned.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to regional property is being resolved, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor, ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of the project 1.5 billion rubles.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
Is the Institute of Social Partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have concluded about 140 agreements of social and economic partnership.
Many projects were implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Substantial support is provided by such enterprises as CJSC "Vostok-Centr", Novo-Ziminskaya CHP, LLC "Sayansky broiler", LLC "PK MDF", the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Directly to the Day of the city LLC "Sayan Broiler" gave the city a children's town, the company "Vostok-Center" carried out repairs of the horse yard, where specialists are engaged in children and therapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the city registry office.
Sponsors helped to colorfully celebrate the Day of the City.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of urban collectives and organizations.
The chronicle of the city, a book of Sayan poets, was published.
The first builders and people who made a serious labor contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded anniversary medals.
The patrons also participate in the work of the city charitable foundation.
The first step was the acquisition of instruments for young talented musicians.
For nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles were allocated to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, and to support children from low-income families.
How are personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and teachers in the city.
To solve the personnel issue, it is of great importance to provide housing for specialists.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers received official housing.
We have a program to allocate housing with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
The plan is to redevelop the building, in which eight more apartments for teachers will be built.
Also, teachers and doctors participate in the program "Housing for the Russian family".
In the future - the construction of a house for employees of the budget sphere.
The most important thing is that the city has a working team with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a bill on indexation of social pensions taking into account the increase in prices.
The state Duma introduced a bill providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document - the deputy from "Fair Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Roumyantsev - also proposes to conduct an additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the growth rate of the subsistence minimum exceeds the growth rate of prices for goods and services.
The indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from April 1, taking into account the growth rates of the subsistence minimum pensioner in the Russian Federation for the past year.
The draft law introduced in the lower house provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions taking into account the growth rate of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to February 1, and the second is held on April 1.
The head of the OSCE PA said Mogherini about the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, OSCE PA Speaker Ilkka Kanerva said that sanctions against lawmakers participating in the Assembly’s activities are unacceptable.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulan-Bator Nikolay Kovalev.
According to TASS, in support of Kanerva’s position, signatures of European parliamentarians were collected, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece.
“Already formed a strong enough support,” said Kovalev.
Earlier, he said that the head of the OSCE PA spoke with the intention to collect signatures of deputies, which pointed to the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, noted Kovalev, Kanerva promised to raise this problem to the level of the governing structures of the European Union and "send a relevant petition."
The NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Cape Islands is 60 percent.
A wide front of the low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure area roughly in the middle between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, Miami weather forecasters say.
Google launches campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has launched a doubling campaign to raise $11 million for aid organizations helping flooded European countries fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an uncharacteristic personal approach by announcing a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement from one of the executives, Google employee Rita Massoud, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
“We got on dubious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
The donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations dedicated to helping refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said it will double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount on google.com/refugeerlift reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, driven largely by a four-year civil war in Syria that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Low-obesity diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
The beneficial effect after obesity surgery in people with low obesity who have type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that low-obesity diabetics live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
“The mortality statistics are not immediately apparent,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote about the new study in a column from the JAMA Surgery editor.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of the body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but main studies have been conducted in people with morbid obesity who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal with a value between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass surgery and sleeve gastrectomy — with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people with low obesity.
The average BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year of study participation.
At the same time, the BMI of those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and 28% were partially cured.
In the group receiving medication, for comparison, complete cure from diabetes was observed in only 1%, and partial - only in about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors say.
The researchers also monitored blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the treatment group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But the best glycemic controls, reflected by good levels of A1c hemoglobin, did not reduce the death rate in five years, according to study leader Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the group receiving a sleeve gastrectomy, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in BMI (by 7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was also closer to complete remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.1%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to increased life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who opted for bariatric intervention, the likelihood of dying within 15 years was about 29% lower compared to the group who used more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important here because it argues that such surgery is safe in a group with a low BMI where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient’s BMI falls in the range between 27 and 30.
“I think we’ve waited too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse it.
In Mytishchi, the robbers took out of the house fur coats and 9 million rubles.
In Mytishchi, robbers attacked residents of the Moscow house and stole from them 9 million rubles and three women's fur coats.
This is reported by "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown people entered the house through the open front door, located on Gorky Street, tied the 20-year-old son of the owner of the house and, threatening with both knives, stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was opened under the article "Robbery".
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come in 2018 to watch the World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to obtain the appropriate permit.
According to experts, this is a very alarming sign.
On the eve of the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to come up with how to settle all the guests of the city.
Rosbalt's interlocutors believe that due to the tournament, the cost of renting rental apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for rented housing will have to overpay.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the primacy, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to the requests of the Federal Antimonopoly Service for St. Petersburg.
According to Vadim Vladimirov, head of UFAS, the agency has studied 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antitrust officers.
There are signs that the leadership of three dozen companies deceived citizens by placing a certain number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov said.
The problem is that now literally every number is on the account, none can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city, tourists can count on 30.5 thousand rooms.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 - two- and three-star, 550 - one-star.
According to the first deputy committee for the development of tourism Nana Guichia, at the moment only 23 hotels have passed the classification - so many checks were carried out by companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny by a surprising coincidence is unknown.
That is, there may be more who have passed the classification, but no one knows about it.
"For the last six months, hotels have not been very eager to pass the classification," the director of the North-West branch of the Russian Union of Tourism Industry, Ekaterina Shadskaya, admitted.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets in which the cost of inspections has not been laid down, while the procedure can cost the hotel, depending on the status, from 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more.
Recently, hotel managers have stepped up and started applying for classification, Shadskaya said.
Hotels have until July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but also not get the right to work at the world championship.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed fee will be developed for the hotel room for the time of the tournament.
The formulas on which the cost will be calculated will be published next year.
This is done in order to prevent a rise in prices by 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
It is necessary to have a conscience and not to allow the increase in two or three times, but hotels should be allowed to earn money.
“I think the growth will be up to 50%,” said Gennady Lamshin, president of the Russian Hotel Association.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that the fixation of prices corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I do not know how much this fits within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
“It’s better than an unbridled rise,” he said.
It is unclear what will happen with popular cheap hostels.
State Duma deputies introduced a bill according to which hostels should be banned in residential buildings.
We strongly hope that this law will not be adopted or will not concern St. Petersburg.
“We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved,” Nana Gwachia said.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be ready to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma still approves the bill, about 80% of hostels will close in St. Petersburg, and at the moment there are 1,500 rooms in them.
According to the President of the Federation of restaurateurs and hoteliers of the North-West Leonid Garbar, in St. Petersburg there is a shortage of two- and three-star hotels, which are in demand by football fans, but there is a skew towards hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to the situation when "75 thousand VIPs are sitting in an 80,000-square-foot stadium".
This can be fixed at the expense of mini-hotels.
Their possible ban expert considers "idiocy": "I find it strange that only people can live in apartments, but visitors for some reason can not."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that this is wrong.
But if as a hotel, where guests come for a short period of time, why not?
Mini-hotels run the risk of missing the World Cup due to their recklessness.
Hundreds of small hotels simply do not have time to pass the classification, and the hole is digging itself.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordered.
"There are not many companies that can carry out this procedure, so they will refuse less paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that travel," Gennady Lamshin noted, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the rates of passed inspections are at the moment much higher than those of St. Petersburg.
The reason for the delay in St. Petersburg is related to constant changes in the government’s tourist block, which does not contribute to the coordinated work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, it is likely that you will have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
Following the example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, the river fleet can be mobilized into the city, that is, the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will arrive prepared in vans, in which you can spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that they are empty afterwards," Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Also very popular during the football championship will use rented housing.
Most likely, a reserve of rental apartments will be created in the city.
Rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
"From the obvious - the first to leave the housing near the stadium," - said rental specialist Agency for Development and Real Estate Research Larisa Bragina.
Moreover, the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport junctions on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Do not forget about the human qualities of the city.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city, in which people not only suggest the way, but can also conduct a mini-tour.
There are also complications.
In 1970, my dad met a family from Murmansk in the yard - a father, a mother and two children.
They found nowhere to sleep: it was difficult to sleep in hotels at that time, it was hard to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," the interlocutor recalled.
However, he added that now there is no such feature in the residents of the city - to call home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "merged" the Amur region.
With admiration today watched the clown Zhirinovsky in the State Duma.
He did things like that when our generation was just learning to trade newspapers, and he is still in great shape.
The theme of the speech, it seems, is "the protest of the LDPR against the results of the elections in the Amur region".
The protocols do not shake - because there is nothing; other protocols, except those signed by the election commissions, the LDPR, apparently, does not have.
Here he picks up the second-placed Ivan Abramov and shouts something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"
And then out of nowhere he attacks Rodnina, and then, after a quarrel already with the chairman, withdraws the faction from the conference room, shouting literally "You are all with your fronts crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
In fact, Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly drained the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is Zhirinovsky’s latest “Scumbags!”-style hoax, not a political party’s protest against the results of specific elections.
And the faction has formally failed, and the election, according to the party website and Facebook of Ivan Abramov, is not recognized, but the leader is clearly getting off the topic.
He leaves the dead on the Cupid to bury their dead themselves, and he preaches the gospel against "United Russia" as a whole and an innocent relative.
An elegant solution so as not to lose your face, and not to go into a real, not showy scandal.
Another thing is that now Abramov himself is in a strange situation.
Apart from the screams from the authorities, he did not wait for anything, there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
It is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for a narrow circle, it became a formal occasion for insulting the esteemed champion, and, what is even cooler, rude attacks against the EP and the ONF.
And then, of course, he has to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, the politician number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 for the only regional single-mandate district, he can turn into a pariah, who successfully used his own party leadership and super-irritator for the same ONF and party leadership of another.
Certainly - there would be no Zhirinovsky, he should have been invented and respectfully observed.
Trump is still growing and growing before him.
There was news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next film festival.
The bathroom fell out of nowhere.
Abramov’s theme was buried under him.
It's beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama’s Center for Compassion for Ethics Studies in Oxford, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the present circumstances, the interests of humanity should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that while this is admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
“Caring for thousands of refugees is fine, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the U.S. tough reaction launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to this problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it had unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children swallowing hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010, in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed a high-alcohol hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Center, cases of children under 12 swallowing hand sanitizer fluids reported to toxicology centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are more likely to come into contact with these substances, and unfortunately a certain percentage of them are sent to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink the disinfectant on purpose, and some do it to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
Youtube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquid as a cheap drink.
The teenagers were reportedly mixing the disinfectant with an alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the pleasant smells of disinfectant liquid.
"The child doesn't think it's going to hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are flavored.
There are hand sanitizers with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s a high-concentration alcohol,” said Dr. Steven Thornton, chief physician of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn’t leave a glass of whiskey behind, but people keep these hand sanitizers in sight, and if children get to them, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a strawberry-flavored hand sanitizer at school in the amount of about four sprays, was sent to an ambulance for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice that of an adult who is legally considered intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija was confused by words and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance.
Doctors watched her through the night in a separate children's clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain injury, as the alcohol caused her to fall and hit her head, Ritchie said.
“It was very scary,” Ortoria Scott, Naigi’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectant napkins, in addition to removing hand disinfectant liquids from children’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids have been linked to death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, and not ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three four-year-old students in northern New York conspired to poison their “disgusting” teacher by “distributing antibacterial substances in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher has a severe allergy to hand sanitizers, and she forbade keeping them in her classroom.
Police believe the failed plan was “empty talk” and address disciplinary issues to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya a cast iron owl is saddened.
The kids who come for the books are trying to feed her candy.
He has been attending this library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twenties of the last century held loud readings here, staged performances based on the poems of Mayakovsky, held literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalinist" wrote in 1939, every day "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even once sent her childhood photo to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnauls asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna objected to the library being given her name, she wrote that no, she did not object.
The letters have long dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose harsh profile adorns the bas-relief on the library building.
During the years of perestroika, different people often called, resentful: why is the children's library not renamed?
Let there be a library named after some good children's writer, without political coloring!
The staff of the library sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a yellow brick path.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is a favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager in a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and from all the other managers differed only in her love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet that said, "I need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother has cancer".
Olya made illustrations, and thought that life could end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it if you do not create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books of writers around the world and writes fairy tales herself.
It is traditionally believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some kind of virtual space.
But we have children who read, and their parents understand the importance of reading, says the director of the library, Tatyana Kushvid.
In recent years, we even have such a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and it will live - the children are coming here!
I think my interest in reading is back.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained glass with an updated photo exposition.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers who go to the library with the whole family: mom, dad and children are posted.
In the library, they are glad that dads are coming with the children more and more often.
If at the age of two a child read all Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs more complicated books.
But now there is a law that prohibits an eight-year-old prodigy from issuing books from the 12+ category.
To get such a book, the child must bring his parents with him - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them a kind of family club.
The library has treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of epics with captives and eras, Korolenko's stories in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", the cover of "Murzilki" for 1936.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space of the "temple of the book", we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school," explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play and paint together.
We made a play area for kids - the child comes just to play, and the hand still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they are resting on their feet, they do not want to leave.
Often moms come with strollers - and we are glad that they put the library in the first place among all the other places where you need to come with children.
Tatyana Kushvid says: modern children, just like we once, love classical children's literature:
“Publishing is evolving now, and much attention is paid to authors who are the link between generations.”
And if we talk about young children, it is important for them that there is some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to leave their heroes.
The library constantly produces booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children's literature, which books are worth paying attention to and why.
Booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is still not for them.
It is forbidden to take books outside the reading room for adults.
This magical privilege is only for children.
In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, in the bookstore.
Steps will creak under your steps - this is a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood, you meet like an old comrade: hi, it's good that we do not change.
Ellie still happily walks along the road paved with yellow bricks, lazy Tolya Ryzhykov steals magic matches, and Malchich-Kybalchich never told the damned bourgeois of the Military Secret - such a hard word he has.
Such books are like passwords, by them you can recognize yours anywhere.
There are also real book rarities in the repository - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of epics with epics and eras.
Or to tell Korolenko in the famous appendix to Niva magazine.
Or "Murzilki" lining for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, painted them in tea color.
These books are no longer available to readers.
These are the fragments of our future collection, I always dream - to retire and do rare children's books.
But the children will not do it, so to speak: the colors in the old books are not very bright, and the topics ... you open the first page, and there is Lenin, the Party, the Komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all write this "Pioneer Truth"?
But it was still interesting," Galina Ilyasova, the head of the bookstore, told The Russian Planet.
The pages of "Murzilka" have darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna manages the bookstore all her life.
She knows the color of Buratino’s hat, which school year Harry Potter became Gryffindor’s team captain at the Quidditch Championship, in which situations Carlson uses a silencer for the engine, and who Alice Selezneva’s father works for.
Librarians are paid little for their work, and anyone who can live without these books quickly finds a different profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, servants of the cult of the book.
They can also be recognized by a smile - it is believed that this is a professional feature of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, he is a professional.
I love children's books in general: as a librarian, I like them to be, to stand smoothly and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love to read them, - says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fantasy.
I read contemporary Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think in my childhood everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of everything that happened to me at the time.
And because I loved them so much, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope there will always be books, despite the readers.
And I am glad when our former readers bring children, or even grandchildren...
Rumours: There is no disagreement in Celtic
Griffiths refuted the Celtic disagreement after Dale admitted that Hopes was in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
The Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim to Nailson, and Warburton fears signing contracts in January that could break the team's unity.
The Dons have increased their advantage over Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a slight advantage over Hamilton in Pitthead, which allowed the Dons to break away from Celtic by five points.
Griffiths denies talk of disagreements
This sparked rumours of disagreements at Celtic, which were thwarted by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates were not suffering any heightened criticism as he prepared for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
“I don’t think we’re feeling the tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored, because the Scots are not in the fight for the title - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team member Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because he is not competing for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an Ajax representative, said: "In Holland, the most attractive moments of the Celtic games are no longer shown, but why?"
That's because there are no Rangers.
People aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the "Old Company."
They’re talking about both teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
There’s a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it’s not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
“I’m going to change everything,” Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic are in trouble, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
The loss to Malmö and, as a result, the withdrawal from the Champions League was soon followed by the loss of 10 players of Aberdeen, who now, having broken off by five points, occupies the top line of the table.
However, Dale said, "Selitka has had bad periods before, and we'll be out again."
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that it’s very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what’s going on.
Neither do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need the support of Celtic, because it makes the players much better.
Staying together is so important right now.
Warburton with distrust waiting for January transfers
Despite opinions that emerged just a couple of weeks ago suggesting he has identified some of the goals of the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warberton is suspicious of the January campaign, arguing that he does not want to destroy the team’s unity.
The former Brentford striker said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season for them to adapt, which you’ve seen in our own group this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Michu, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career
Swansea striker Michu, linked to Celtic during the transfer window, hinted he could leave football after his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old player suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to oppose the SFA over the statements of Neilson
The Harts led 2–1 when they removed Paterson and lost 3–2, but the defender's red card was later revoked; it was Colum's third red card to be revoked in eight months.
Neilson said, “I didn’t question ethics, I didn’t comment on the game.”
Griffiths swore to avoid Tyncastle
The stubborn Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with insulting words about ex-Harts player Rudy Skatzel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh derby at Tinkasla in March 2014.
“It was a derby and it was hot,” he said, adding: “I can say with confidence that I wasn’t going back to Tinkasle if he wasn’t playing for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannadis board confident in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly argues that the board of directors of Dundee United is still confident that the team of managers will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the guys to come out again,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy that "ugly" won against "Hamilton"
Derek McInness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against the Hamilton Assis to achieve a seventh consecutive league victory, placing them five points above Celtic, at the top of the standings, thanks to a penalty shootout by Adam Rooney in the first half.
McInness said, “There’s not a team here that wins anything – a cup or a league championship – that doesn’t win meetings that way.”
Unemployment rate among Scots does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was above the UK level of 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people in three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell in the quarter to 74.0%, above the average figure of 73.5% in the United Kingdom.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with employment growth and reduced unemployment.
Why I Witnessed the Execution in Oklahoma
Today, avoiding legal intervention at a late stage, I will watch a man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting on the death row gallery at Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The first time this request was made was back in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and because they often want more than places, the results of the grim lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I will be sitting with Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and we have developed our own relationship after a few months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'm gonna have to try and remember all the details.
One Oklahoma reporter accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better" herself, but still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international newspaper journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that glasnost will help the movement for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts that I have recorded.
I'm not going to go into details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death penalty was insufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this point of view, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't say I'm going to be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to turn to.
You'll learn from me what it's like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
A man harassed by the police was persuaded to climb out of the Canning River
A police officer from the town of Canning Vale managed to persuade a man to climb out of the Canning River, and himself remained dry.
A resident of Perth intended to leave the police, but failed, stuck in dirty water in shallow water a few meters from the police officer, trying to "softly persuade him to go ashore".
Cunning Vale police were summoned on Tuesday for illegal entry into someone else’s territory in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by throwing himself into Canning.
But he didn’t go far.
“He was standing in the water and saying, ‘I’m not going out, come on, grab me,’” Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavetz didn't really want to wet the uniform, so he used a safer technique - "negotiating with a good cop."
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” said Sergeant Castledine.
Soccer champion Ben Casins is remembered for this.
In 2006, Cuzzins moved to the cuvette to avoid meeting a police patrol to check for alcohol, and attempted to swim over Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but prompted the locals to invent a joking "biathlon of Ben Casins."
Peter Moody accuses stewards of attempted espionage and threatens to withdraw from equestrian sport
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of trying to infiltrate his stable last year and threatened to leave the equestrian sport immediately.
He was targeted by stewards and employees of the ethics department of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of organizing a campaign against him personally, and the withdrawal of Lady Tatai from the start for violating the rules of drug use on the day of the start, on Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort to participate in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of Lidari's test for cobalt, which he cannot explain.
He had been holding his tongue about suspected espionage for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like a green grape.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I put up with it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so out of hand that you can’t hold back,” Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to endure the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm gonna sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head high and I want my owners to know that I am doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think it’s not, then I’ll have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody had previously said sensationally during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I'll name if asked and offered him a job in my stable to share information about what I'm doing in my stable," Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all undoubtedly file applications, as they have failed to catch me.
Robert Rawlston, the former chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the current executive director of RVL, knew it all along and now know it.
Shouldn't that make me think the case is getting personal?
Shouldn’t RVL have the courage to hold people accountable for what’s going on in this business, other than the coaches?
Am I bad for this job?
Am I bad for this job?
Maybe people out there think that's true.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now might make them think about it.
But now I've reached a point where I don't care, and that saddens me.
It makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and hold them accountable for the decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach’s annoyance only grew during the lengthy investigation into the cobalt and Lidary case, and the last removal of the horse from the start forced him to declare that he could “throw his license on the table”.
Moody, best known for preparing the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medical preparations on the day of the competition "ridiculous" after a clay compress was applied to the horse's legs, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the race rules.
“I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, just like she did.
She was with him the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of drugs on the day of the competition for the use of compress, which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that we need rules, but it’s gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who crashed and fled from the scene of the incident in Cobra, arrested
Police arrested a man who over the weekend hit a motorcyclist in Cobra and fled the scene.
A motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with abandoning the scene, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
“Melbourne Storm” coach Craig Bellamy refutes accusations of rivals in the use of hard power techniques
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of his team's intercepting the ball "imposing the agenda" on the part of the two NRL championship favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during the Storm's sudden victory in the final of the qualifying game in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear allusion to Storm after his team won the qualifying tournament final at the Northern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game "typical" for the rugby league and said that two of the Queensland team were not "too successful" in the rugby league.
Bellamy defended the interception of the ball by his team and stated that they were simply focused on "contacting" intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was reassured by the criticism of his team from the two leading coaches, as it means that they are worried about a possible defeat from the "Storm".
“It keeps coming up – I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talk about tough moves when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said.
I can assure you that we haven’t changed anything in our defense systems or techniques for a whole year, just in the last six weeks we have paid special attention to the contacts when intercepting the ball, and this was a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and he’s clearly training a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, and it’s been a bit of a shock for him.
Funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett’s idea of “impressive football” by reminding his teacher that the St. George-Illawarra Dragons had won the championship in 2010 by showing “boring” football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was.”
I remember in 2010 St. George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It’s the kind of football you want to play when you have players like that.
He made that remark in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play football in his style – not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play that way.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things, because they are a little concerned about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game of Storm and the Roosters was a competition with more points than the game of the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, this is impressive football?
Or consider impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
This is routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
Storm will have a weekend off at the end of this week, as they won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Crownla Sharks next Saturday night at the preliminary finals at AAMI Park, and tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Accused of possession of drugs Serb released on bail of 200 thousand dollars
A man facing life imprisonment for trying to steal 40kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilos of drugs on a Solay yacht sailing from South America via Vanuatu and mooring in Kumera in August.
Maksimovich and his accomplices were seen all morning at the pier, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of the drug in a Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maksimovich faces life imprisonment for attempting to misappropriate drugs in an amount sufficient for sale, Maksimovich's lawyer argues that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the whole batch, and that the man could have been in the cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maksimovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovich's mother and stepfather were offered a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
"It is clear from the testimony of both that the $200,000 bail is too much of a financial burden for them," Flanagan said.
But this measure alone is not enough as a guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimovi<0xC4><0x87> was allowed to bail on condition that he surrendered both his Australian and Serbian passports, would be reported to the police daily and would observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: "I am proud of Greece, which fought to the last seconds."
The head coach of the national team of Greece Fotis Katsikaris paid tribute to his team after the match 1/4 final Eurobasket-2015 against Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by some mistakes.
It was a big game," Katsikaris told AFP.
We were preparing for a great game performed by the Spaniards.
They tried to work in defense, but mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought to the last second.
Joel Freeland: "In CSKA I will be entrusted with the functions of Kaun."
CSKA rookie Joel Freeland said that he does not believe in the curse of the army.
He also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itoudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, - quotes R-Sport Freeland. - In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in defensive constructions and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think that I can deal with this.
Yes, I will need some time to rebuild to the center position, after all, in the NBA I played more forward.
Now it will be necessary to face more of the big centers of the opponent, but I have already done this before, so I think I will cope now.
The last time they won the Euroleague was in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the Final Four six times, but each time they could not show their best basketball.
There is a feeling that the team has been squandered.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it is difficult, I understand the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, then we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the evil eye, I am not a superstitious person and I do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don’t have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: “For me, the match against Roma will be special.
The head coach of Barcelona Luis Enrique did not hide that he returned to Rome for the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with Roma with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the face-to-face fight of his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique trained the "wolves" in the season-2011/12, but failed to prove himself from the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later, during which I gained some experience. – quotes the official website of UEFA Luis Enrique. –
I have very warm memories of Rome.
It’s going to be a special game for me, but it’s not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a victory.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I expect from Roma the game she played in Serie A against Juventus.
It’s a strong team that knows how to push and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: Krasnodar has different options for attacking actions.
Acting head coach of "Ural" Vadim Skripchenko in the run-up to the match of the 9th round of the Premier League with "Krasnodar" noted the variety of attacking schemes of the opponent's team.
According to the mentor, "bulls" have in their arsenal several models of the game in the attack.
The fight will take place on September 21 and will begin at 16.30 Moscow time.

Stephen Hogg Uses Girl's Phone to Get Pedophiles to Send Photos
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to beg for images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, registered with an online messaging service, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She checked it out and found shocking photos, after which she immediately drew the attention of her mother.
The police arrived and saw five images, after which they examined the computers found at this address and found “corresponding” searches in the search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it because it could "attract pedophiles" and then he would have "pretended to be a policeman to scare them."
Commissioner Aileen Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff's Court: "He claimed it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had made computer searches, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman to scare off pedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with an unknown person who had sent him pictures and that he had asked for more photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them in.
He said he had problems with his head when he was drinking, and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the photos on her phone, she called her mother, trembling and crying.
She saw the obscene images on the phone, and then a face-to-face bet was made with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the defendant used a computer and a PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to taking obscene pictures of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defendant’s lawyer, Gregor Sim, petitioned not to include Hogg in the list of sexual offenders, as it could be proved that there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the sentence until October, pending receipt of reports from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was taken into custody before hearings on other remaining cases.
He was listed as having committed sexual offences before the date of sentencing.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe Speaks Wrong in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell from the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video with the scene of the fall instantly spread on social networks.
The opening of the parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary opposition members that they had received anonymous threats warning them against booing Mugabe during the address.
A month ago, they whistled at the president during his address to the nation in parliament; that is what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Member of Parliament for the Movement for Democratic Change Innocent Goneze said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe’s speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled 'Death'," he told reporters at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned prominent members of parliament that immunity ends in the parliament building, and as soon as they leave, parliamentary immunity does not apply.
A member of parliament said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost reduction program.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating computer and printer manufacturing from the faster-growing hardware and service sectors.
The deductions as a result of the projected job cuts will amount to approximately $2.7 billion starting from the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
“Such a restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, Chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, which will lead the organization after the division.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently is, and the portfolio of business areas will be wider and deeper, helping the company transition to a new business style,” Whitman said in a statement.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will “focus on delivering previously unattainable comprehensive technology solutions” to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is how the company was formed in the 1930s by Stanford graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed the "birthplace of Silicon Valley".
Hewlett Packard is undergoing a major reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest PC maker and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest development in the sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates should support injured Jack Wilshere before playing against Dinamo Zagreb
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that it is only September, and that on the condition that Wilshire's recovery goes according to plan, nothing will prevent him from returning to the game by Christmas.
With the most favorable developments, Wilshire will definitely miss at least the next four games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The saddest thing about this recent issue is that Wilshere confidently ended the previous season with a single ankle injury and was about to return to his usual aggressive style of play during pre-season preparation.
Wenger: "This injury does not threaten his career."
It's just not a completely healed bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
It has nothing to do with the ankles or injuries he's had before.
These may be related things from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, there is an associated risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has 23 different injuries that have happened to him in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he has played only 65 of Arsenal’s 157 league games in the past five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for Arsenal more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs with the most missed due to injury days.
Wenger admits the possibility of getting stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you get back into service after an injury, you're vulnerable for a while - during that time you need to recover and gain a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to make it.
I hope he recovers physically, I am sure of that, as well as that his career will be what he deserves.
Arsenal will start the Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match against Dinamo Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with games against Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the squad.
Hector Belierin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Mathieu Debussy and Arteta will play in the starting line-up.
Wenger may also include Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
“I try to keep the balance and give a little respite to those players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is the absolute favorite in Group F, the stadium Maksimir in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
“Dynamo have not lost any of the 41 matches since they managed to spend last season as the Invincible.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake of magnitude 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal has learned the lesson learned last season when the team lost a Champions League game against Monaco, and remains with little hope of leading the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
“It’s an incredible drive,” Wenger said.
Arsenal has never done this before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I’m a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The lack of such stories is striking, especially considering how desperate the need for men to be candid has become, now more than ever, with the suicide rate among young men at its highest in 15 years.
In 2013, it became the single largest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and it happens to men three times more often than it does to women.
In an effort to address the issue, the Campaign Against Unhappy Living has declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to take on this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a sufficiently large number of friends “in a normal mood,” the chances of healing double.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chance of developing mental disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all it needs to be.
In an age where communication is driven by social media, where style is preferred to content, quick response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong, fun-loving, and successful, even when in reality loneliness reigns.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship, which affects our mental health more strongly.
And, as one billionaire video game maker recently noted, money really can’t buy more happiness.
The advantage of Friends is that they attract attention to this.
Each of the characters was defined not through their work, but rather through a personality that manifested itself in communication with friends.
Joey’s humor and Chandler’s constant hugs, moments watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross sighing for Rachel – all come from the realization that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a full examination of their feelings.
As a Samaritans employee told me, “My role as a listener for people who are depressed and suicidal underscores how even the smallest interaction of friends can benefit.”
Often, those men who turn to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching of “live with it” is strong, as is the feeling that candid conversation about problems can be perceived as weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to suggest longer-lasting coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the imperceptible moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of a stranger talking on the phone helps people in moments of despair, while long-term support comes from a close circle of family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the scenery has been completely restored for the holiday, why not take your friends out for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see a single person at Starbucks, smile and say “Hello.”
It is impossible to guess in advance what benefits a friendship can bring.
The Friends series is shown on Comedy Central from beginning to end, all 236 episodes, by tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal by helping PSG defeat Malmö
<0xC3><0x81>ngel di Maria, along with Blaise Mathuidi and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the goals scored in the goal of Malmö.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal, which allowed PSG to easily bypass Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League game with a very convenient 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after starting his first Champions League game as a PSG player to set the direction for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk Shakhtar in Group A, Paris had to make a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, as they aimed not at qualifying for the playoffs, but at the continuation of a series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the field in a game against a team from his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, to give the opponents problems and to play well in defense is a good start, even if there are still moments that we will need to finish during the season," Blanc said.
That's promising.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I regret that we did not score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury in one of the substitutes in the Paris team, which brought her a draw 2:2 in a game against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was pushed to the back by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was noted as a player capable of taking PSG to a new level in Europe after he was bought out from Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran for a pass from Marco Verratti behind Malmö defense and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Willand to Dahland.
However, if someone then expected from PSG an easy and big victory, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who defeated the Celtics in the playoffs to get to this stage, having nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of Nikola <0xC4><0x90>ur<0xC4><0x91>i<0xC4><0x87>’s shot, in which the ball flew past Kevin Trapp’s far rod of goal in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
PSG, on the other hand, sometimes failed himself with unsuccessful passes and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half failed to make at least five attempts, and then failed to process the ball scored by Kavani immediately after the resumption of the game.
However, he proved to be much more skilled in accurate passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, having received which, Di Maria sent the ball with a twisted blow, which passed the bar by Wieland in the 52 minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic tampered with the ball sent to the center of the field from the left by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about returning to the game, and only Wieland's interception of the ball from a close distance prevented David Luis from increasing the final score before Esekiel Lavessi, who was replaced, was scored at the very end of the match.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, and this is not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory to "Money"!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glencore Makes $2.5 Billion in Share Sales
Switzerland-based mining and trading giant Glencore, hit by falling commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion in share sales as part of its grand debt-reduction plan.
The London-listed Glencore company said it had sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is struggling to cope with a collapse in commodity prices as China’s economic downturn worsens demand and creates chaos in global markets.
Thanks to the release of new shares at a discounted price, Glencore's stock price on the London Stock Exchange took off in the early morning trading on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77% to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which was trading 0.69% higher at the opening.
Glencore last week launched a $2.5 billion share sale as part of extensive plans to cut its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company was selling new shares at 125 cents apiece, with a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
It placed 1.3 billion new shares, representing 9.99 percent of the company’s share capital.
Fears of a continued downturn in the Chinese economy have reduced the cost of iron ore by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials have fallen in price by 20-40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House confirmed in an official statement on Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an official visit to the United States later this month.
The visit -- Xi's first visit to Washington -- will take place on September 25 and will be a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing in November last year, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi Jinping with his wife Peng Liyuan at a government dinner on the evening of the same day after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
"The visit of President Xi Jinping will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and will also allow the presidents of the United States and China to constructively address controversial topics," the statement said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with executives from several leading U.S. tech companies on his way to Washington, D.C., and then travel to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about alleged cyber espionage by China and China’s growing vehementness over the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by the governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev at a meeting of the presidium of the regional government.
Some of them related to the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, funds were allocated for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools of the Nizhnetavdinsky district, for the overhaul of the regional hospital in the Kazan district.
According to the accompanying documents, the money will go to the completion of the overhaul of the second floor of the therapeutic department.

The second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On September 17-18, the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, which will be attended by a Tyumen delegation headed by the governor.
Vladimir Shuglia, Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen, who was a member of the official delegation, tells about the upcoming event in Sochi and the intermediate results of cooperation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the tasks of the Sochi Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is built on the fruitful cooperation of the regions - important links of relations between the two states.
It is planned that the plenary session will be attended by President of Russia Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
Within the framework of the plenary and sectional sessions, we will talk about the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory and legal support and programs of the Union State.
The governor of the Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I think that this indicates a successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also come to the forum.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will be held, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
The first such meeting was held in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, participated in its work.
At the same time, a very important cooperation agreement was signed between the Tyumen and Minsk regions.
The importance of our developments is also shown by the fact that a meeting of the permanent seminar at the parliamentary assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
In addition, the delegation of the Tyumen agro-industrial complex visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in the training of personnel for agriculture, identify additional points of contact and organize new investment projects in the field of agro-industrial complex.
Recently, you met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of the Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakushev, it was about cooperation between the region and the Republic of Belarus in today’s difficult conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be touched on - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the end user.
Problems in the work of the Tyumen trading house "Belshina" and options for preventing losses were discussed.
The issues are important, as investment projects should work clearly and bring profit to the region.
Further deliveries of passenger and cargo equipment of OJSC "MAZ", the development of the service center of OJSC "MAZ", which was created in Tyumen on the basis of OJSC "TPATP", were discussed.
The talks also touched on preparations for the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of this year.
Another topic of the conversation was the completion of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation of the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promises to reach a new level.
These issues also concerned the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of the administration of the city of Tyumen, Alexander Moore, we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already “breathing incense”, so a new batch of cars from Belarus is needed, which will work on gas, environmentally friendly fuel.
Another aspect: Tyumen Elevator Plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products of Mogilevliftmash, receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs for the installation of new elevators in the regional center.
I will add that within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Kokorin, during which the question of increasing the trade turnover and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment in the Zaural region was discussed.
A meeting with the Governor of Omsk is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a training ground for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Consul General.
In general, such meetings are significant and good in that they allow you to directly and quickly solve many problems, removing their acuteness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current conditions, it is extremely important not to destroy the ambush, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people working in filmmaking
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that ethnic composition should not be taken into account.
During Sunday's HBO show, Project Greenlight interrupted Brown as she tried to emphasize the need for alternative perspectives on the main black character in the script chosen for the project.
“Diversity is appropriate when you’re casting for the movie itself, not the show,” Damon insisted.
Stunned Brown, not believing her ears, insultedly exclaimed "Wow! Wow. Well-well" all the time, while the actor from "The Martian" gave comments live.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers.
"I'd like participants -- no matter who the director is -- to think about what interpretation of Harmony they're going to take," Brown said at the start of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white pimp.
The film's producer, Dear White People, advocated that the film be directed by Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon was strongly opposed, saying that "in the end we may not get what we want".
After this discussion was shown on television, social media blew up with disapproving comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angrily commented on the video: "Explaining the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black person in the room is SO WHITE that it hurts."
Twitter has more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "likes".
Damon’s statements appear just when competent coverage of the racial topic in the media is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colored population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the contenders in the nomination "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and the lives of blacks, albums still matter.
More recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether this group will be considered as a hate group.
“Black Lives Matter is a love band,” the group said in a statement.
It has recently been announced that Damon has been included in the list of show business figures, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion
Professional climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero on Monday evening became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior", taking home the prize of 1 million dollars.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants have managed to pass all the stages of the track with obstacles.
In the season finale, two participants - Caldiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final challenge involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first athlete to complete the task, becoming the first athlete in the history of the "American Ninja Warrior" to go through the exhausting stage 4, but Caldiero coped with the task by as much as three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After winning, Caldiero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview to E!News.
“It’s unbelievable to think about it, because I’ve never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year,” Isaac told reporters at E!.
And all of a sudden... I never imagined what it would be like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Britten, who first walked the track, won’t receive any cash prizes.
According to the rules, the fastest participant receives the money.
“If there is more than one finisher, the fastest one gets the prize,” Wid said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life-changing, it still receives tremendous satisfaction.
I don't think he feels any resentment about it.
He's happy with what he's done.
He received tons of enthusiastic feedback from fans.
He is a wonderful man and a family man.
He is a hero to his wife and children.
Jeff told me, “If I’m going to lose someone, I’m glad it’s Isaac.”
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
"America Ninja Warrior" will return with an eighth season, which will begin shooting in the spring of 2016.
The Kid Tigers are quietly bypassing the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers now occupy the last place in the American League’s central division.
Claiming only to be a nuisance, the Tigers won with brilliance Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with a score of 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins missed the chance to reduce by half the game behind the Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs by the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which eluded them for much of the second half of the season.
“All winnings are fun, no matter how they’re made,” Tigers manager Brad Osmus said.
Pitcher "Tiggers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution in support of the attacks, resulting in Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then added another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three shots.
This was only his third high-quality start in nine exits.
“I just want to finish the year with good performance,” Simon said.
The pitchers on the swap fail to drop in every game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
Appointed rebounding Tigers Victor Martinez managed to repel three strikes and achieved two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strikes since four strikes in a game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with the bat," Osmus said.
He performed well (as a batter), noticeably better in bat work and retained this quality for the game.
Having scored three shots in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to return to the game.
Central receiver Byron Buxton opened the inning with a double on the left line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks made a bow and took the first base, and second baseman Brian Dozier received a strike-out in a swing from Simon before left-handed Blaine Hardy took his place.
Hardy bypassed Moer, the only player in the way, before the newly appointed striker Miguel Sano, who knocked out a two-track "single" to the left of right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of runners out and comparing wound on the second base VerHagen managed to lead the third baseman Trevor Pluff to a rebound in a double play.
It was the 27th time for a top league player this season that Pluff knocked the ball out on a double play.
After Detroit added insured wounds in the first half of the ninth inning, Moyer earned RBI a "double" in the space between the outfielders against the closing pitcher "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the score became 5-4.
However, the right-handed player knocked out Sano after three strikes and received his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily inactive Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three shots in the first two innings against the well-deserved pitcher, who was on the list of injured before the game, missing more than a month due to inflammation of the lower back.
“It’s definitely not the start I’d like,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed, I started to feel more comfortable and therefore able to do some pretty good shots in the third inning.”
After the first batter reached the first base, Hughes threw the single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Wok at two outs of rightfielder J.D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first shot in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series "0 for 21" with the runners in a productive position.
Third-base player Nick Castellanos then made a "single", bringing another wound, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to approach the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning, receiving a one-out "double" from catcher James McCann and a two-out "single" of the center knockout Anthony House, and which became 3-0.
“It was a huge hit,” Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but he got right to the right point.
Hughes, whose shots were considered, threw in an unsuccessful third inning, after which he was replaced by the right-handed relayer A. J. Ahter.
Hughes counted three shots on six hits and a wok with four strike-outs.
NOTES: Pitcher-right Tigers Anibal Sánchez is out of the team due to a stretch of his right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed shoulder surgery on Sanchez back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured since mid-August, is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and go against the Twins.
Norris, who has left the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for David Price’s left-handed pitcher on July 30, has 1 win and 1 loss.
He has not participated in the games since August 20 due to stretching of the oblique muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will be played by right-handed pitcher Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original Kadyrov’s complaint on the book “Prayer to God” was sent to the Yuzhno-Sakhalin court.
In the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk city court received the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision on the recognition of "extremist material" book "Prayer to God: its meaning and place in Islam", reports "Interfax" with reference to the chairman of the city court Alexander Chukhray.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the trial participants.
Chukhrai refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such nonsense themselves," he said.
On September 11, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
The Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Prosecutor’s Office received an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor’s office believes that they asked the court to recognize as extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, and not the verses of the Qur’an.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision," Chukhrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was made on August 12, 2015.
The Qur’an says, “We worship you and ask you for help, so do not call on anyone besides Allah.”
Kadyrov called those who made the decision on the book "stains and provocateurs".
The deputies of the State Duma he called on the legislature to prohibit judicial decisions concerning the texts of the sacred scriptures.
“I firmly believe that the State Duma should pass a law, according to which it is forbidden to make judicial decisions directly concerning the texts of the Qur’an and other Divine Scriptures,” Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook to remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that give a negative assessment of migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
To combat manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, the leadership of Facebook intends to jointly with the German Ministry of Justice.
On the eve of the head of the department Heiko Maas said that currently the Ministry of justice together with experts of the social network is engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to monitor and remove incorrect comments towards migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications stating the reason for the deletion of their record.
Organizations whose specialists are engaged in collecting complaints about offensive posts from users of the social network should also contribute to the prompt blocking of illegal content.
Facebook will provide them with the financial support they need.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements against migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the Ministry of justice of Germany was made after the German segment of Facebook sharply increased xenophobic sentiment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migrant crisis, which engulfed the countries of the European Union some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all the points intended for the placement of refugees are already overcrowded.
On the eve of the country's authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants on the territory of the former concentration camp Buchenwald.
Forcibly displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
In Moscow cemeteries there will be zones for relaxation.
In the near future, several cemeteries in the capital are equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be Butovo, Domodedovo, and Shcherbino cemetery.
The first zone for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troekurovsky cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar areas will appear in other areas of the city.
This portal m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, who holds the position of head of the State budget institution "Ritual".
Zones for relaxation will be small landscaped areas resembling parks.
According to experts, in such "corners" visitors to the cemeteries will be able to relax, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in the Domodedovo, Butovo and Shcherbino cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the Ritual State Administration, if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, builders will try to preserve the existing forests as much as possible.
The green spaces will serve as a hedge that will divide the rest areas and areas allocated directly for burial.
Experts of the Ritual State Administration also announced their intention to make a proposal to abandon fences on burials.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the SBU "Ritual" told about the readiness to install electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to the cemeteries will be able to learn GPS-coordinates and number plates of burials.
In June this year, the Ritual State Administration also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
So, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in the winter, when the land is frozen.
Over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have risen by an average of 10 percent.
Five days later, in the Elnine forests, a lost mushroom grower was found.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without provisions.
It was possible to find the grief mushroom thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, a correspondent: "79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
Without food or water.
He was sought by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even cynologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was found after a helicopter connected to the search work.
On that day Vitaly Alexandrovich went to the forest as usual to get the berms and berms, but by the evening he did not return.
Relatives immediately asked for help, and the next day rescuers and indifferent residents from the neighboring village were raised to search for the fungus - only about 30 people.
On the fifth day, a helicopter of the fire and rescue center joined them.
Andrei Seletkov, the head of the search and rescue team of the fire and rescue center of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He went far, far away, somewhere else.
It was about 12 km from the search area.
He traveled a great distance at his age.
Miracle is alive.
Gribnik was taken to the central district hospital in Jelna unconscious, in an extremely serious condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia.
How an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days spent in the forest, doctors have no idea.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Elnin CDC: "Assigned examination to the patient, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich comes to Smolensk every year from the Tambov region.
His grandson says that his grandfather had gone to collect mushrooms before, but he never went deep into the forest.
Alexey Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom picker, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, it is not local in principle."
He spent a few years visiting his relatives.
Well, I went for the mushrooms.
I guess he went a long way and got lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
There have been five similar cases in the last few days.
Rescuers remind: in the forest you need to walk in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and a compass.
In addition, it is advisable to leave traces so that later you can go back.
Emergency An-2 sat on the average in the fraternal taiga.
Right on the average sat in Siberia emergency An-2.
An emergency landing aircraft of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Yenisei" made 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no casualties or casualties, but the plane itself was severely damaged when it landed.
An-2 made a service flight.
There were three crew members on board - the commander, the co-pilot and the flight mechanic, Interfax reports.
The emergency aircraft was flying on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already been brought to Bratsk.
The fraternal transport prosecutor’s office after the emergency landing of the An-2 began checking compliance with the legislation on flight safety.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor’s Office went to the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their plane with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned taiga airfield in Komi.
The engines and onboard electronics failed, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured during the emergency landing of the plane.
News Economy <0xE2><0x80><0x95> Nobel laureate: globalization
The processes of globalization should have contributed to reducing inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, the income gap in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Muskin.
To fix this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to Eric Maskin, chief researcher at the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Choice at HSE, the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
The borders between the two countries were becoming more open.
Supporters of globalization predicted great benefits for emerging economies.
“And these predictions have come true in many ways,” Muskin emphasizes.
China and India, for example, have experienced significant growth in GDP per capita.
However, not everything is so rainbow.
Globalization was expected to narrow the gap between the “poor” and the “poor” in poor countries, which is reflected in high income inequality, or rather wage inequality.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, says Eric Maskin in his article “Why Global Markets Haven’t Reduced Inequality in Emerging Economies,” published in The World Bank Economic Review, translated and quoted by the HSE.
Together with Harvard University economist Michael Kremer, Eric Muskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries increases as globalization grows.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Muskin allocates four skill levels - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the level of qualification to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And while C-level workers in poor countries are rising salaries through co-operation with B-level workers from the rich, D-level workers are not feeling growth or their salaries are falling at all.
The overall effect is that internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, consequently, to an increase in inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality,” says Fuad Aleskerov, associate professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-Selection, head of the Mathematics Department at HSE.
And like any powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to a surge in empirical work in this field.
The solution, according to Eric Muskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the employees themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the funds for this, and it is unprofitable for companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations can play a significant role, Muskin believes.
The scientist notes that the theory developed in no case calls for stopping the process of globalization, which has brought and bears its fruits in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: The Living Connection of Time.
Derbent - one of the oldest cities in Russia - in September celebrates its 2000th anniversary.
The program of festive events includes a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of past times, an exhibition of Derbent carpets and the Day of Open Temples, a historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed museum of Peter I.
Medieval stones of the Naryn-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all this seems to come down from the pages of "Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has survived in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Khaganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the Eastern Platans, which grow in the yard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Trees - monuments of wildlife".
The shadow of the spreading crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitor of the mosque will be poured fragrant tea and treated with Dagestani delicacies - honey figs, persimmon, mussels, marvelous pastries, ayran and sweets.
In Derbent, from time immemorial, large samovars have been used to give tea to numerous guests at one time.
An inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 A.D.H.
That is, in the year 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking in scope and solemnity: the arcades of domes and vaults rest on square columns and are illuminated by the sun's rays from tiny windows.
The maintenance and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of the residents of Derbent.
Owners of poultry put pigeons in the yards, under the trees, in the attics.
An exciting sight is the ascent into the sky of a pack of white pigeons, similar to the flashes of a festive fireworks display.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
Leaving 500 meters into the sea, this structure closed the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best-preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
The carpets in Derbent were woven in the 5th century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets for every taste are sold - stripes of wool, cotton or felt of all colors and shades, with and without a pile, with intricate ornaments and a quirky border.
The construction of the city began with mounds - blocks with one-storey stone buildings.
Over the years, the moguls have hardly changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioning on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in a medieval, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of the waterworks built by the Persians about a thousand years ago are preserved.
To this day have reached the ancient springs, in which the locals and today collect water.
Many Derbents prefer ordinary tap water to water from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the centers of the pottery craft.
Watering and painted vases, dishes, jars, cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.
Hands of potters and now make wonderful ceramic products both practical and souvenir purposes.
On holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a tight rope, on which students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship has several centuries.
A new trend - among rope walkers can be seen more and more often girls.
In the premises of the former Maiden's Bath, today there is a museum "Culture and Life of Ancient Derbent".
Previously, unmarried girls and brides accompanied by girlfriends were washed here, and now anyone can see the vaulted-dome hall, hot and cold pools, past accessories for swimming.
Most of Derbent’s homes have hot water, but baths and steam baths are as popular today as they were in the old days.
About the benefits of heating the body by steam is written in ancient books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and lightness.
The festival "Sodruzhestvo", which takes place on the territory of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, is attended by ethnic courtyards of many districts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, perform songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kirchlyar is the burial place of forty martyrs who lay down their heads for Islam.
This is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims of the North Caucasus.
Yellowed from time to time, the sarcophagi are carved out of solid stone blocks and oriented, as is customary among the Arabs, along the west-east axis.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubovy cut and shave clients in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The hairdresser has been at this place for many years.
Receptions of the barber craft are passed down from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yakubov brothers can make not only the traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old Town there is a house in which the writer-Decembrist Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, who was sent to the Caucasus, lived.
After learning the Turkic language and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third of the XIX century with its ancient monuments, life and life of citizens.
Chaikhana is a traditional club of the East, where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, chat with friends and solve some work problems.
As in past times, women are not recommended to cross the threshold of the teahouse.
Derbent dance ensemble "Caspian" was created three years ago, but already managed to take part in events of the republican and Russian level.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, learning the folk Avar, Dargin, Tat and Armenian dances perfectly.
With the onset of the evening, when the noise subsides and street lights are lit, locals sit on benches near houses with protruding terraces.
As a rule, Derbentsy discuss domestic issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they increasingly remember episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
In Domodedovo, a business "game at the airport" was held.
There is a new form of education in the capital.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport staff.
To do this, Domodedovo installed models of three aircraft hauls.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also serviced aircraft.
All this in the form of a business game, but in complexity it was not inferior to reality.
Delayed flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the ladder was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, it's hell.
For the one who settled in the Domodedovo hangar - a standard set of tasks to be solved by beginners.
In one hangar fit three major airports from different countries of the world.
Today they employ four hundred students from the capital's colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn everything about the inner world of the air harbor.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance, baggage turnover - they were even entrusted with buses on the flight field, ladders and passenger inspection.
Passengers are problematic.
One has a mess with documents, another is late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you need to deal with all this, as in life - in a minimum period of time.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual funds, as if the airline paid them the corresponding amounts for the service of the flight.
"For non-performance of the relevant tasks with them is charged a fine," - explains in an interview with the program "Vesti-Moscow" financial analyst of the game Dmitry Khilko.
This is closely monitored by officials from the Ministry of Education.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of learning.
She has already found a place in the course of secondary vocational education.
"Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will become, in fact, new models of the activities of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment," Natalia Zolotareva, director of the Department of State Policy in the field of training of workers and additional professional education of the Ministry of Science of Russia, said.
But students are not up to global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need a day off.
But the scores for this exam had quite a material expression.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
“I received them for responding to the claim to our airport on Instagram in a timely manner,” said Sergey Shuvalov, a participant of the game and a PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team.
The best judges, as they say, took on a pencil to invite to work at the time of graduation.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The U.S. Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the American Center for Foreign Literature.
The center has been operating in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the U.S. Embassy at the All-Russian Rudominium State Library in Moscow.
"Unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation recently cast doubt on the Russian government's commitment to ties between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries," U.S. Ambassador John Tefft said in a statement.
The American Center created deep and strong ties between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a meeting place with numerous American eminent figures, among whom were astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Last year alone, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors,” the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) educational exchange program.
The Green Tribunal was quick to retaliate.
Typical situation: four officials stand in front of the table of Judge Svatanter Kumar, listening to his complaints about the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
“We did not give you a 110-page order to make fun of it,” Kumar said.
If one more brick is laid, we will order the demolition of all existing buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NGT), a judiciary body established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has had time to consider more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are unbelievably high: in the less than 60 years since the declaration of independence of industrial development, India has evolved from a land of virgin jungles into one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large metropolitan areas, where infrastructure development does not keep pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and few remaining residential areas are cut down for construction with new residential quarters.
Despite formal support for the green movement from the state, NZT is regularly criticized by the Narendra Modi government, as it is often the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May, the environment minister called the court’s decisions “extreme” and “unenforceable”.
Sometimes it is really impossible to execute the court’s decisions within the court’s deadline, environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani confirms.
However, impossible deadlines have a positive side: at least they make the responsible persons move.
“His main goal is to shake up this system,” the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled major construction projects, including the cessation of the construction of an airport, a power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time, people also try not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnana, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
“People will lose their jobs,” Kumar said.
However, such explanations do not always find understanding in ordinary people, whose lives can be changed by one sketch of a judge's pen.
In April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over the age of 10 from entering the capital, which caused public outrage.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and a flurry of criticism, Svatanter Kumar refused to reverse this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Delhi government on incoming and outgoing vehicles, as well as a proposal to purchase 10,000 additional buses, having previously learned from the factories whether they were able to fulfill such an order.
As sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to fall into the court’s attention, the people’s anger began to subside.
But the most sickening topic of the principled judge was the program to clean up the Ganges River, with a pomp announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a sacred river for the Hindus, the judge often stops restraining his emotions and goes to shout.
Do you know what the word “saint” means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges on a statue of God, and in it there were feces, - the judge says.
You continue to pollute the river because you think the Ganges is the Ganges, it will take away all our sins.
This is a river that we worship, and look what you do with it every day.
The Ganges Cleanup is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.
Every year, between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 million Indians who swim in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganges Rescue Fund from the sale of his costume, in which he met Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for 700 thousand dollars, while cleaning the river requires at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that the price of progress should be the environment.
“In a developing country, talking about the environment is often perceived as an unacceptable luxury,” says Call of the Ganges activist Malika Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a golden middle ground between ecology and development.”
A man poured blood on several paintings of Dali at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the exhibition of the Latvian Union of Artists in Riga broke the windows in the museum and ruined the sculpture of Salvador Dali "The Appearance of an Angel".
Currently, the museum hosts an exhibition of works by Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
A man born in 1985 entered the sculpture hall at 2:20 p.m.
He immediately led inadequately: ruined the sculpture, broke the windows.
Then he began to move around the premises and stained with blood several works of permanent exposition.
Among them is a portrait of a Message of a Brush by Miervaldis Polis.
According to the president of the Latvian Union of Artists, Igor Dobychin, to whom Interfax refers, the windows were also spoiled.
Police and art experts are working at the scene.
The latter determine the extent of damage and damage.
A criminal case of hooliganism was opened against the man.
From August 4 to September 27, the Latvian Union of Artists hosts an exhibition of works by Picasso and Dali, which presents more than 200 original works by artists.

Xi Jinping calls for more open economy to the world
The economy needs to become more open to the world to spur growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday in an address to a group facing the challenge of leading reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness,” he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group Committee on Comprehensive Deepening Reforms.
According to him, the expansion of openness and deepening of reforms will give the economy new momentum and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including on the introduction of regulation of investor access to the market, changing the rules of border control, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOE) to attract private capital and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be compiled.
The system will gradually debug through trial programs.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more significant role in allocating resources, ensuring the rule of law in the business sphere and increasing openness, the statement said.
The government will also loosen control over the powers granted to companies, thereby ensuring that companies run their own businesses.
The statement also said China would allow border regions to adopt new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to boost local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors to increase the openness of the state-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies, as well as provide them with better conditions,” the statement said.
The procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or “green card”, will be further facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
