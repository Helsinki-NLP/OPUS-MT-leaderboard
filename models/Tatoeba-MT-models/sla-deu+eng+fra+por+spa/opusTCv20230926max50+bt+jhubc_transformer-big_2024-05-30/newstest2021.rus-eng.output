Semilarski vs Prosecutor’s Office: Former Deputy Mayor of Tartu to be cassed on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the two first instances refused to consider Semilarski’s claim, but in April his cassation appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its resolution did not fall within its jurisdiction.
The court ' s ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
“The prosecutor’s office and the county court should regulate such matters,” Anette Kreitsmann, a spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, told ERR earlier.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the state will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski’s lawyer, juror Oliver Nyas, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now demands that the prosecutor’s office refute the false allegations against him and compensate him for the moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint to the court were the statements of the Prosecutor for Special Cases of the Lyuna District Prosecutor’s Office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with the other Deputy Mayor of Tartu, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
“When I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor’s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local governments, were corrupt.
These public suspicions hung in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions turned out to be false, the prosecutor’s office does not want to say anything about it,” Semilarski said in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyas, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor’s office should operate.
“The allegation of bribery and corruption turned out to be false, but that’s not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation, representatives of the state should be careful in choosing words so that suspects would not be presented as criminals before the verdict.
The prosecutor’s office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, has not been observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” said Nees.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being established is unacceptable, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant,” the lawyer added.
According to rus.err.ee, the former deputy mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted on bribery charges - the criminal case initiated against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu more than thirty times participated in meetings of the city administration when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated at a personal level during off-hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, according to rus.err.ee, the prosecutor’s office presented Semilarsky with suspicions of receiving bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Center Party).
At that time, the prosecutor’s office and the security police said that there was strong evidence against both deputy mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
The Suvorov case later reached the court, which fully justified the politician.
The trial of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.

How the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally the next historical low.
Judging by the return of the short step of lowering the rate, as well as the tone of the statements of the Central Bank and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon come to a halt.
“We have continued to ease monetary policy, primarily considering that the risks of inflation deviating down from 4% in 2021 still remain,” said Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Bank of Russia.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
The economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes have revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand have recovered, construction and production of consumer goods have expanded, the annual rate of decrease in cargo turnover of transport and industrial production has slowed.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economic contraction will be 4.5-5.5% (previously it was expected 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected $ 27 and $ 35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia’s inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The view of the Bank of Russia on the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to economists for Russia and the CIS "Renaissance Capital" Sophia Donetsk and Andrei Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has consistently lowered the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the slowing economy due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of further adjustment of monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is close, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to the imminence of a pause in interest-rate easing – disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and a faster (compared to expectations) demand recovery, he says.
In addition, the Bank of Russia’s subsequent actions will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts.
One way or another, the reduction of the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, perhaps, on the mortgage, says senior economist of the analytical management of the bank "Otkritie" Maxim Petronevych.
The correction of rates will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarifies.

Poll: the ruling Union of peasants and "green" Lithuania again topped the ranking of parties
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Sejm, led the ranking of parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus for the order of the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.

This statement caused outrage from the Conservatives.

In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.

Unnecessary requirements for public procurement applications shall be excluded by law
The legislation may lay down exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session at the plenary session, the State Duma plans to consider in the second reading a bill establishing the requirements for the content and composition of the application for participation in the procurement, the participants of which can be only subjects of small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are made by the government to the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities".
The draft law is developed in accordance with the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of the application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized enterprises.
And also - about the list of requirements for these documents.
To date, the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
Requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the purchase are set by the customers independently in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers establish excessive requirements for the content, registration of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the period of receipt of which in the authorized bodies is comparable with the period of submission of applications, which leads to the impossibility of participation in such a procurement and reducing the number of participants in the procurement," the explanatory note to the bill reads.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of the application from procurement participants who are subjects of small and medium-sized enterprises.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are subjects of small and medium-sized enterprises," the explanatory note reads.

During working trips to the areas of the Ust-Ordynsk Buryatia district, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their performance.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda was resumed.
The order for this object was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now has the situation been moved from a deadlock.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
The deadline for the construction is 2022.
And already this year, the school in the village of Bayandai should be commissioned.
At the moment, the finishing of the premises is completed.
Of the remaining works - landscaping.
In general, the program of construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
Especially for your county.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for education and leisure for children of all ages," said Igor Kobzev, acting Governor of the Irkutsk Region.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively participate in the work on the development of general plans of settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements should have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant objects, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region emphasized.
Also in the course of the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with the reduction of milk intake by cooperatives by 30%.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing enterprise of milk purchases in favor of peasant-farmer farms.
Due to this, the share of product intake in cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the Acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and determine options for solving the problem.

The authorities of the Moscow region told about the fate of closed landfills
In the suburbs continue to close landfills of solid household waste.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being upgraded to modern waste disposal complexes.
But this option is not possible for every polygon - many of them are overgrown with dense residential buildings.
After the polygon is closed, it stands for recultivation - the body of the polygon is overflowing with soil, degassing and infiltrate drainage systems are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not emit stench, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains to rise up a useless pile among the surrounding residential buildings.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in the Ruza, where just a few days ago the rehabilitation of the polygon "Annino", the authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope out of a pile.
This polygon, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, expanded so that it went beyond the boundaries of the allocated land for it.
Therefore, during recultivation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring plots, de facto already stuffed with garbage for a long time.
"Some time will pass, the training ground will "sit down", the fortress will be built, and we will think what can be done to make it useful.
The ski resort is eye-catching,” the head of the Ruz district, Nikolai Parfenov, told reporters.
Two polygons will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo polygons in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in the Bogoro district will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
The gas-piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeyev by the end of the year, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will provide its own needs of the polygon - heating of administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste treatment complex.
And at the Balashikha polygon "Kuchino", which was closed after complaints of residents on the "Straight line" with the president of the country, a museum can be created.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum for the rehabilitation of polygons in the Moscow region," - said the deputy head of government - the Minister of ecology and environmental management of the region Dmitry Kurakin.

Beautiful high minarets only adorned Aya-Sofia
Once again about Aya-Sofia - got the text of Father Vladimir Zelinsky, that, they say, you need to protest.
First of all, there was a free entrance - hooray!
I have not been to Istanbul, but it is better to enter the House of God free of charge than paid.
Secondly, the Muslims conquered this land just as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Ok inter-river, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God help me!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to give it back to everyone?
Do you think there will be no Gentiles who will demand the return of their temple, in the place of which the Church of the Tenth is?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved the building, invested in it.
That is, it, like the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeoisie as their property, belongs to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They have improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it’s all theirs by the right of the progressives.
Beautiful high minarets very decorated Ayia Sophia, very.
There was a stupid inkhouse, a stupid inkhouse with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no “Islamic” and “Orthodox” civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites who unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of the official of the British Foreign Ministry Toynbee, who is ashamed to think so.
Every believer has a place of prayer.
And always.
A believer does not pray only where he is asked to depart; he departs to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defendant.
We're cobblestones, not grumbling stones.

The president of the Russian Football Union (RFU), Alexander Dyukov, believes that it is wrong to expand the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams at the moment.
"Firstly, it was a decision of the RPL, but I will agree with it, because it is wrong to change the rules after the tournament is over.

Kirilenko shared his memories of playing with Bryant and Jordan in the NBA
The head of the Russian Basketball Federation (RFB) Andrei Kirilenko shared his memories of his games against the legendary Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan in the matches of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
I knew that Bryant’s self-love could not be touched by some sort of thrash-stream, so as not to stimulate his athletic anger.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so on the pitch I tried to talk to him so that he did not perceive the game in an aggressive way.
At the playground I complimented him: “Oh!
Kobe, good score, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he almost forgot that it is necessary to take the ball in his hands again and score another 3 - 4 points.
We communicated well with Kobe," Kirilenko said.
He also spoke about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match, I ran in complete admiration of having a legend next to me that I only saw on television.
While I was breathless with joy, Michael scored a lot of points.
Soon I got away from the excitement, a couple of times I covered his throws...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points,” added the head of the RFB.

Interim Governor of the Khabarovsk Territory Mikhail Degtyarev on Sunday, July 26, during a meeting with residents of Soviet Havana was surprised that the region buys Sakhalin gas, mined by the American company Exxon Neftegas, for dollars.

Degtyarev noted that this issue was discussed with the head of the Russian Energy Ministry Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The acting governor also stressed that by 2025, Gazprom will switch to supplying Russian TPPs and capacities, which means that Russian gas, purchased in rubles, will be used “at normal prices”.
The Sakhalin-1 project is implemented through a production-sharing agreement, where Exxon Neftegas Ltd is the operator of the project with a share of 30%, another 20% for Rosneft, 30% for Sodeco from Japan and 20% for ONGC from India.

The actor of the Russian series responded to accusations of “propaganda of LGBT and feminism”
The actor of the Russian series “Chicks”, whose creators were accused of “propaganda of LGBT and feminism”, responded to the claims to the film.
The authors “understood the severity of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone,” said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication “Lift”.
“It seems to me that this is a story about the power and general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism,” said the actor, who played the boy’s father, who was dressed in women’s clothing.
He stressed that he is "proud of the work" and does not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is afraid of the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in deep drunkenness shot the set and said that all this is not true."
“Then there were a couple of cases where we met dissatisfied locals who did not understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who first came with complaints began to help us,” he concluded.
The incident with the shooting, explains the publication, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunken man attacked the car of the film crew with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public Commissioner for the protection of the family Olga Baranets sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor to the service more.tv, which hosted the Russian series "Chicks".
Lamb accused the creators of the series of “propaganda of unconventional sexual relations and feminism”, drawing attention to the fact that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains “scenes of physical and psychological violence”.
The Ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that “a lot of attention is paid to the homosexual sexual orientation” of the minor character.
The comedy drama "Chicky" tells the story of three prostitutes who started a new life and opened a business on the advice of a friend.
