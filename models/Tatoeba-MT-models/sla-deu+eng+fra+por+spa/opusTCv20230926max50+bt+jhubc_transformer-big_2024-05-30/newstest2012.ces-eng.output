The Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
Ukraine’s parliament has rejected a proposal to repeal the paragraph on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted under an amendment to the Criminal Code.
The amendment, which would have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned Prime Minister, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the proposal to ease the punishment for economic crimes.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly concluding an unfavourable contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final, the convicted person’s appeal is due to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko called the verdict a political revenge of the regime, and the suspicion of bias in the court sparked a trial in the West.
The proposal to remove section 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 MPs in a vote.
It needed 226 votes to pass.
The Libyan Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, Islamists win the elections, but it is a matter of moderation or radicalism.
The Transitional National Council has signed up for Sharia customary law, and we already have some idea about it.
Libya will become a country without crime, for theft is a crime.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates from the faith await execution, and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we certainly would not want.
However, our way of life is neither the only one nor objectively the best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans just mentioned for a change.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic warriors took the help of unbelieving dogs.
The only apologies are that from their point of view, it was not a general from America who directed the NATO strikes, but Allah, whose greatness they celebrated with every successful intervention.
So when it comes to winning in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in a shootout, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the person of a dictator, without guaranteeing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
Thus, the locals eliminate the problem with the expulsion of "crusaders".
But without the occupation, will the oil companies have Libyan black gold for a sneak peek?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
Unless, of course, those Shariahs are stopping us.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are on the lookout for investors
A statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Each country published its GDP data for the 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated inter-quarterly, Germany and France are growing.
Today, however, the bond market is breaking records.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published preliminary estimates of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany was better off than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), while France said that it appeared in a slight decline of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter.
However, quarter-on-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated, confirming the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts’ estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated quarter-on-quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter according to preliminary and seasonally adjusted data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2% year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical levels.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc. are starting to feel the problems...
Yields on Czech 10-year bonds are below 4%, even as the situation in the region worsens.
There are voices from Germany that the ECB should be the lender of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and celebrate the promotion for 200 million
The football team has accomplished the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to a great Czech and a beautiful goalie Peter Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek won 1: 0.
Czech football, even with a great deal of luck in the second half, defended a luxury lead from the domestic retaliation and will not be missing the European championship again.
IMMEDIATE.cz followed the progress match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech national team also thanks to home defeat in the final, the great Czech and hero Jira<0xC4><0x8D>ek won in Montenegro happy 1: 0 and celebrates progress to the European Championship.
The Montenegrins, due to the precise defense of the Czech team, came under pressure only in the second half.
Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D> became the bad guys of the match, who burned two great chances.
Even thanks to the great Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, in addition, a prize of about 200 million crowns will arrive at the box office of domestic football.
There has been a lot of fighting football since the first few minutes.
Both teams were difficult to get involved in the combination and played mostly around the half-line.
The pressure of domestic football players did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense accurately deterred long kicks for defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
Created a human shield
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the building at noon on Tuesday and then shouted death to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, formed a live shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center on Tuesday.
They show that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a recent report that Iran does not appear to have ceased its pursuit of nuclear weapons.
There is talk of a possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities in Israel.
The students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then shouted death to America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at paralyzing Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, Israel’s press said it would also target a facility in Natanz that enriches uranium, in addition to the Isfahan center.
The menu of an obese child: does not eat breakfast and dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of schoolchildren being overweight and 5 percent of children being obese.
Obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, according to a recent survey.
It shows once again how important it is for the healthy development of a person’s environment in which he grows up and the patterns that surround him.
For example, on the tables of obese children, sausages appear up to half as often as in families of normal-weight children.
The French fries were served for dinner the day before a study linked to an awareness campaign called Obesity Not a Coincidence by more than 19 percent of the obese.
In fat families, it is also not a habit to do sports, which is true for most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children answered that their parents at least once a week find time for active movement.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic participated in it.
It was the second year of the Obesity Not a Coincidence event, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 pupils from grades 4 to 8 have participated in the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of children who are overweight or even obese.
"For example, only half of those surveyed said they ate breakfast-lunch-lunch-lunch-dinner five times a day, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition," one of the results of the study said.
No breakfast and evening sausage
Experts point out that relative details are essential for healthy development, including regular family breakfast times.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst part was finding that in a tenth of the households, there was no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are much more often consumed.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
While more than 40 percent of children surveyed regularly do sports, their parents scored less than half - 15 percent.
Make your own diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own menu according to their own taste and opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
"The high popularity of sweet lemonades is particularly alarming," the study's final report said.
At lunch, the pasta just above the poultry prevailed as the main dish.
But the children practically did not like legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and noon vegetable dishes is also low.
An Approach to Health
The study also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the educational lecture Obesity is not a coincidence, in many cases there has been a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the project results state.
This was notable, for example, for sweet lemonades, where more children would prefer ordinary water.
Children were also much more likely to tick poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and cut back on sweet foods and dumplings.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, say experts
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I complained a little bit that there was a lot already in the introductory class.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
Lectures by three professionals from the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes on the set.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "trodden".
This time, Director Alenka and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And that's the overwhelming majority.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boyish figure without proper curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually soften wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the necessary curves.
We got tips on how to make a woman like Jennifer Lopez, bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, nicely emphasize the figure and at the same time do not dress the woman too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers really do not fit, then it is worth having at least one such piece tailored.
You will certainly not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are invaluable.
In a tailor-made skirt, you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves you, grinds, lags in the waist and the like.
The boy's figure can also afford to wear clothes with eyelashes, applications, embroidery or picking.
Of course, there is a lot of such information and types of characters, so I am glad that I have a whole week to sort all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that, given the homework you've been given, it's too much.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to come up with two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the person and the type of character.
I'm going to dress up Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my mind, I'm glad, for me personally, definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained a hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or the young Selena Gomez.
Clothes must be cut from magazines or searched on the Internet and printed and then graphically processed.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, then expresses our personal style and relationship to graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic side of styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific tasks, for example, trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday’s lecture filled with information about the types of characters was enriched by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is key in this case.
So, for example, such a trenchcoat (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt as a coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on your sandals and take pictures as a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collars and immediately the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he said.
But what I appreciated the most was the following advice: "To work you need to know the rules perfectly."
'Then you can start breaking them, 'Jacob said.
Finally, I understand why we are crushing all these ideas, what to combine with what, for what, why, when at the same time we sometimes see something different in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have prepared many more options of clothes than how many can be photographed.
So for a fashion story that will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "set" at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo clothes look and work in combination with other pieces sometimes completely different than in reality.
This is what we need to take into account when creating our outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half of the success, Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> confirmed to us.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miracle singer, but the image and marketing made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists is rather cold.
And I know that I have a lot of knowledge, and I know that I have a lot of knowledge, and I know that I have a lot of knowledge.
And if someone from us has to create a styling, then we have to count on the fact that it is likely to dictate us a completely different (smaller) size than it really has.
Then it remains only to google and find out if the tabloid did not write about the fact that the celebrity got fat / lost weight and the like.
Both Honza and Mario put on our hearts on Sunday that it is not enough for a stylist to orient himself in fashion and be able to fold outfits.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to be condescending, to stand up for one's opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out her closet and fill it with nice pieces, you can't throw the whole closet away and say, 'Oh, my God, that's awful.'"
"Find at least a few things there that you will praise and recommend for what they can be worn," says Mario.
He also showed us specifically what the so-called "placovka", or bag for the set, must contain.
It is the one that you fasten around your waist and you have all the necessary proprietary items with you.
In addition to bright things such as scissors, hair roller or closing pins, there is also a nylon thread (with it the stylist helps when photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips that we attach to the back of the clothes, if it is larger (a pin or other clamp would not be allowed, the clamp would not be permissible,
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to properly skate shoes.
Even when shooting in the studio, where there is a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
So we glued and glued.
Scissors should not even touch the shoes, so as not to accidentally damage them.
So you really need skill.
Mario was delighted when he praised my creation unreservedly.
This skill is not really my friend.
This is only a small fraction of what we have heard about the second weekend sequel to the course.
It is becoming more and more clear to me that styling at a professional level is really not a walk in a rose garden, no matter who wants to say what they want.
Need for Speed: The Run races across the United States.
Recent Reviews
Originally a carefree ride, due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes, turns into a routine morning trip to the shift.
The ambition was largely fulfilled, but it is nothing if no one obviously wanted to do anything extra.
The new episode with the subtitle The Run aroused high expectations before the release.
He promised to move the old racing series Need for Speed in a new direction again, and from playable demos it seemed like a game that in the genre of action racing would not have to be just in number.
We were also curious to see how the embedded passages would turn out, in which the main character gets out of the car and runs on his own.
However, as is customary in the NFS series, many things are a little different in the end than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole drags down a few unnecessary bugs that have been appearing in the series for more or less several years.
So these are not actually mistakes, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story whose main character Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You will be driving on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea carries with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race runs on a different track and the stages are set in different, quite different and interesting environments.
It doesn’t feel like the game is always the same.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's not world-class.
But driving through the desert, autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.
In addition, from time to time the races are varied by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught in a sandstorm, which greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you must be careful not to be overwhelmed by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are quite well put in place.
There are only a few types, but that’s enough.
For a while you try to overtake the required number of opponents (basically a classic race), then you catch up again (a classic duel with stopwatches) and then a duel with a single opponent awaits you.
From time to time, the police will also get involved, making your efforts even more unpleasant.
New is the passages outside the car.
It's more like an interactive animation, where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him in this way by printing the right buttons at the right moments.
It's not complicated.
Surprisingly, there are far fewer of these passages in the game than you might expect (in particular, perhaps only three).
In the end, however, it is in favor of the thing, because this element has no chance to become annoying and in the context of the above, it ranks among the elements that diversify the game.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that it is certainly not much nowadays, but it cannot be said to be a negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more action-packed racing here still suits the driving model quite well, even though we could find a better one in the competition.
So far, everything is in perfect order.
However, problems begin to appear after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is no longer very good.
We do not expect this type of game to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if practically before any impact on any object you have no idea how your car will behave, then probably not all is well.
Typically, when overtaking or passing cars in normal traffic, sometimes you just lick each other slightly, but sometimes in almost identical situations, your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even be attacked.
Thanks to the system of restarts, it does not particularly bother, but it will detangle you reliably.
Restarts are solved so that if you break or drive far off the track, the game will throw you back to the last catch point on the track.
Only five restarts are available in each race.
When you have exhausted them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it is more of a help in case something fails, rather than that you can rely on them explicitly.
Sometimes even restarts will not help, they will be solved by the need to learn a given section of the race by heart.
The big drawback of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some corners need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply will not fit into them.
Other times you will meet at a given place "civilian" cars always in the same configuration whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see how between two opposite cars the opponent in front of you passes easily, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass or brake them.
It does not matter when you reach them, because it is "calculated" so that the situation always occurs right in front of your nose.
The rivals have another advantage.
Throughout the game, you will come across several places where, again, no matter the time, you will always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
It hits the most at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you drive in the opposite direction.
Obviously, the enemy must get in front of you at any cost.
When it drives in front of you, it makes it worse for you to see the cars on the other side, so at first you have to smear it a couple of times.
You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline, but the execution is so obvious that it will reliably disgust you quickly.
And it is a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and sometimes so action-packed that sometimes you literally do not have time to watch where everything flies.
And it doesn’t matter if it’s a concept with fifty unique tracks, sorting races so that boredom doesn’t have a chance, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gas stations on the roads, because that is where you can change the car, although in most cases you can do with what you have right now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American crashes on straight highways, and exotic supersports for technical riding, such as on winding mountain roads.
The main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points to your profile, which is common to challenges and storytelling.
To gain a higher driver level, various items are unlocked: starting with cars and ending with profile backgrounds.
At the same time, it is again connected to the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your results with other players and provides other community features.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the subway tunnel (bu<0xC5><0xBE>), where you run in the dark on the tracks (bu<0xC5><0xBE>).
On the tachometer, numbers between 150 and 200 km/h flash (yes) and a subway train arrives from behind and uncompromisingly knocks you down.
In the editorial office, we will probably have a few more days of discussions about whether nobody really thought a little while creating the game, or whether the authors think that we are really such idiots.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It freezes in such a way that in some tense moments the shooting decreases, and in some cases quite tragically.
This is especially true of crashes with a larger number of participants, when smooth shooting would no longer be useful to you.
The sound side is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to the widest possible range of rather younger audiences, a soundtrack from the category "every dog is a different village" was created, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, someone will probably not buy the game.
Need for Speed: The Run is a very good game.
If the game avoided completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best NFS work of the last few years.
This is how the game looks unfinished.
The fun is certainly fine, but be prepared for the fact that mistakes will crack you in the eyes with the power of airport headlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation for negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has severely disrupted the balance between the various institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five or six years for the situation to settle down a little, calm down and for all players to get used to their new roles," Milena Vicenova, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
The extent to which she takes her motto "Comprehensibly and openly about Europe" seriously, she showed in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in a clear and understandable way so that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the UK could envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, there was criticism that he was inconspicuous, that he was a gray clerk, that he couldn't play any role, and I have to say that everyone was breathless, that he played the role perfectly."
"He's a man who listens to, communicates well with, and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
She then explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in response to the question: "Who is the European Union? What phone number should I call?" as an important step towards unification and greater readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban cheese.
Vicen also addressed the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live on in the near future.
She called the Czech presidency a success.
The Czechs solved the impending financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was described as a great negative, which damaged the Czech Republic very badly.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, the "fact frmol" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is being tackled to this day.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is greatly complicated by the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and austere, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which less, is all on the agenda for the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe clearly".
"I really don't like bad shortcuts, foreign words, gossip that no one understands.
How is the citizen supposed to understand that curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes are not really invented in Brussels, or that we really have to be banned from cheeses.
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people who pay attention to the negative rather than the positive aspects of things.
Moreover, it regrets the low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me will say, 'Hey, what are you meeting there, what is your Visegrad Four?'
In the future of the Union, according to Vicen, there are mainly new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the member states.
He sees the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe as very real, rather than a new "European federation."
"We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area, we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that only countries that want to cooperate should cooperate, and those that don’t want to stay away.”
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues that have an impact on the entire Union should be discussed among all Member States, not only between euro area countries.
Brand story:
Innovator IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone was looking for a word that would most accurately express IBM’s strategy, the closest approach would probably be “long term.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very modern, and yet a hundred years have passed since its founding.
The foundation of this long-termness was laid by the first CEO of the company, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
Already he had coined the slogan that many of the world’s problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" became the imprint around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson’s carefully built corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values and was not afraid to change everything else around it.
This has enabled us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the second hundred,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current CEO.
Sophisticated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the care of his employees in a similar way to Bata’s Czech entrepreneur – IBM people were among the first American employees to have paid leave, employer insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system for rewarding the best inventors and traders.
IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
The company was a genius in extracting talent from the start - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination so that it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is for Palmisan to be replaced by a woman, Virginia Rometty, at the head of IBM next year.
She has been with IBM for 30 years and is currently Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called pits, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder there are so many ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with a good reputation
A firm position in the business is ensured by the firm’s strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor at Harvard Business School and author of the IBM book.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, the difference between this is to enter the market and thus directly create the market.
IBM - or "Big Blue", as it is popularly nicknamed in the United States because of its logo - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company – developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
She holds the most patents of any U.S. technology company, and five of her employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode, or a floppy disk.
IBM is the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year (the first being Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking Forward
Not all products and innovations have hit the tastes of customers and times - IBM, for example, failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online services Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t get emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms – and when they don’t work, abandon them.
Unlike, for example, the competing Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
IBM accounts for the largest share of IBM’s revenues, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth.
In 1990, it was still the strongest representative of hardware with more than half the share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yielding assets, during which time it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It has continued to invest since 2008, when the modern financial crisis overwhelmed the world for the first time.
IBM follows the legacy of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis unscathed.
The price of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, the net profit of the company is constantly growing.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything but your values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will cope with it.
IBM History: From Cheese Slicer to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, originally under the complex name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was not adopted until 1924, when it was originally used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM was the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous "punchers," that is, clocks recording employees' arrivals and departures.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired the supervisory board of the company.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas are still built on an invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of all sorts of machines for business - from meat slicers and cheese to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, the company’s turnover doubled to $9 million and began a large-scale expansion to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after almost forty years in the chair of the boss, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly into space - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "peck" that set the computer standard of the time, called IBM 5150, came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer manufacturing to the Chinese company Lenovo, bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and began to fully dedicate itself to high-value-added consulting and services.
The strategy that has paid off in the last three years for IBM is the concept of Smarter Planet, the “smarter planet.”
Its goal is the smart use of technology in previously unplanned areas and the improvement of the situation, for example, in transport or urban management.
IBM recently launched the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps merchants manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history at home.
It established its branch in the then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM Czech Republic, it also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Headquartered in Prague, Central and Eastern Europe has a world-class voice recognition research team.
The Unfaithful Husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rykhtárová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>, 53, became not only the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová, 45, but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But she didn't want to wait any longer and set clear rules for her next life.
"Pepa can go home, but not as my partner," Rykhtárová explained.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová granted asylum to Barto<0xC5><0xA1> at her home in the summer, she apparently had no idea how her marriage would end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved away from <0xC5><0x98>í<0xC4><0x8D>an after 30 days at her insistence, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, seemingly reconciled with her husband's relationship, and now even gave him a farewell forever.
A knight doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rykhtár and Barto<0xC5><0xA1> broke up once, his wife's open arms would not be waiting for him at home.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live in our common house, no one will drive him out."
"But she will live to see him, not as my beloved, wandering old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," said Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová, saying that she had already detached herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't mind Darina closing the back door.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm going to be with Iveta, and I'm not going to change that."
"My wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company moves on, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, the shopping."
"Darina and I are having a very normal conversation, except we don't share a bed," said Lightning Rider.
If she finds a new love, she won’t stop it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, or if he has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility,” concluded Josef.
Women’s Worst Habits: Do They Affect You?
When you ask men if they can name any typical female bad habits, as a rule, all of them are very quickly thrown out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, which lists several female bad habits that can perfectly pump blood in the veins of men?
Shopping (music)
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to shop in bulk and at discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least tame their shopping passion a little bit.
But tell me, who would resist just walking around the clothing stores, looking for well-fitting tops and then trying them all (ideally in different colors) in the booth?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a hell of a man.
Just remember how many times you told your boyfriend to wait for you in front of the door...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Do these words remind you of anything?
Isn't that right?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with how they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger the sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of these complaints, the more annoying the women.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless carousel.
Washing windows, vacuuming, wiping the tiles, wiping the dust, rubbing the bathtub - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on a clean tile with a dirty foot, the children for filthy washbasins and glazing the glazed living room wall that you’ve worked so hard to polish?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated, and order and cleanliness should definitely not come first within the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can jeopardize your relationships and family well-being.
Digging
"Throw your used shorts in the trash."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"The wet towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you dig into your partner like this several times a day, know that you can reliably dial him.
Of course, you don’t mean it badly, you want to make sure everything is in order.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to dig into them so much...
Slander, gossip
For some women, there are also slander, gossip, but also insults and association against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will release some kind of harmless gossip or slander in there.
Hands on hearts, it's something that belongs to all women.
But the opposite is the gossip of the thickest grain, which likes and often grumbles, perhaps despises everyone and is especially dangerous for its surroundings - especially within the women's work collective.
Jagr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped to win Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jaromír Jagr took part in the NHL game on Monday with two assists to the Philadelphia 5:3 victory on the Carolina ice and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux benefited from the review of the thirty-nine-year-old star, who added one more pass and was named the best player of the match.
Jagr's teammate Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek also recorded two assists in the match.
Jagr told overseas journalists after the match that he had predicted a big evening for Giroux.
"I told him before the game he'd give the hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get that feeling," Jagr explained, after which Giroux scored the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later, the second strike of the team had a Czech footprint.
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek scored a disc behind the Hurricanes goal and presented it to scoring Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer reduced in weakness, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically, the Giroux.
After working with Jagre, he scored a third goal, then his shot was re-melted by Wayne Simmonds running into the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I'm not saying he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," Jagr said.
"I never thought I'd be playing with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to play me, now it's turning around," Jagr added.
Carolina turned the match into a drama, a goal for Tuom Ruutu, and again Dwyer, who made his way out of the penalty shootout, got the difference of one goal.
Matt Read, who finished the two-to-one re-numbering, did not allow further complications.
"Good shot in our Pronger band."
"He punctured the disc, I picked up speed, and (Read) he drove to the farthest rod."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," he described the last goal of the match from his own perspective.
Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not play against Buffalo, in the second third he resigned due to an injury in the upper body.
Candiens besides the experienced back lost the two-goal lead and lost after a penalty shootout 2:3.
One of their raids was not changed by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec.
Rather than losing points, the home coach was frustrated by the large back row, with only five defenders finishing the match.
"It's bad."
"We played with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Swapping after swapping was on us, and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, pushed the puck out of our band."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defenders, P.K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty hits Winnipeg to the 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
The goals of the Jets, which interrupted the five-match series of losses, were shared by five different shooters.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recreation and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time sold only tours to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned towards the West and the travels of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were consequently very limited.
The great paradox of the era of socialism was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually, even within the framework of socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from that country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand the queue overnight with a sleeping bag or to have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to “politically unreliable people” who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to obtain funds (the Western currency) for a trip to the West.
By far most often, however, the Czechs spent holidays in the country, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs bought, and this custom survives to this day.
The travel of Czechs has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which we no longer realize today, is that it was not possible for us to travel freely to the most popular Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
At the end of the 1990s, the visa waiver to neighboring Western European countries was lifted, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria's Vienna and Germany.
Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there at least for a while.
For example, in Paris, tours of Czechs slept in tent parks, because our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
A typical feature of travel of Czechs at this time was to transport their own food, cans, salami, etc. in order to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convertible Czech koruna, which allowed our tourists to finally freely buy Western currency after many decades.
However, our standard of living, and with it our average wages, rose, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started to regularly prepare trips with charter flights since 1997, which has made it incredibly cheaper for air travel thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, Czechs had visa-free travel to virtually all developed countries of the world, except the USA, which further facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when, due to considerable demand, the first direct charter flight to exotic destinations was launched from the Czech Republic, to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters fly with Czech tourists to warm distant countries every year, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history, they spent more than CZK 15,000 per person on one foreign holiday, including the cost of stay at the place of residence.
The General Assembly is to find a chairman, but again threatens to stalemate
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a chairman and Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek’s successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR) is threatening to be unknown even after the next extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on the electoral procedure to be followed.
Without it, it will not even begin to vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík are interested in leading Czech football.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June and on his departure he called on colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era, football slipped back to the clashes between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
On September 16, a new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly went to the National House in Prague in Smíchov in vain, because the meeting remained blocked and it was not just a way of choice.
There was also no agreement on who has the right to vote at the meeting - whether only statutory representatives or even officials with a power of attorney.
On this one point, there has been a partial agreement since then, which was helped by the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the law, according to which representation on the basis of power of attorney is not possible.
There is still controversy about the electoral system.
The Executive Committee has not made the situation too clear, and in its deliberations, whether ordinary or extraordinary, it does not deal with anything else.
The view of the option has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of FACR, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the proposed model, in the third round, the candidate who receives a higher percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Morava is reportedly willing to make a concession in order to win the candidate who gets a higher sum of the percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side enforces the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds predominance in this percentage census.
"But then it would lose the meaning of the two previous rounds, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept," understands the objections of the Moravian party Svoboda, according to which it would be best not to bend the order and vote according to the current statutes.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the electoral rules determined by the statutes are the most suitable for Pelt of all candidates.
"I wish to vote as much as possible according to the statutes."
"In order not to invent some substitute nonsense like at the last general meeting," said the owner of Viktoria Pilsen, who is running for the first time and in his statements he defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, according to him, the new president will be known and he believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"All passions will be calmed by today's possible progress of the national team in the European Championship."
"Football will again be on a happy wave, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate," says the official from Jablonec, who has the greatest experience in managing football both at the professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divided."
"It's not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations purposefully."
"This may cause the general assembly to be blocked again."
"But I hope common sense wins," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for an agreement by all parties.
Some of the meetings were supposed to take place in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete before the match.
The flight special, in which the vice-presidents Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were supposed to travel to Podgorica, among others, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction and was looking for an alternative option to transport a part of the executive committee to the scene of the barrage retaliation.
Eventually, a ministerial meeting could be crucial, which could be held on Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1> would like to get the divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to agree.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and the upcoming general meeting of the CSTV, which will address the new direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
He is running for president because he doesn’t see a suitable candidate.
If Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík, the head of football players in Pilsen, had seen a strong candidate in front of the extraordinary general meeting who would meet all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), he would not have joined the fight for the top position.
"If there was a good adept, I would fight for him and not go to the polls."
"But in the current situation, no such person has been found," Paclík told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
The fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl motivates Paclík to try to prevent Pelta, the alleged favorite of the elections, from leading the FACR.
Paclík also stresses that if he wins, he would only last until 2013, when a regular general meeting is on the agenda.
In the future, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not very connected with football events.
"I've spoken to some people who might be of interest."
"It was crazy for me when some people said that at the moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Paclík says that now most of all, Pelt’s connection with the president of the Pilsen Regional Football Association, Roman Berber, a man with a controversial reputation, who is known in the backstage as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the votes of delegates at the general meeting, is what bothers him the most.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to have Pelta in the presidency.
"If he wins, the current state of affairs will be preserved and nothing will move forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berber, who is a skilled trader, it would not benefit football any more," Paclík said.
It also suggests that Pelt’s name was mentioned in wiretaps years ago during the investigation of a corruption scandal, from which Pelt came out without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And what would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who also takes a look at his former statement that he would "sell the club of Pilsen if Pelta became president".
If Paclík were to win the election on Thursday, he would be able to imagine a future collaboration with Pelta.
Another candidate Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco, is considering the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team."
"But he couldn't manage the association managerially."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't," said Paclik, who in September aroused great attention by standing behind the dismissal of a panel of arbitrators headed by Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclik says he would dare to run the association.
He refers to his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he has also been the head of Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated the premier league triumph in May.
“I have the power to make a difference in the football environment, to contribute to its specific cultivation.”
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which, for example, tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals committee, which goes as far as disgusting situations," said Paclik, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan boss Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>etínski.
He would also consider one of the priorities the strengthening of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R’s relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"That's one of the key things the new president should be doing."
“If gambling is taxed, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to be straightforward about where the money will go,” he said.
As a burden, Paclik now does not even take his connection with the Pilsen club, although he himself claims that the president of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be "transpartisan".
Pelta is again associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the point in transferring my shares in the Pilsen club to someone hypocritically and returning there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which would exclude electoral deadlock
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for president, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would advocate for the FACR to have new statutes that would definitively exclude disputes over the electoral rules in the future.
Ahead of Thursday’s meeting in Nymburk, the Jablonec functionary is optimistic and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly dampen the possible success of the football team today.
Even before the unrealized election in September, Pelta promised that he intends to focus on representation and raising funds in the event of an election.
He decided to go to the election before the last general meeting at the last minute, so he could use a two-month delay to defend his ideas about football management and present them in a wider context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time for someone to lead the association," says the man, who is associated primarily with the Jablonec club, but who has worked for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
He also believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He believes that behind the current problems with the choice is the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly approved statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they did not allow different interpretations, we had a chairman since September," Pelta said.
It was the revision of the most important document of the civic association that he took as a winch for the delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal task, and I am willing to take personal responsibility if that doesn't work."
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," Pelta says.
They say they are trying not to compete against their opponents.
He has previously announced that he can imagine working with Heinrich Reichl, whom he recognizes for his legal education, and knows that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He did not attack Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík for a long time, who, on the contrary, did not leave the thread dry on Pelta.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, he's had some success."
But his attacks were unworthy, and many people were surprised by the way he campaigned.”
"That's why many of them now doubt his true character," Pelt said of the opponent, who said he remained faithful to the proclamations he had already announced in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
It should be a football showcase.
"And I would also try to end all affairs, starting with the Bohemians or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately afterwards, I would engage in negotiations with the private and state sectors to secure enough money for the entire football," the 46-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his arrival at the helm of football would not mean any personnel cleansing.
"I must first get acquainted with the contents of the individual employees," he said to Strahov, where there was understandable nervousness from the long idleness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk in vain on Thursday.
"If the only issue is how we vote in the third round, we can get over it."
"Football needs credibility, and the only way it will get that credibility is by finally having its leader again," Pelta remains optimistic two days before a potentially decisive day in his official career.
Rajchl promises that under him FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working hard
If the current vice-president Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl were elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the general meeting on Thursday, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will start working hard.
He wants to push for systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by the previous president, Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national teams, professional football, performance football to youth."
"I'm not saying I did everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
“I’m a team player and I want to allocate responsibilities in the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to a specific area.”
"And I'm going to be handing out hard tasks to move football forward a mile in each of these segments."
“A lot of people wouldn’t be happy about it because it would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was considering not to run again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I won't have people behind me throwing sticks under my feet all the time and questioning my every move," he said.
"But a lot of people told me that I shouldn't give up, because then others would give up."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also motivated to continue the work he started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"A lot of work has been done in the last two years, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are processes that will have a repercussion even in a few years, and I do not want anyone to stop them," he said with fears that in the case of the election of the next candidate Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the union could return to the time before the Hague.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's something that I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"Behind him, above all, there are people who would do football in a way that would be only for the chosen ones."
"A lot of things can be blamed on me, but certainly not that I'm sidelined."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also denies that he would be the president of the Czech Republic.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider the fact that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would go to the first league."
"This would not be the current situation when there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
As the chairman of the Pilsen club, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík, is also involved in the fight for the president, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and sees that there are clear achievements behind me," Rajchl said, who considers saving tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating the lottery law as his achievements.
On the contrary, he blames himself for the fact that the union does not pull together.
While he claims that Pelt is "disqualified from returning confidence to Czech football", he considers the second of Paclík's opponents a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he were elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing of the committees."
"He wouldn't want to twist it in his favor," Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jumping into the blue
Julia Stanek
Brushes from Ufon’s view, Budapest’s luxurious swimming pool: Whoever travels through Europe can experience his blue wonder – and after a city tour or a trip let his tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show you where wellness is the most beautiful by the water.
When Iris Meder embarked on a journey of discovery in the past year and a half, her swimsuit could not be missing in her luggage.
Lying flat on the water, she looked up at the artistic domes, swimming opposite the marble putti (the figures of a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her on the edge of the pool and admiring the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a swimming pool, she took it to her notebook in an instant - with remarkable details about the building's construction and history.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the architectural historian Meder and are now presented in her recently published book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing) ": People's Swimming Pools in Munich, the historic swimming pool palaces in the Black Forest,"The Hard Core of Concrete Buildings" in Taunus.
In 13 countries, she was guided by her "Road to the Most Extraordinary Spas in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
With sports it is not too much, says Meder - only in the water it is something different.
The only thing to be angry about is that fan swimmers have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," said Mrs. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles the architecture
Splashing in the jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the well-being factor is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools can be a real pasture for the eyes: "Instead of the floor, a man has a water surface in the spa."
"It's transparent on the one hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building on the other."
Everything visually doubles: a high vault, colorful stove, jumping boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden" provides everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of historical oases of wellness on 190 pages - but above all, it arouses the desire to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by Mrs. Meder, a collector of swimming pools, during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the wonderful healing spas, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Spa in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing water in the original karst cave (cave spa in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, the pools of which are filled with alkaline water and are located in a building in the shape of a terroir.
On the other hand, many outdoor heated swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a wonderful spectacle. While one can see the whole city from the Zurich rooftop swimming pool, one can watch the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of the St. Anton spa - and: In the steam baths there is a window to watch the snow-covered Arlberg.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: the <0xC3><0x96>tztal Aquapark looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
The steam rises from the three upwardly open basins in winter while it rises to the sky against the backdrop of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal Mountain.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool Mrs. Meder's pool collector had the smell of chlorine in her nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rpád spa in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells like fuel oil to such an extent that one can hardly believe that one has got into a spa.
The smell comes from the healing water containing alkaline bicarbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, there was also one place where Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for nice spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luha<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she came across closed terrain.
In 1902 architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovi<0xC4><0x8D> designed the spa was closed in the meantime.
As Mrs. Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau buildings, she saw the weeds growing massively between the tiles.
On the other hand, the disappearance took place in the magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas have already undergone three phases of construction; one can discover not only the Neo-Romanesque elements, which date back to the time of their establishment in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was attached around 1900.
Since its meticulous modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a favorite spa spot for the pool connoisseur Iris Meder, not only because she comes from the Black Forest.
"It's a performance to combine such diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
For such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is apparently a marginal matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank to investigate commodity trading
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank abandoning its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the CEO of the group wants to derive the consequences from this.
Hamburg -
84% of Germans believe it is unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of respondents even demanded that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions step out of the trade as it deepens the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey of Money commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives prices up and banks are therefore complicit in the world hunger problem.
The consumer campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were meant to insure traders against price fluctuations.
Meanwhile, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk trades have detached themselves from supply and demand – and have made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to check the accusations and said that no deal "is not worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank on the line".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the Foodwatch-Report complaints.
The audit is due to be completed by the end of the year and the results will then be presented to the Deutsche Bank board of directors - together with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank officials want to say what the consequences will be.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works self-help on his image.
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but heightened his criticism of the financial industry: “Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks are hurting the general welfare today.”
Let Ackermann, as the supreme banking lobbyist, do his duty.
"Deutsche Bank must delete from its portfolio all items where money is used for betting on food prices," Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann cares about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s outlook seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the company’s boss would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board of directors, otherwise than planned, will not move to the supervisory board.
By deflecting controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about possible losses - his successor should deal with that eventually.
One out of every two would have stopped investing in raw materials.
Foodwatch tries to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Accordingly, just 11 percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that involve betting on food prices.
Many customers of banks would also derive personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: One in two would, as a result of the survey, cancel all investments where money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43% would warn against such a bank, 49% said they would consider terminating their account and switch to another institution.
21st Century House in Vienna
Moved pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and vacant.
It is now being reopened as an exhibition house.
When it comes to modern post-war architecture, bright forms, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is a concise and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and lofty construction of steel and glass.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He became famous for building the pavilion of Austria for the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW Palace plus as the key to a side-building in Munich, he eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
As a temporary exhibition building, the designed pavilion after the World's Fair was placed in the Schweizer Garten near the Südbahnhof (Southern Railway Station) in Vienna, renovated and opened the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - it was named "The House of the 20th Century".
However, the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art received a new booth in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and decaying more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, it is now called "The House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening there will open the Museum Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a graduated art historian with a distinguished career, e.g. in her youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modernity Salzburg, vigorously promoted reconstruction among politicians and conservationists, secured public funds and private sponsorship funds, and determined the use of funds.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the Foundation of the same name, a café and bookstore should be created, and an office building had to be built to do so.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was the ideal cast to perform.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and enlarge the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna with Schwanzer, and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him to see exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it moved to Vienna and changed its use.
There were far greater problems with the current reconstruction: the building was a “catapulte for energy,” says Krischanitz.
The profiles of the glass facade windows were replaced, fiberglass-reinforced insulating glass was used, and the glass roof was replaced with special safety glass.
Cold bridges-steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings sanitized.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a lofty Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish-brown color tone.
And the cinema is still exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the monument office and a low budget.
"Often had to be found material that is good and cheap and also liked the monument office," says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remained flexible and airy.
“It was difficult with the pavilion that came here from Brussels,” said Krischanitz, a typical “Drop-in-the-City-history.”
Such architecture, he said, is “always in the wrong place” and still wants to “awaken proper self-confidence.”
In this case, however, the House of the 21st Century is not in the wrong place, for an urbanistic happy coincidence has occurred: In the circle around the Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City Quarter by the Main Station" with office and residential buildings is being created.
And perhaps there will be another happy coincidence: the house of the 21st century could receive support from another Krischanitz building, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as they say, is already negotiating with the city about the neighborhood at the station in the Schweizer Garten.
The railway plans a package for the winter crisis in the amount of millions
The railroad has drafted a contingency plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the fight against the cold caused by train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn is issuing more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report, referring to the internal plan of the group, that it is expected to invest about 300 million euros by 2015.
It aims to make better use of trains and the rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The goal is to get rid of the platform before the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary switches for operation during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube warned after a summit meeting with government and industry officials of train outages and delays also during this winter.
In the past winter, the track had considerable problems in passenger transport, because, among other things, in difficult weather conditions, it had a lack of reserves.
Thus, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Authority for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the departure of ICE trains
The track has also been unable to cope for years, so ICE train axles must apparently be inspected more often when one of the ICE trains at Cologne Central Station has axle destruction.
Deutsche Bank to pay a million dollar fine in the US
In the wake of the uproar over CEO Josef Ackermann, there are new trade-offs in the U.S.: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions in damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, the industry giant has caught up with its past in the US: The Frankfurt institution pays $145 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106 million) in one settlement procedure to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgages.
The NCUA financial market regulator blames a number of large banks for seducing cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that risks have probably been reduced.
Such papers have lost a lot of value during the crisis and have plunged banks with them into the abyss.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without having to drag the parties to court," a spokesperson for Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank pleads not guilty.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has pledged to pay out $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the accommodatingness of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the U.S. and assists in bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to get compensation for billions of dollars in damages.
Now completed settlements are the first of its kind.
The regulator also clung to other large banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Mortgage-backed Securities are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble collapsed in 2007, it became fatal for a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mindset.
Even though the events took place a few years ago, a sharp wind is now blowing in the face of the banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to seek redress or to find misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
It blames 18 international large banks for the two state-owned U.S. real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac having disadvantaged about $200 billion in mortgage deals.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit by the FHFA, which deals in more than $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurt Institute be held responsible for "substantial losses" without specifying an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requests as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in IBM’s IT business.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
Warren Buffett has always stated that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies will be difficult to predict.
But now he’s read IBM’s business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
Much earlier, he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and acquires computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett’s investment is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, the IBM IT parent rock can now be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett told CNBC that he had bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM did not know anything about his engagement.
He praised the management, which even tried to get proper returns during the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long been betting on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful business computers.
To date, Buffett has avoided tech companies.
He claims that he only invests in companies whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight railroad, the lubricant manufacturer, or the machine manufacturers.
Berkshire Hathaway holds, in addition to about 80 of its own subsidiaries, shares in a number of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Municher Rück.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the most valuable enterprises in the world with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
When Buffett’s investment became known, IBM’s shares rose by one percent before the stock market opened.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, has a total value of more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is considered, along with Apple and Microsoft, the world’s most valuable technology enterprise.
At Microsoft, Buffett wouldn't want to do that.
Bill Gates is said to be a close friend of his.
The threat is tangible.
After the unveiling of the "Zwickau Cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany, the report was responded to with fear and concern.
For for many German Turks, this brings back a ghost that has long been thought to be dead: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against a right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany was never in doubt.
But the rediscovered right-wing extremist network reveals a scale whose dimensions have long since been out of sight.
"Bloody ideology is coming back to life again?" was the headline of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, stressed that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the Constitutional Protection Unit, and feared that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted judiciously: It commemorated the weekend by demonstrating in silence at the Brandenburg Gate for victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, remembered the solemn act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a life together was staged - as a success story.
The headline of an article on the Turkish Internet platform Haber X, which reports on the background of the murder series, is "Germany's Gift to Fifties".
Also, the publication of the newspaper "Hürriyet" for Germany cannot be taken without making this thought connection.
"It's starting to stink," Ahmet Külahci's column headline reads.
It stresses that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
The most critically discussed in German-Turkish Internet forums is the progress of the police and their late success in the search.
Why didn’t the German authorities think much earlier to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many show themselves at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If the activity is carried out here so superficially, there will be nothing left for immigrants but their own defense and armament."
“That would be the best self-defense.”
"On the quality of clarification and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What this means is that if internal peace in Germany is threatened, the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explain.
A photograph of the Solingen incinerator is deeply engraved in the memory of Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the assassinations made the Turkish side more visible to the sense of reciprocity.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at that time was especially critical of the failure of German politics after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, but was replaced at the funeral by his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, in his speech.
It is as if the value of a person is measured by the amount of his taxes.
The current Turkish media coverage shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local state law system is.
In addition to efforts to clarify and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
The scandalous bank at Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered almost bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has been slipping from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now it's up to a German to sort it out.
That's not what Axel Weber thought.
After his noisy departure from the chairmanship of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that he would take on a nearly equally spectacular new job in 2013: the president of the board of directors of Swiss big bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber looked forward publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and made friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has achieved a turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it was clear that everything would turn out completely differently.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and wasted about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, not only a renowned banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
UBS’s board chairman has since also been as scorched – and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he would certainly need time to get involved.
He will then suddenly take responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which just once again proved that it deserves the title of "Bank of the Biggest Scandals in Europe"
Because UBS is huge – until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world – and has been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, the proud Swiss bank will be spared.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid but also cunning asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed on the one hand with $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it has moved into the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich, tells us: “I always referred to UBS as a model of a good bank to my students at the time.”
"From today's point of view, one asks, 'How could I have been so wrong?'
He was very wrong.
In 2007, for the first time, it was clear that something had gone wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli, who was still considered a highly intelligent and also a genius banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, it was clear why he had left.
The bank’s investment division squandered Subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To keep it going, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
On the other hand, it has found real investors, but ones that it would not have been too long ago: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so discreet that one could not even know its name.
But that was just the first blow.
In April 2008 it was worse.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, in 2006 the second best-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster ensued: UBS stood, due to its defective investments during the financial crisis, before collapsing and had to be rescued by the state.
Nationalbank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to obligatory convertible bonds, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken -- for it has noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
“Once again, we couldn’t save UBS,” says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months now, UBS has capitulated in a tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to release data on wealthy customers who, if possible, cut taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay out $780 million - as a refund of undue profits from these transactions, including a penalty surcharge.
In doing so, UBS admitted more or less openly that it helped cut taxes.
At the same time, she has lost what has always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the hallowed light of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it was before.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the President of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, the bank lost credibility over the course of several months in both central business areas: in investment banking due to bad speculation and in asset management to aid tax cuts.
And just as it calmed down a bit, just as UBS was thought to be recovering again, here comes this unfortunate trade anabasis: A single dealer wasted <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 billion before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it’s clear: with risk management in investment banking, it’s probably still not working.
“The Adoboli case seems to have found that risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank also said: “The problem with UBS is that it can’t control risk.”
It was precisely the idea of caution that Swiss bankers had taken long ago to become the guardians of the world's great possessions: no too great risks, but security for money - also from this side the Alpine Republic again collapsed the world.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of unshakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for especially high-quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rental shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry shops such as Tiffany's are among the Swiss traditional shops such as Sprüngli pastry shops.
For centuries, it has been home to Swiss banks: from the National Bank to the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is accessed by a heavy swinging door.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, in front of them are massive leather armchairs, next to the bank's logo a large guide to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has been suppressed or betrayed at times by both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspapers, eventually closing, like all Swiss bankers, also with both big banks.
UBS has probably grown too much, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
The Swiss have nothing to say about it.
"And if they had, they'd adapted to the Anglo-Saxon way."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, bringing it first high profits and then disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
“On Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven-million-strong country decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation,” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book Der UBS-Crash.
As much as 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, were approved by politicians to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of Switzerland’s three major banks merged to form a massive group.
A bank was created that was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and it was still growing.
It helped that the two different banking predecessors of UBS complemented each other: One wealthy but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on asset management and poorer, but internationally more heavily involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came to the advantage of a lot of money with which they could spin a big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, the head of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,” says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble one, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the feeling-driven man around the stomach, who has evolved quite upwards from banking."
But Ospel was said to have relied on Wuffli in the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He probably thought his models were reality," Geiger says.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember executive meetings at which Wuffli, the CEO of the company, repeated the same slogan over and over again: To knock Goldman Sachs down.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She featured "League Tables," a queue that documented the success of the banks of the time.
In it, UBS tried to position itself completely upstairs.
Several steps have already been taken.
In the trade of foreign exchange and shares, she participated in the game completely at the top.
However, the business advisers who were entrusted with the task highlight one weakness: In international interest-rate trading, in the speech of the "Fixed Income" bankers, there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks.
UBS may have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS decided to embark on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank and its hedge fund have invested in Subprime’s U.S. investments.
It evolved into a massive machine that rewrote securities into U.S. mortgages and forwarded them – but also kept the risks to himself.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out.
“In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there,” says bank expert Geiger.
How great is the euphoria, how deep is the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
UBS positions have become a catapult seat and are still swinging to this day.
Whoever runs a big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
They must find a strategy for the bank that all nearby business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: an end to investment banking, a concentration on asset management, a return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far.
But investment banking is set to decline sharply, so much is now clear.
On Thursday, the bank’s new chief executive, Sergio Ermotti, will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only seen as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with its predecessor, Grübel.
In the meantime, he asserted: He is to run UBS’s business for the long term, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
3500 seats will be cut.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to do to make money?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking.
So far, however, he has only publicly said that he will first find an apartment in Zurich with his lady.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market.
The impending recession in Europe has deprived American investors of the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended striking effect.

Businesses were producing 2 percent less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
"We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe may not recover so quickly from the recession, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
Investing legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: He said in a CNBC interview that it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
Therefore, it is probably too early for him to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the decades-old principle and entered the American tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM strengthened the stock exchange rate of the traditional concern and allowed it to first quote almost one percent higher against the trend in the course of trading.

Crows are spreading in cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problem birds": But these highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of cities, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have belonged to the image of the city for centuries, yet in some villages people accumulate complaints about dirt and noise caused by animals.
However, there is still no way to combat the "problem birds".
Field ravens can no longer be driven out of cities, experts said at the first symposium on crows in East Frisian Leer.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible starting points.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
The conservationists also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of especially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is probably destroying the traditional areas for living.
Persecution, increasing build-up, and the cutting down of typical trees to nesting birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are located, among others, in Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project of mass killing of crows in a rural district sparked negative headlines.
Critics have described the capture of animals in bird traps and the slaughter of sticks as particularly brutal.
"Normal banishment, frightening, brings nothing," so found out the urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver of Leer.
Removing nests by splashing water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals are retreating, large colonies are splitting up and splitting up into other places.”
Scare is conceivable only as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
A combination of driving animals out of sensitive residential areas and attracting them to settle elsewhere is conceivable.
The "information board instead of chainsaws" was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One bump in the face can best be overcome with self-confidence in the end."
Mrs. Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg Crow Educational Trail in Schleswig-Holstein, on which information boards provide information about the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Also, Mrs Jürgens had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "Every volume of communication is at stake here, they have a lot to say."
Animal intelligence and dexterity are legendary: Ravens of the field use not only aids to achieve a treat, but even make their instrument as an aid.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior of four field ravens on how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must cause the structure to collapse in order to reach the mole larva.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows had to solve a more difficult problem.
In the vertically built cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with a mole larva.
Birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
However, the researchers put pieces of wire there.
From them all four animals shaped a hook, with the help of which, as a hook, she caught a vessel from the pipe by the holder.
Three of the four field ravens even managed to do so with a sting.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of Bosnians and Turks for the Cup did not work out.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland participate in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have received their final tickets for the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-offs.

Zvjezdan Misimovic, a former Wolfsburg professional from the Bundesliga, scored a penalty (41) and Emir Spahic, a 65-year-old, doubled for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia has already failed in the play-off matches for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a start to peace.
Ronaldo achieved early lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters into the net.
A good quarter-hour later, Nani showed his qualities in long-distance shooting and adjusted the shot from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not act in the first half hour, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edin Dzek.
The former Wolfsburk player from England in the head of standing club Manchester City headed the ball on the bottom edge of the beam, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
In the end, the referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding stood in the center.
After the procedure against Helder Postig in the Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card.
At the opposing side, Stark made a controversial criminal kick after the action of Fabio Coentraa, which Misimovic confidently transformed.
But after the break, the European vice-champion from 2004 clarified everything with four goals.
For the Czech Republic Petr Jiracek finished in the 81st minute also the last doubts.
With this, the 1976 European Champion leaves for the fifth time in a row for the European Championship.
The team of coach Michal Bilko with Bundesliga legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the initial stage.
Goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech prevented Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Sivok's own goalkeeper at the last moment (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the turn from the border of the criminal territory just around <0xC4><0x8C>ech's goal.
After the break, the cross beam had to save the place of the already knocked down goalkeeper of the world class Czechs, again the striker FC Seoul (50.).
Shortly before the conclusion, Branka finally clarified everything.
At that moment, Turkey missed the football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not exceed 0:0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to free up his seat on the third bench at the 2002 World Cup, Croatians can rejoice at their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir’s stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fairytale start.
Selcuk Inan shot only a pole from a distance in the seventh minute, the attacker Kazim also could not hang the bounced ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia took more and more control.
Also, after the break, the Croats did not get a goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who was releasing Ivan Perisic from Dortmund from the 62nd minute, there were also legionaries from the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, Ireland celebrated the first European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who secured a 4–0 win in the first match, to the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiliev (57.) equalized for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
Only at the last moment the Estonian defense prevented a possible leading gate.
But in the 32nd minute, it was a long way off.
After a failed defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball across the line to 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China.
Europe’s largest software maker SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
It is estimated that around $2 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 billion) will flow into 2015, Dax said on Tuesday.
“We will build more R&D facilities and employ relevant staff,” Deputy Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott said at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is now expected to grow from the current 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world's number one in the field of enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s more than 176,000 customers worldwide are in a booming country.
China’s growth plans are also an important building block of Dax’s 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its turnover to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfs earned about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12.5 billion.
Currently, the stores of the software manufacturer, which employs 55,000 employees worldwide, are running as well as almost never before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
“Our goal, supported by extensive research, is to support sustainable growth in China.”
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s new book, Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a list of characters that makes you dizzy.
One piece of advice on how to behave at that moment: Carefully rip this page out and make a bookmark out of it.
You will get to know all of them very well in Mr Englund's novel story, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a kind of beacon - at moments when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in various situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as "antihistorical work".
It contains several very famous names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, as rather a "book about what it was like". It deals mainly with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Sorrow" combines the war experiences of 20 more or less dozen men and women on both sides of the barricade, from female students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and clerks.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flicker like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the entanglement of fate, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classic historical novels.
It corrects the idea that World War I was all about the horrific trench fighting on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skilfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with bee nests falling on them, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids, or struggling with the presence of tse-tse fly.
Almost from the beginning, it was a very touching read.
War devours people’s lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina stinking of gunpowder.
When gunfire erupts in the distance and you are a woman who is home with her children, will you run away or stay?
Who's approaching?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why the whole war was unleashed.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts," said Mr. Englund, "was filled with conjectures, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
Beauty and Sorrow follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from biographies, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound scary and captivating, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details, they are absolutely vivid and believable.
Many of them deal with distress and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Replacements, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It refers to "meat made from pressed rice cooked in sheep fat (and supplemented with a fake bone made of wood), dried root tobacco and dried potato peels, shoes with wooden soles".
There were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American finds inner urges to savagery and brutality, and then declares about the war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature, not sitting in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a good book and pretending that your mask represents civilization."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
“When one finally accepts self-sacrifice, one would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience,” he writes.
Instead, he feels like a “convict who is secretly hanged.”
Other remarks relate to the departure of the old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
“Conflict has increasingly become economic competition and competitive struggle,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captures what he calls “a new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in tailor-made clothes who carries out his bloodshed without getting up from the table.”
People behave completely unexpectedly, meanness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexually transmitted disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving at the front.
“The most grotesque example of this behavior was the sale of gonococcal pus, which soldiers were buying and rubbing on their genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital,” she writes.
"The most desperate people would rub it in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose is quick but not pompous, which fits perfectly with his human theme.
In dozens of small outings, he captures the way the war “unleashed utterly uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I mostly worked with hints rather than complex narratives, such as Paul Fussell's "World War I and Modern Memories" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Peace on the Western Front".
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming ending, which is unparalleled in popular scientific literature.
But I won't tell you.
However, you will feel as if suddenly the author jumped out of the book, ripped the page from your list of heroes from your hand and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake, this time for a minute accurately scheduled raid
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some wearing helmets used in street riots.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because by that time Zuccotti Park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the action except a few high-ranking officers. The others were first told that it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the forefront of the operation, emphasizing how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases from recent weeks, such as the use of pepper sprays against protesters, which violated the rules of the department and, moreover, a wave of public sympathy poured into the side of the squatters, were not allowed to be repeated.
Therefore, the police operation aimed at clearing the Zuccotti Park of protesters was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercises.
Leaders were inspired by operations in other cities.
Massive exercises in case of behavior in crisis situations took place in the part of Randalls Island, which was a preparation for an event in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have stepped up so-called riot-control training — counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers — focusing on the Lower Manhattan district.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally “at the last minute,” said someone to whom the action was originally explained only as an “exercise.”
"I know a few police officers who were also called into the operation, and no one told them they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew that they were going to Zuccotti Park."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was a lesson the city had already learned.
On October 14, the city officials planned to clear the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them crowded into the park before the operation began.
Police officers from various units, including emergency teams from around the country, took part in Tuesday's action -- dozens of police officers who are routinely used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day a large number of people come and go to the park, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the action.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there were as few people as possible in the park," he said.
Before the troops set out, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplifiers.
The lights and the recorded message roaring from the loudspeakers terrified many protesters.
When law enforcement officers entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many of the protesters packed their bags and left.
Police said they didn't touch a tent until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack their bags.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering at the edge of the park so that they could break into it if any arrests were to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police Chief Spokesman Paul J. Browne said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action, and in addition, some police officers treated them rudely.
Mr. Browne claimed that the TV cars on Church Street along the western border of the park could film without any problems.
The police moved westward, tangled in a dense turmoil of protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the sanitary ward, who immediately snatched up everything that was left in the park.
Some of the protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park, and documentary images appeared on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The most obstinate group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some created a blockade and the police began their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp were tied to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to "organizing riots and resisting arrests," he said.
The highest-ranking police officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives in the department, was also personally involved in the operation.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he was not involved in running the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to be summoned.
Barriers were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park.
From these places, the police then developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers were seen, many of whom were equipped with shields, pushing people even further beyond the border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around five o'clock in the morning, a protester south of Pine Street was seen jumping onto the hood of a police car, and several others draining air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for dismissal
Trade unions representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that the layoffs were not necessary and, moreover, discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The court case is probably the last option left to the unions in District Council 37 in their attempt to reverse the dismissal decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s worst-paid employees lost their jobs. Their dismissal was described by the leading union members as retaliation for the city’s failure to allow it access to a health care fund managed by the workforce last spring.
City officials categorically rejected the accusation.
At a city council meeting last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget approved in June.
One of the council members immediately countered that the budget did not specifically mention the redundancies of auxiliary workers.
Representatives of District Council 37 said they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Department of Education that they would sue him. On Wednesday, they will convene a press conference, where they will formally announce the lawsuit before the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiffs will be eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit yet and would not comment on the individual charges.
According to a draft complaint filed by the New York Times, the unions targeted the number of redundancies in the city’s poorer areas to support their allegations of unfairness, arguing that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funding.
They point out that while there were no layoffs at all in schools in Staten Island and only minimally in the Upper East Side, 17 school assistants were lost in Brooklyn, 17 in District 23 in Brownsville, and 46 in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
He recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: "It is not a neighborhood full of movable parents who can procure funds to offset the budget deficit."
Public School 36’s budget was cut by 3.26% this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way bonus funds were calculated for each poor student enrolled.
The unions say, among other things, that high school principals may have been confused by the way the document authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school's payroll to the database of available workers whose salary is paid by the central authority.
“Sixty-six parental coordinators have been fired,” the complaint proposal states, “and not just moved to the database as available staff.”
The mission is over, the Congress is ready to accept the agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
But before that could happen, the revolution had to succeed, the long-running dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of United States troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate the Libyans for their successful uprising and thank U.S. troops for their "statue."
"With this statement, we want to acknowledge the courage of the people of Libya, who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate about Libya has been easy so far.
During the summer, lawmakers on both sides have been constantly arguing with each other and with the White House over the text of a series of statements to approve or reject the United States’ military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain unveiled a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The motion was rejected in the House because of the differing views of the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that the motion was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
This put the US mission in Libya literally in a legislative purgatory – Congress criticized President Obama’s handling of the mission, but apparently did not irritate its members enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The hesitation of Congress was eventually overtaken by other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate is now ready to act.
The Commission on International Relations in its statement "congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable perseverance in their efforts to liberate their people" and "praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their allies who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "reaffirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive the full support of the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators again be split in two, as was the case when the proposal was approved in June?
The last version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the main representative of the Republican Party on the commission.
Mr Lugar's spokesman said Monday he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, pushed by Bob Goodlatte (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on a budget or other topic to be voted on by the entire House or Senate.
The other legislators, despite considerable efforts, have not yet managed to push their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the Constitution that were introduced in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and the Senate - and others are just minor variations of others.
In the House alone, you can find at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment and another handful that would like to “regulate federal spending.”
Some of the proposals are identical, but their proponents — especially aspiring Republicans who want to improve their reputation — can boast of their “authorship.”
The budget regulation decree, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding statement in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss limiting the number of periods in which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods in which he can serve as president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a range of supplements that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The amendment banning same-sex marriage and the amendment banning the burning of the national flag remain a permanent proposal.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in proposing various amendments, they do not deviate significantly from the average in comparison with previous years.
In the 111th Congress, they proposed 77 amendments, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when, according to the Senate Library’s statistics, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current politicians.
The last amendment, the 27th Amendment, was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten, but not defeated," Gifford says in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after being shot at close range by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing along with a melody from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and stating that she was more than happy to return to Congress.
Giffords appeared on ABC News' "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, and it was clear that her sentence writing was still a problem and she needed help walking.
The entire show documented her difficult convalescence, which was necessary because of a bullet wound that pierced her front skull, penetrated her left half of the brain, and came out of her back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special on 20/20, which aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special tracked Gifford's entire recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In the videos Kelly filmed during her first weeks, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, he can’t do more than lift one or two fingers at a time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and therapists teach her how to perform simple activities.
Nodding his head.
Lifting the lips.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within days, Giffords uttered another word, "toast," as she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a pivotal role in Giffords' recovery: the congresswoman sings along with a therapist on the melodies for the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, told Sawyer that she does not remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said Gifford did not read newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six who were killed in the incident were.
Suspect in the shooting is Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held at a Missouri prison where he is awaiting trial under the influence of violent drugs.
"A lot of people have died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Awful, awful, awful."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point, his wife said, "I've lost."
"I told her right away, 'Gabby, you didn't lose,'" Kelly described.
"You just got kicked.
But you can do it, get back together, and come back stronger than ever.”
Military units meet with compassion rather than respect.
The event was a gala on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who have no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of helplessness, frustration, and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines gathered around him.
The crowd stood up in festive attire and applauded enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the military were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who hosted the spring benefit.
In addition to Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of the military units somewhat differently, the chairman of the chiefs of staff also attended the gala.
"They were all presented as some kind of orphan," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know you are.
But what I saw wasn't respect, it was regret.
Such completely opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the often measured, sometimes glorified, American public.
The army is boundlessly encompassed with praise for its sacrifices.
But this praise costs something, the soldiers say.
The public is acting more and more as if they feel sorry for the individual in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive for military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that the troops who had once returned from Vietnam had had to face was much worse.
As a result, most of the words about regret are spoken in silence and in private among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat, where they served as Marines, their father warned them that their service would be viewed from two angles by people outside the army.
From the point of view of some, he will feel respect and amazement, because they defeated the enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
Others will wonder if "there is an evil, violent veteran hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took a place in Washington in the government upon his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him were inconspicuously suggesting whether he could withstand the stress of working in Washington so soon after returning from a fight.
“When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions,” Cancian told his sons.
The military’s concern stems in part from America’s indifference to war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely appreciated in a country that has little awareness of its own military and finds little self-interest in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it used to be during World War II,” said Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
Army faces growing pressure to take tough action against rape
This week, it will be decided whether the trial of 28 women and men against the army for alleged inaction in the case of rape will begin.
If not, they are ready to file a lawsuit against hundreds of other plaintiffs.
Elizabeth Lyman, a first-class soldier, was 25 years old on the night she was allegedly raped by her military colleague and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008, and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego, and after dinner with a friend, she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join him so they could have a drink in her room.
"There was a warning light in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texasan ignored her objections completely.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I could listen to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they walked into her room, a man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the military will wait for the verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will get to court.
The indictment alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, in violation of the military’s constitutional rights.
The indictment was filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time, but over the following months the number rose to 28–25 women and three men, all of whom claimed to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military, and that the army had failed to prosecute him after announcing these arrests.
Burke says she's after the top military commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The military is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to impose measures against such acts?
Burke also says she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of future lawsuits.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the accusations into this case – stacking all the eggs in one basket, as she says – she will file lawsuits in several different cases if it’s necessary to keep up the pressure.
The Defense Department’s defense team is led by U.S. Attorney General Neil MacBride, who, along with his associates, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy - in principle, current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for injuries sustained as members of the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court decree called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs," the document said.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially not allowed to serve in combat, it is only a matter of vocabulary: in modern wars, it is difficult to find a clearly defined frontline.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldiers' teams have played an increasingly prominent role, especially in communicating with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers died between these wars - two-thirds of them directly in combat.
It’s time to modernize the military, Burke explains.
She is not alone in her fight, but three other lawyers deal with the case.
At Yale Law School, attendees of a veteran seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly developing an atmosphere promoting hatred of women.
Independently, the nonprofit U.S. Vietnamese veterans' organization Wosion is collecting evidence for its lawsuit against the military. This lawsuit focuses on diagnosing "personality disorders" that were allegedly found in rape victims so that the army could have an excuse for their release - according to activists' Act B's Anxie People.
Her group had already filed a lawsuit in December against a state-run veterans' organization, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the handling of requests for assistance by people who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress, presented by a group of senators and deputies from both political parties, and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Department of Defense’s Office for the Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Violence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains largely unreported, and according to Pentagon estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
A report released in March also analyzes the level of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military were brought to court -- half as compared to the civilian justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
First-class soldier Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was due to happen.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the tests necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of the assailant was found in her bed - from the wound she had made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing during which she was asked whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify as witnesses to the rumors in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," Lyman says.
"I had a feeling I was going to give birth there - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, 'It wasn't his trial, it was mine.'"
The Lymans ordered a visit to a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, thus declaring her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the army without honor and therefore without the right to a pension.
Whether the Lyman and other prosecutors case moves to the next stage or not, it’s a long run, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington Law University.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next stages of the negotiation."
But between them and the verdict stands the aforementioned doctrine, which has been criticized from the first moment it saw the light of day.
I am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is several decades behind because their duties do not allow to observe the same level of incentives and deterrents.
He adds: “The odds are hard against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
Change will only happen if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not decide in their favor, Burkeva, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other people ready to sue and begin work on other cases related to this topic.
"We will not stop fighting with the military on this issue where there is no reform," he said.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Explore You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man presenting his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous rage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was certainly not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
“We realised it wasn’t really that hard to find them,” said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by a British research team on European digital populism.
The amount of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says, that it was enough for scientists to simply use advertising on the site to identify the demographics they were looking for with absolute accuracy - something that marketing staff have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe, then turned their attention to them and sent them ads. However, instead of using them to invite them to a newly formed group or offer them some dietary products, they encouraged them to fill out a questionnaire about their own future, their relationship to violence and optimism.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are angered by rising immigration rates.
But on the other hand, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen.”
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and policy researchers use this site to study everything from health problems to social trends hiding behind status updates, posts on walls, and pressed “Like” buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides on average three different data per day, which makes this social network literally an "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic papers, in the name of which the word Facebook occurs, has increased from the state five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the ability to study people without having to harass them somewhere on the street.
"It used to be that when you wanted to do a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to the side where they'd never let you go," says Bartlett.
"Facebook breaks all this down - you just go straight to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify a socio-health problem and avoid it.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken outings on Facebook were much more at risk for alcoholism than students who remained silent on the topic.
Moreno suggests that peers of students monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
“The problem can’t be solved if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children that we would otherwise have no chance of discovering."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The information team of the site has compiled statistics on the relationship between the relationship statuses and Valentine's Day, the 2010 election turnout and the nation's satisfaction rate (mainly using the information to which they had access - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make its information treasure available for research and others).
But Facebook users know that the page is following them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, you need to provide the site with your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clear rules on how to collect data offline, but online data is accessible to everyone.
“I don’t think most users would have thought that scientists could look into their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using his students’ public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it that the information was only between them and their friends."
The question of methodology is also to be considered.
Even when researching off-line, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to verify how much of the information on the profile and the posts on the wall are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, believes that the pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool to use in research.
“When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something that can’t be replaced,” she says.
“Social research should be about society and social activities – and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place offline.”
'Cold and inhuman': Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to orchestrating the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter of the "resistance" during his first public court hearing in Oslo.
"I am the military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Knights Templar," he told a court of 500 people.
“I object to the court because you have been mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because they support multiculturalism.”
"I confess my actions, but I admit no guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he “didn’t want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which to express his views.”
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for four weeks, and announced that the authorities would have full control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of being able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was kept tightly locked up.
They all participated in order to move the case to an early closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors told NRK.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I mentally moved a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. When entering and leaving the building without any problems, the journalists present and the survivors looked into his eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge said he was not insane and noted that there was no evidence that he had any accomplices.
It may be comforting to some that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she looked like a monster, but she's not," a relative told one of the victims.
"If I did, everything would be so much easier."
7 Lessons From A Lost Interview With Steve Jobs In A Movie Going To Cinema This Week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, opinions began to emerge from people who compared him to Henry Ford – and elected him for his genius the Greatest Modern Inventor.
Jobs’ recently rediscovered interview, which was dusted for a special film headed to theaters this week, will feature the fact for all Apple fans that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-appointed member of the hippie movement, but also a meticulous organizer and a man who fits every little thing into the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] between a great idea and a great result product is still a long way to go."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show The Triumph of Computer Fools, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than an hour long interview took place.
By that time, it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company NeXT, eagerly anticipating how the general public would accept the Internet.
Only a short portion of Cringely's entire interview was eventually used in the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were said to have been lost in transit.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly edited, that forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which heads to selected theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is notorious for his reluctance to give longer interviews, Jobs is surprisingly excited to be able to talk about his technology philosophy and business strategies.
He also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there is a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you see how Jobs thinks through the answer perfectly to be as concise and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, when he acts impatiently on Cringely’s questions and pushes him to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and it brings up terribly prophetic ideas as Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right and wrong, while offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It’s one thing to read the posthumous reviews of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the heyday of his genius.
He has his own vision of what things could and should look like.
It did not take long, and after he had expressed his ideas, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from The Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
How to learn to run a business:
“Over the years of business, I’ve always asked, ‘Why are you doing this?’ and the answer was always the same: ‘Well, that’s just how it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinking deeply about things related to business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - they often started with the inscription "standard costs", he could only guess about their amount. At that moment, he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the business costs within a moment.
How he made a snapshot of the pope:
Jobs recalls the “Blue Box” he built with Steve Wozniak – a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and make free calls to anywhere in the world.
There has been a lot of talk about the device in the past, but Jobs’s enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as an instrument of power is literally contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a paid phone and switched from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
“At least half a dozen times we’ve been around the world like this, so when we yelled at a pay phone, it came a minute later from the second phone at the door,” Jobs laughs.
“We were young and found that we could build something that could run billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us made a tiny thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never have existed without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a joke he and Wozniak almost made to the end. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, impersonating Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Gradually, high-ranking members of the Catholic Church were summoned to speak to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and only just before they woke up the Pope himself to the phone did the couple giggle and put the phone down.
How he fell in love with technology (and telephoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old and was looking for spare parts to build an odometer, he found Bill Hewlett's number in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had secured a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I was progressing higher and higher in HP, hanging around that computer and starting to write programs for it.
How to innovate:
In several places, Jobs talks during an interview about how he invents new products on the go.
At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a pair of printed circuit boards, one customer asked him to assemble a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalled the problems they faced in developing computer mice:
“I remember when we were arguing quite wildly... yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] until I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer.”
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies are taking their breath away:
Long before he led Apple’s resurrection, Jobs foresaw that many industry leaders would stumble and lose market share in their vision.
"Let's say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are already dominating, so companies are headed by people who are in charge of just that, while people who are in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led the company to its unshakable position is now being replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
This is exactly what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned virtually the entire computer industry.
It could have been 10 times bigger than it is, it could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
Instead of winning, they lost.
How innovation is a form of art:
“There’s still a long way to go between a great idea and a great result product... and as the great idea evolves, it changes and grows.”
During this time, you will learn a lot about him.
You have to make a number of compromises - certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories do not force you to do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind – different concepts – and put them together...
At the end of the day, it’s all about taste — you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a certain way you try to translate them into what you’re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
The Macintosh company was so amazing and successful because the people who worked there were great musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, coincidentally, the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they could do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas were having dinner with opponents of the Healthcare Act while their case was in court.
On a day when the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether to accept an objection to President Obama’s health care bill, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm that will attend the hearing before the court.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the motions.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging a radical overhaul of health care that Congress passed last year — a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the lawsuit, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, the result of which will further fuel the presidential elections scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and try to get the bill rejected will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, which has been defending conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations challenging the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., for which huge funds are at stake.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court debate on the case.
It was attended by, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican supreme representative in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Healthcare Act.
And introducing guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: these two judges have been participating in Federalist Society events for years.
And it is certainly not anything that would be contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are relieved of the obligation to abide by the principles of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
If this were not the case, however, their conduct would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which states that "a judge may participate in events that are currently being held by related and other organizations for the purpose of obtaining funds, but a judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor may he be listed on the agenda of the event."
Still, Scalia and Thomas’s relationship with the two law firms acting in the case, as well as the company with a huge financial interest in the case, was richly enough to alert activists calling for ethics in the government.
“This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to code of conduct runs counter to the assertion by several judges that the Supreme Court follows the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and dined at the community benefit together with the legal representatives who are waiting for their case to be heard in court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines the legs with all claims of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy for their critics, telling them that they also seamlessly combined their judicial duties with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
Conservatives also argue that the ethical issue is mainly up to Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was working as the Attorney General under President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared before the court.
Kagan’s critics are pushing her to relinquish her involvement in the case, saying she fought so much for the law then as to be unbiased now.
Kagan did not indicate that she was going to resign.
Boeing wins record $18 billion jet aircraft contract
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle jets with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it recovers more than $1 billion.
When a company receives an order for 50 pieces of its products, it is usually no reason to celebrate.
But if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the cost of these 50 aircraft is a record $18 billion, that’s something else.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing has announced its largest order in history for a dollar value for commercial aircraft – 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle jets.
The order came from Emirates, an airline based in Dubai.
Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that airlines have the option to buy another 20 aircraft, bringing the total contract value to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes called Dreamliners, that boast significantly better fuel consumption and passenger facilities.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
“This is excellent news for Boeing as a whole,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-producing nations there.
That means they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but the increase in the price of fuel - mostly damaging airlines because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so crucial because the country itself profits from higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or delay aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The order from Emirates strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and narrows the way for Airbus SAS, which has sought to undermine Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus representatives announced that the first flight of its largest aircraft, the A350, which is a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, will be postponed.
The delay was due to customers demanding more aircraft payload and range, so the manufacturer took the time to give the machine more engine power.
The share price of Boeing Co rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister May Have Been Defeated in Michoacán Election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Fausto Vallejon of PRI, was helped in the pursuit of the governor's seat by drug dealers.
Sister Felipe Calderona appears to have lost a violent state election for governor in Michoacán, claiming on Monday that one of her opponents had been helped to win by drug dealers.
The preliminary results were attributed to the leadership in the governorial elections of the western state by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The involvement of members of organised crime in the entire electoral process, and in particular yesterday's course of the elections themselves, is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for the whole of our country," Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the polling group... seized ballot boxes, built roadblocks... and let people vote for the PRI.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost its presidency.
But he is planning an early return to power, and winning the election in Michoacán is an important step in this endeavor.
The party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have beaten Calderona, who was leading the election the day before, only very tightly.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
Silvano Aureolis, the candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now controlled the governor's office, came third. For the divided and unfortunately persecuted party before the presidential election in 2012, it is a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state's capital, Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and urges other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderon, and it was in Michoacán that in December 2006 he launched a military fight against the smugglers.
But the violence persisted.
A PAN mayor, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered just a week before the election, and many of the candidates resigned out of fear.
However, whatever the outcome of the Michoacán election looks like for the PRI party, winning the party will help to gain new momentum.
Enrique Pena Nieto, the party's expected representative in the presidential election, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging in view of the upcoming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has urged India and China to be ready to help bail out the eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall downturn in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of Manila-based ADB, said the two fastest-growing economies in the world must “do everything in their power” to help the monetary bloc recover rapidly through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the Bric countries [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are watching all of Europe’s troubles “too unexcitedly” and said that Asian financial aid, combined with European leadership and funds, would help fuel a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is a good fit," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
For several months now, the European Monetary Association has been severely tested by a serious debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could drag the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge for emerging front-line economies to unite and help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but he noted that mutual assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union Financial Aid Fund, the European Financial Stability Institution - would give greater bargaining power to Asian partners in European countries.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said "India will do what it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from a drop in exports and a drying out of foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we need to maintain a high rate of growth."
“It’s not an alternative, it’s a mere fact, because how else could we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe to India’s 1.2 billion people when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
"One day they might find that Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their holidays on the beaches, which is probably hard to explain," he said.
Lee Howell, director general of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stockpiles should be used to maintain well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis threatens a "dangerous domino effect".
The bank’s forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011 and 2012 now faces a “risk of decline” due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets must develop “plans for unpredictable spending” to protect them from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon Warns of Possible Defense Cuts
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress put under the boiler, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend $450 billion in budget cuts over the next decade, but now fears a further $600 billion if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the entire resort,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said Congress' inability to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called attachment would cause a 23% flat-rate decline and halt many new projects.
"Due to such a huge reduction, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you can not buy only three-quarters of a building or ships. In addition, there could be serious damage to other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
“We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian staff, and since the cuts are due to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements.”
“These changes can shake the faith of those who care for our military and seriously damage its readiness.”
In the end, the cuts will also affect combat units, Panetta said.
"Although the accounts for the financing of possible overseas warfare operations will not be directly affected by this shutdown, operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contract personnel, which will result in delays in negotiated contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"Paid employees will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and the consequent disruption of legal and political support."
The two senators wrote Panetta off ten days ago, asking him for details about the possible impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of the stagnation at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly opposed to this tough measure," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
“The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow.”
It remains to be seen whether Panetta’s letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress to approve the budget and increase votes calling for the Pentagon to be dropped from the list of de-listing areas.
Panetta has been more and more open lately in talks about possible cuts, even though he himself moved into his senior Pentagon position with years of experience passing budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going into a tough fight.
At a press conference held for a minute week, the Minister of Defense gave a brief picture of what his department can expect - a shell of the army, but inside which the core will be missing.
"It will be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without ammunition."
"It'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
“It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained troops to complete the mission,” Panetta said at the start of his Pentagon speech.
"She will be like a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In an appendix delivered with a letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant limitations on landings and deployments around the world; anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects could face completion, including those that are already being tested and those that are just in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the F35, a planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal battleship, and a new ground combat vehicle to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next decade, but its supporters say it is a necessary next step in improving the military, which is needed to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
A quick look at recent headlines shows how serious and ubiquitous lies and deception are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy accusing him of sexually harassing several women -- both sides claim the other is lying.
Penn State University administrators were accused of perjury when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling U.S. President Barack Obama with his microphone down that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie was able to destroy entire careers and engulf the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by publishing information that was immediately disproved by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of misusing campaign funds to try to cover up his extramarital affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that raged around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky.
There's stories of cheating in school and at university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make them look good in their reviews.
Mentors who are supposed to teach the opposite send the message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many frauds do we face?
Studies show that in a single day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first ten minutes of their first meeting.
Determining lies, or “recognition of lies,” is an essential skill that everyone should learn, whether for personal or professional reasons.
However, it is not a social game that is similar to, say, Sharad, when a person shouts: "I have you." Deception recognition is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been disproved.
The liars look you in the eye.
It’s not like they’re stuttering, stuttering, blushing, or stitching.
However, do not assume that it is somehow difficult to spot and expose the liars.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from the sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
I’ve spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from the vast and evolving lie-recognition industry, and it’s clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and can help you a lot in today’s complex world – especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating, or leading people.
Good liars can read others well, let them relax in their vigilance, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more "focused on others" lies - mostly to protect one's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (although the lies they tell are mostly "horrific").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called "initial observation."
Thanks to him, he will later find out what to compare with.
Notice the body posture of the subject, his laughter, work with the voice.
You should know if someone is constantly tapping their feet so as not to unjustifiably accuse them of lying just because they start tapping their feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
Think of it as a warning sign, not a lie.
People who tell a lie may stop moving the upper half of the body when trying to remember their fictional story, they may turn the toes of the shoes to the door, lean towards the exit, significantly change the posture or show "relief after the end of the conversation" - exaggerated relief breathing and changing the position when it is difficult for them to confess
Interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over just to see what the relief will look like after the interview is over.
Look at the language of the subject.
The famous story is that Scott Peterson once quarreled and used the past tense when he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, which launched a nationwide search for her body.
Lying individuals can also express themselves in a measured way: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky," or they will repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal signs are only very minor.
Someone can use a lot of "moderating language" when answering the difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
In such an answer, we do not know too many facts, and often it is another warning signal.
There is no spell to uncover every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills to track down a lie.
With the help of these skills, a person will have a better chance of not encountering a liar and deceiver in his personal and professional life.
Controversial plan to build oil pipeline will be redirected after US government threatens to delay approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico – stirring up unions against each other but reassuring environmentalists – the company in charge of the pipeline announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things could get going again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it will move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the Nebraska government headquarters.
Columnist Alex Pourbax of TransCanada says the company is confident that the construction of the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead to a different route.
The announcement came after the State Department last week said it was delaying a decision to authorize a federal project from which it would not conduct a study of possible alternative routes to avoid hitting the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water reservoir.
"This is really a move forward," Nebraska Republican Rep. Lee Terry told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment commissioned by the foreign ministry would likely postpone any decision until 2013, a year after next year’s elections, but authorities deny that a politician would play any role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
A 1,700-mile-long pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From Alberta, 700,000 barrels of oil flow into Texas’ oil refineries every day.
Six states will have to be crossed this way.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by working squads who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will be created while working on the pipeline.
But lawmakers in Nebraska opposed the plan and were considering introducing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An ongoing environmental impact study commissioned by the State Department found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but an energy industry source said the department’s inspector general had ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two issues.
One was whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represented a conflict of interest in the program.
Next, whether the company that was hired for the original study was not inappropriately selected because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of making the toddler vomit fears
A New York family claims singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan home and scared their daughter into vomiting.
The performance of the singer of the hit "Lady Marmalade" terrified 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car in, Roseanna Monk gathered her luggage down to the lobby of their house on Riverside Boulevard, taking Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby down for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, 'Do you know what your daughter's doing?'
LaBelle rebuked the pregnant woman irritably.
"She said to me in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you think.'"
She became furious and began to speak obscenely, shouting the most obscene expressions out loud...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she started leaking water out of me.
He claims Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
"I said to the woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the mother said.
LaBelle hurled herself at her mother - who still held Genevieve in her arms - and had to be stopped by her escort, who dragged her into the waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
In the meantime, the daughter was screaming so loudly that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter asking LaBelle for an apology, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and spokesperson do not respond to our calls to comment on the whole case.
The lawsuit demands unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took over the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
“The goal is to get Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it's directed at a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of the reign of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and unreliability rose in Sinaloa, foreign investment fell, and with it the economy.
The year 2011 will go down in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, who calls himself a government of change. This government brought with it high expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to unfavorable climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, there was no growth and even a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the growth prospects of the state economy, are responsible for a decrease in economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In the field of agriculture, there was a historical decline of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% was partially damaged. The main crops destroyed include vegetables, maize and peas.
The decline in economic activity up to November caused a constant increase in unemployment in the state by 18 years. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state increased during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 residents of the state of Sinaloa were unemployed, while unemployment increased by 6 years. The unemployment rate in the state increased by 6 years.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the steps that have been taken at the public policy level.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is related to a variety of factors. These include, among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints due to legislation approved by Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally seize dollars to earn them, invest them or use them for something"
Stop the migration
López Cervantes said that the demographic factor is also responsible for the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who go to work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, both because of the difficult entry and also because even if these people get across the border, it is difficult for them to get a job. So people stay and demand work from our state, and unemployment rises," he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state works without paying benefits to the social security administration.
In addition to unemployment and unreliability, other features of the labor market, such as low salaries, are added. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries from all over the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5,352 pesetas by September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with a decline in economic activity and an increase in unemployment, 2011 also saw the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, in the period from January to June, foreign direct investment amounted to $ 630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74% compared to the same amount of $ 5,143,312 in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government of the State lists investments amounting to 17 280 million pesetas per year. These investments were directed mainly to companies in the field of services.
Debt
In connection with the scenario of a decline in the economy, the government of this state asked in July the state Congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended for investments in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2 600 million pesos. Until November, no gains on debt were recorded, and in no sector of the state
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés pointed to the lack of governing skills of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industries, said that in 2011 there was a lack of alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the state government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been really negligible during this year. We need to work intensively to regain the land we lost this year. In 2012, we must redouble our efforts, there was a lack of harmonization of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Hopefully, next year will be much better," he said.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo López said that events such as frosts at the beginning of the year halted the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frost. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore the dynamism that would allow to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. That is why at the end of the year we found ourselves far below the forecasts," he said.
Redefining the Mission
According to Theodor Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed towards more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we observe that work is being done. We believe that a long-term plan should be prepared in which the goals and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The work ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision for a future that better guides the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He said that the current administration has shown progress when it comes to public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that the work done is visible here, and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Convicted of 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of the crime of endangerment of health, namely for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was apprehended by the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 while walking in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer drove in a pick-up van of white color. In the car in the shelf had a black bag and in the passenger seat a small backpack. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the detainee remained available to the Judge of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of Legal Effects of Crimes.
Contributions owed to projects
Social projects that are part of programs such as Hábitat, Rescue of Public Places and 3x1 for migrants face the danger of not being completed or of being long delayed due to lack of economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda said.
The director of urban social development said that while the construction work has progressed so far, there is now a risk that the state government will not be able to secure the relevant supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programs.
He stated that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. Until this time, only the Federation and the city have supplied funds for work, so it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of projects.
"They have to secure almost 12 million and even though the year is coming to an end, we have not gotten anything at all. Even though we were supposed to get a part already in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we have started the projects and are continuing very successfully, but we lack money."
He said that last year under the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padillo, the state did not fulfill the relevant deliveries, and therefore at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan in order to be able to pay more than 7 million, which was not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us already in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. In order to get to the mentioned programs this year, we had to get funds to cover what the state did not finish," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise on the part of state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that a request was sent to Armand Villarreal, the secretary for administration and finance, to expedite the procedure and the corresponding percentages arrived as soon as possible.
"They were going to give us 12 million and even though the year is coming to an end, we haven't even gotten a peso yet."
Court Approves ‘End of Analog Broadcasting’ in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuit filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, which wants to expedite the so-called "off analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. It noted that the necessary eight votes were not found, which would invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree outlining the individual steps that will lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed on the ground that the qualified majority of eight votes needed to enable the court to comment on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the said decree, which thus remains valid, had not been reached.
The draft judgment drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues related to radio and television is a matter that is reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunication Commission (Cofetel), thus violating the principles of hierarchical subordination and exception to the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to fight the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitalization.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the motion filed by the House of Representatives, without entering into a discussion on the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general standards measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is associated with better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that delaying change would mean delaying the benefits of digitalisation, which requires a decision in the public interest, because digitalisation has not only a technical dimension, but also "affects economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the hands of the government of the state".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialized technical bodies at their disposal.
He said it was not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree that to some extent interfered with the powers of Congress, to introduce compliance with laws prepared by the legislative power into the area of administration.
In Michoacán analyze the possibility of adding "voice by voice"
According to the data published by PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the governor's election is less than 27%.
The possibility of a vote-by-vote census appeared in this year's election in Michoacán, where, according to data released by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and this has not yet been counted with the votes of 879 out of a total of 6,074 constituencies.
In this context, the Chairman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures that should harmonize local norms with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not officially confirm his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act against them. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due to expire in this parliamentary term. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted to publish them in a statement issued by the state governor.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature and declared the head of state's vote on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because he has no right to "neither approve nor veto" them.
Asked about the possibility of a "voice-by-voice" census, María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM, it would be possible for the local electoral authority to carry out both a partial and a total census.
In this way, a partial census of one or more electoral packages will be possible under the following conditions: the results of the election do not agree; there is no record of the census and calculation in the relevant field or the President in question does not have it; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, a total recount of votes in all ballot boxes will be possible if there are indications that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the second-placed candidate is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request from a party representative and/or coalition that proposed the second-placed candidate appears at the beginning of the session.
The total recount of votes will also be possible if, after proper counting, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there will be an explicit request from a political party whose candidate ended in second place. In this case, the electoral packages for which partial recounts were made will be discarded.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second places is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total of 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapaliname Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot, Felipe Bacio Cortés, were transported Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown.
According to the family, the colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapaliname Mountains.
After receiving the highest honors along with other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force plane. Family and close friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel at Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell ceremony was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former classmates from the tech high school and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member when he was preparing for graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapaliname Mountains," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the peak of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young and entered the Colegio del Aire Flight School in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always pursued his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he had barely arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan for the graduation of his uncle, so he is convinced that he died while doing what he loved most in life: flying an airplane.
They gave him a last goodbye
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, lieutenant colonel in the studio of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, where in the studio of the Mexican Air Force, the leaders and students of the Saltillo Technological Center, came to give him all the honors.
Bacio Cortés died in recent days after the helicopter he was driving crashed. On board were also the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of Saltillo native Bacio Cortés (incinerated) arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force through a funeral service led by Major Jaime Martinez in the area where his family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, his mother, siblings, and other relatives, students, had gathered in the meantime.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on the Cadereyta NL farm
A few hours before the discovery, military officials introduced to the media 11 people who had been detained in the area for organized crime-related crimes.
The bodies of three men killed by gunfire in different parts of the body and head were found on an abandoned farm in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place on a 1.5-kilometer highway from Cadereyto to Santiago, at the level of an area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cottage with a beige-coffee fence had doors open from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow sports T-shirt and dark cotton pants, and was not wearing shoes. Next to him was also a man in a sports T-shirt with white stripes.
A few meters away was the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three lay face down on the ground.
According to the data obtained at the sites, all three people were probably murdered in another place because the bullets were not found.
Messages addressed by one group of organized crime to the other were found on the fence of the hut, as well as a number of bullet trails, both on the building and on the door.
11 suspects arrested in Cadereyta
The National Defense Secretary introduced 11 people, including teenagers, who were members of a criminal group operating mainly in the Cadereyta area and who are linked to kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burials.
According to the information published in the first attempt on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros, eight people were detained and one detained person was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were seized, and they confirmed they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas."
Another raid took place on 12 November at 6 a.m. Military personnel were on a patrol in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when they noticed a car without a license plate and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they searched and found one rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the area of La Frauda was apprehended on 13 November at about 2 p.m. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burials in the municipalities of General Teran, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to introduce him to the new government that will face the crisis that holds the country over the abyss of economic disaster.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to introduce him to the new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country up against the abyss of economic disaster and that has put the entire euro area in danger.
The presidential palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he could form a government.
It is expected to introduce a government composed of a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that obstacles were being overcome.
"The framework is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, a much shorter time than usual, while Italy struggles to combat the political and financial crisis that has pushed debt levels to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore Italy's broken credibility.
Due to the volatility of the markets, interest on Italian BTP bonds with a ten-year maturity exceeded the 7% threshold, a level where Greece and Ireland had to ask for a rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of Confindustria, Italy’s employers’ organisation, told reporters after meeting Monti: “We said we would be very supportive of this government.”
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this burning situation.
Monti’s hopes for success were greatly multiplied thanks to PDL support for Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign by the crisis on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are destined for good results,” Angelina Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because until now many of its members have opposed the technocratic majority government formed by Monti.
Support to Parliament
The new Monti government must have strong support from parliament to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any hindrance or delay in a given effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could be catastrophic.
Monti opened talks on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organizations.
The round ends on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, who made it possible to move very swiftly in response to the crisis.
After a brief decline at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, interest rates on Italian bonds have returned to a critical level, responding to uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 trillion, would be beyond the scope of the euro area’s current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should stay in power until the next elections, which are scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians will only give him time to carry out reforms and then announce early elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to get Italy out of the difficulties the country has gotten into due to financial pressure.
Political sources said mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to incorporate both political figures into the government.
Spaniards attend international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, 10 will cross the 50-match mark.
On the Costa Rican side, only one out of 22 professional players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rica side when we compare the 22 players from both countries who met today for a friendly at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the champions of the world and Europe, the number one monthly FIFA rating, have a wide range of Class A inter-selection matches on their account, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who is the only one to have played 50 international matches.
He reached this number last Friday during a match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
The Spanish players, who play in the Stars and in the powerful clubs of the English Premier League, maintain an intensive activity over the year in league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches in European cups such as the Champions League.
To the previous one, we must add the experience of the Spanish national team in complicated knockout matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the region. For example, there is Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team has on his account goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (loss 0-1 in London) reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches.
Casillas is set to play against Costa Rica and set a new record for Spain with 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, a key player in Barcelona, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their account, among them the already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke midfielder, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol came close to the 100 with 97 matches.
Followed by Xabi Alonso at 91; Fernando Torres at 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both at 81; Andrés Iniesta at 62; Cesc Fábregas at 61; and David Silva at 53.
On the Costa Rica side and near Michael Uman move left wing Junior Díaz with 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 have surpassed the limit of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With fewer than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are on the list.
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller at 26, Winston Parks at 26, Gabriel Badilla at 25 and Roy Myrie at 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one, and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in its tour to celebrate 20 years of existence
“A trip to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality.”
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We’ve been waiting for over 20 years, but the band itself assures us that for them the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is on tour in South America to celebrate their 20th anniversary and will make a unique stop in Central America on Sunday the 20th.
This day will be played from 7:30 p.m. at the National Stadium with the angel group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from an interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the website of La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans, this is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is also our dream, which is becoming a reality.
We are barely a second time in South and Central America and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation. It's a beautiful country and I hope we can stay here for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring you our music.
I ask, because they literally love the group here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your biggest supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people even refer to the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have come about in a matter of weeks.
We’ve done some great shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that puts us in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing to Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. So we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
Looking at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played here, we have no limits on what we can’t do.
We will try to perform the best possible show with a variety of songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why? Hmm?
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose what songs we’re going to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven’t played in a long time, we focus on them and we’re also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have already forgotten about it.
That makes the show more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of art.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve done?
Yes, I'm sure you do.
First of all, I think that none of us could have imagined that we would be in one big rock band and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years.
We are aware of how much has been given to us and we are touched that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We are fortunate to have the opportunity to visit the places we have always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were a significant part of the emergence of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which the greats themselves are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
Surprisingly, when a movement emerges from a group of friends, it doesn’t happen very often.
From time to time, a group is formed in a city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We are proud of that and we are honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with others.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think, firstly, we're all lucky to still be in this world, and secondly, the fact that we're constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have managed to open musical pathways that give everyone enough freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other’s music, and I don’t think it could have been better.
Your relationship to the word glory has not been easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew, it became easier to find balance.
We try not to go on tour too much because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for the music, you remember that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You must not get carried away by being famous, rock stars. Neither of us ever really cared about this.
What do you think of Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs, and at the beginning it was something spectacular.
As a band we existed for three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at the photos, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I laughed with him, about him, about him, it was always a joy to work with him
He was an incredible person and I miss him so much.
National band Las Robertas will be commissioned to open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you chose them as forerunners?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several designs and we liked this group the most. Therefore, we are curious about what Las Robertas will offer live and they must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influences you as a bass player?
Lots of people.
Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could spend the whole evening talking about bass players that I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge even though it was out of fashion?
I think we've all always felt lightly separated from the word grunge.
When I say grunge, I imagine the bands that I've mentioned like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the other bands that came out at the same time, and if that kind of music is still valid today, it's something great, because it's music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music than ever before.
In the beginning, your music was slightly gloomy, and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
That’s interesting because I feel like there are a few songs on the new album that are lighter to beat, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very gloomy, although they may sound positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and the songs are deeply dark.
I think that when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs are just that for me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss in his lower limbs, his doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is currently under medical control.
MP Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV channel Canal N that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days, where they should find out why he is in pain and why he is losing strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said he believed Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself did not want the pardon because he felt innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and to these problems were added other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving a sentence at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a killing squadron of troops operating illegally during the first years of his reign.
Mujica visits Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, aiming to expand trade between the two nations and touch on political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of a large-scale visit full of meetings with representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on the list of tax havens at a G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that will continue to remain in the position of tax havens will be excluded from the international community, a statement that provoked a negative stance on the part of Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador to this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries. Since January this year, it has had an information exchange agreement with the Latin American country to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concretize fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s "black list" of countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a trade point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
Bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but has never yet appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to all stores around the world this month, was created from the outset to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to wear glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to tell how stereoscopy works without glasses,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, a press officer for Nintendo in Spain, during a presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this medium" because hitherto successful movies like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of pre-existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesperson said that in addition to the fact that the image is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can embark on the "second round" on the levels of the game, which are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome all sorts of challenges and "not succumb to optical deception".
This new Super Mario 3D appearance also presupposes a return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays a note to those who follow the saga and repeats the successful formula from the previous parts. It consists in the fact that the plumber of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in the movements, in the surroundings, in disguises, and also among the enemies, the "playful" Luigi also appears.
Colom Approves Portillo's Extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom said on Tuesday that he has taken steps to extradite former President Alfonso Portillo, who is accused of plotting to launder $70 million in the United States.
This is the end of a process aimed at getting Guatemala to respond to a request from a northern country demanding the extradition of Portillo in order to be able to prosecute him.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered his extradition.
He assured that during his term of office he had “not interfered” in court decisions and allowed all extraditions that came to his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and personal injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move marks a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to lead the trial against the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights have been guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzlement of $120 million by the Department of Defense during his presidency, a process preceded by extradition, but the Department of Public Affairs appealed, bringing the case back into play.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people in a state of emergency
The organization was created to help children without education not to find themselves on the margins of society.
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organization is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped. The organization has been helping them to overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this must be added the long hundred jobs that have been created for this social group.
Yesterday’s anniversary also served to present the balance sheet as part of a ceremonial act that took place in the former production premises of the Fabra i Coats factory and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinij’s organization was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without a job, struggling with drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday’s meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association over the past 25 years.
Various political representations, at the time of the elections, showed the unified nature of the work carried out by Trinij.
Along with Generalitat President Arthur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist education adviser Ernest Maragall and former deputy mayor and current environmental socialist councillor Ricard Goma attended the ceremony.
The current Social Welfare and Family Advisor, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also visited the large hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas said that Trinius was created in a very difficult time and that today also presents a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day is "a good foundation".
The president cited Trini as an example of how one can fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does," he said.
There was a eviction of the occupied house, where gigantic parties were held
Aliens seized 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
Twelve occupants left the house at noon yesterday without resistance.
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors of number 51 on Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally occupying yesterday at noon, where they held gigantic parties that woke up neighbors. They left the building by court order and without police intervention.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the warden said.
The occupiers, who seized 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all electrical and partially water equipment, painted the walls and left trash of all kinds, especially alcoholic beverage cans.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties that lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that while the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque stresses that the occupiers of the building were unfair competition to her, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the discotheque costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment business had to respond to the lawsuits of the neighbors because of the noise. However, the problems were caused not by the visitors of the disco, but by the residents of the occupied house and especially those who participated in the parties organized here, the frequency and intensity of which has increased in recent weeks, according to the angry residents of the neighborhood.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that she even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months she forgave her rent.
Police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbours over the past few weeks.
Alberto Fernández Díaz, chairman of the PP People's Party's City Group at the town hall, last week demanded that "the building be immediately evicted to end the problems of civil coexistence that neighbours are suffering and the destruction of the area".
The chairman of the People's Party explained that only one floor had been seized before the summer, but in recent months, the occupiers had reached all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and in one of them even thefts had occurred.
In this regard, he added that "impunity must be ended and there must be consistency when it comes to acts against civil responsibility that took place in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police reached building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
The park or the mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the announcement of the procedure, which carries more than a controversy about fees
The city's 16-gate competition reopens the debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this municipality printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The leaflet defined the mountain as a large park of the metropolitan city of Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After the CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper boundary of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not orient themselves on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars instead of the Yogi bear.
This was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, records more of the idea of the park.
Either that, or someone's trying to place a gate in the field.
The only question is: Collserola, the park or the mountain?
During the competition, both from the point of view of purely organizational and on the basis of reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is a subject as clear as when two members of this old caste of the elect shake hands when they meet in an elevator.
And it was this achievement that sparked one of the rare convergences between what three Barcelona architects and leading university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is well-founded.
According to Roldán, after the issue of the Gulf Party began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side" as well, so that Ildefonse Cerd's speech on green apples was not finalized.
"We have to start from the principle that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "Gateway to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as demarcations of zones where it is possible to operate".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona, with experience in the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an “intellectual challenge” posing “some dangers”.
The danger stemming from the “uncertainty that the public space project presents today” after the experience of the 1980s, which had its “swan singing” in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"To define something is to take the next step," that is to say, in principle, to go one step further.
“We need to keep in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster.”
If we look at the question in more detail, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserola can be "considered a park", but not the Barcelona part, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also reminded that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserola, which "must not end up in a dump", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his office to intervene in the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but he "doubts" that it should be this very technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds) to create: "Architects should be just tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the game its name is complex because Collserol’s global vision is missing in the tender documents: “There have been 16 tenders announced covering the entire mountain-sea axis, but there is no longitudinal study that looks at the area and understands it as a whole.”
This causes that at least he, applied to all 16 selection procedures.
Otherwise, the design of one gate may encounter the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
In his view, the City Hall should guarantee that the zone immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide a full-length zone of equipment to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino has pardoned Jonas Larrazabal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, Cadino Red granted pardon to Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larrazabal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after Casino Red’s legal representative granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal Court in the district, which was dealing with a blackmail case in which Mayor Monterrey’s brother was charged.
After the Casino Royale assassination, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas was supposed to ask him to pay an economic quota to allow Monterrey City Hall to operate illegally at the betting house.
After the public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office began prosecuting the brother of the panist mayor. On September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours spent in front of Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for Property Crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days after the second detention order was issued and an agent of the Public Ministry denied the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casino Red in the amount of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in a moderately supervised prison because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to remain in the city cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On 25 October, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence had been gathered to prove Jonas's guilt. Among the evidence, for example, the payment of an amount of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the casino in exchange for a promise that the operation would be allowed.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for a pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region. On the basis of this, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During a legal hearing with the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and which of the partners had decided to grant the pardon, but the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain confidential.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, a legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal. In the trial conducted against him, no complaint can be filed. Also, it is not possible to apply for compensation for damages or punishment.
After a hearing with a legal representative at around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanez, arrived at the prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted an official pardon and his case had been postponed to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gave details of the plane crash that killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) said the results of an investigation into the crash that killed government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven others showed the helicopter landed directly on the ground with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, said the pilot had noted before the takeoff that the climatic conditions of the flights allowed.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings entangled in the branches of trees 25 meters from the place where the unit lost its hull."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 people, so it met all the requirements for the transportation of personnel.
In addition, he said that on the basis of the investigation carried out in the impact area, no parts were found on the ground.
"The search revealed that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft collided with the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, it met all the requirements for the carriage of passengers.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that the most important thing at the moment is to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation can take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the moment of impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was moving at cruise speed and the accident occurred on soft ascent terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a normal overflight operation," he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome listed six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in AICM indicate adequate conditions at takeoff, accordingly, the aircraft is moving towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility as far as the Cuernavaca Valley.
The location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the helicopter from the radar match, it is likely that before the impact there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a restricted area:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and sideways.
A sketch of the dispersal of the plane's remnants indicates that the helicopter was intact at the time of the impact on land.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene to suggest that there had been an explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the fieldwork, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain is sloping, the height of the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show images in which there was probably a decay along the aforementioned route.
The information provides elements that seem to suggest that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground at several locations.
After a careful search of the area surrounding the accident, in an area that is larger than the area of demarcation, no remains of the helicopter were found, which reinforces the assumption that the collision occurred in a state when the helicopter was still intact.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has started research on the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research with the aim of discovering the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to detect the gene causing obesity in children and young people. The research entitled "The Genetics of Obesity in Children and Adolescents" will allow to obtain results regarding overweight.
In a report, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Biochemistry Research Unit at the 21st Century National Medical Center Specialized Hospital, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public can also participate in the research, whether they are authorized or not. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centers in Valle de México, where tests for minors will be carried out from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexico) and since October 8, this activity is also carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Center (East of Mexico).
Once the data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to track down risk factors in Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the goal is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on nutrition.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of inherited diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He specified that every Saturday anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference) are made to all participants, blood pressure is measured, the level of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin is determined, and genes are examined (it tries to identify genes that are involved in the development of childhood obesity).
Cruz López said the research reflects health workers’ concerns about the alarming increase in children’s weight.
"Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only boys had a 77% increase in obesity and girls a 47% increase. There was also a dramatic increase in overweight," said an expert from IMSS.
He said that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Native American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes responsible for the onset of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the participants’ direct benefit is that they get an overall assessment of the condition of the children, thereby determining whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He said that even the presence of dark wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetic conditions.
The information is kept confidential, doctors pass it on in writing to the parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent their children from getting sick.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle implying a lack of daily physical activity, sitting all day in front of television and using vehicles instead of walking short distances.
Excess weight is also caused by high calorie intake, that is, more consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic load that is the subject of this research.
There will be no asphalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalts with polymers to create a mixture that has better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature.
If tiles were properly cared for, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 splinters after each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavements were possible, there would be consequences.
In his lecture The Technological Cause of Bursts, delivered in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership was developing modified asphalts with polymers, which should create a mixture with similar characteristics to asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, for example in some cities in the north of the country, thus improving functionality and reducing the formation of ditches.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a large molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others with a low molecular weight, called maltenes. Together, they give the asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic character of asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but varies during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperature, noted a chemical engineering expert.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Mexico City are covered with flexible tiles, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Between the topmost layers there is an asphalt liner, consisting of small stones watered in asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms the liner is watered with asphalt.
When passing cars or creating pressure, it is possible that the forces in the pavement are well distributed.
If it were modified asphalt, it would decompose even better, a chemical engineer believes.
He added that on the asphalt liner is placed the last layer called a shell, formed by fine stone, that is, sand also poured in the asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have a greater mechanical force than the asphalt insert and must ensure friction on the road.
Since it will be subjected to a heavy load as part of the paving, the casing must be of sufficient thickness and care must be taken of the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. In particular, water has a great impact on the functionality of the asphalt liner.
Once the terrain is moist, the water spreads inwards and it is difficult to get out, this causes the softening of all the layers of the tile and thus the formation of burrows.
He explained that during the formation of the burrows, the film of the shell is first damaged and only then the asphalt insert is damaged. However, the damage does not occur in one moment, but it is a gradual process that should be stopped at the first signs with the help of appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load on vehicles is another important factor in the formation of ditches, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tiles must correspond to the load on vehicles and must ensure that this load is not exceeded. Only in this way can we prevent the frequent occurrence of ditches.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that we still have a lot of work to do when it comes to asphalt and the research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow you to easily repair ditches without having to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate lack to become the new Miss Colombia?
The analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle wins the 14th Multi-Miss title.
Valle del Cauca was not crowned Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, winning a silver crown and a sherpa, on the basis of which she became the new first multi-Miss Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's finals in Cartagena, Marenaa B., Marena B., Levera B., Levera B., Levera B. (1990), Marena B.), Aléa B. (1990), Aléa B. (1993), Aléa B. (1993), Aléa B. (1993), Aléa B. (1993), Aléa B.
The question many people ask is, what was missing?
The result is the defeat of the great favorite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has the ability to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain became the Queen of Police and the most beautiful face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved, for example, by Italiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took away the title of Miss.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name her only First Multi-Miss is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?" posed by Martín Murillo Gómez of the literary editors Leamos.
To the candidate's question, she replied:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I believe that this is one of the forms of culturalization. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was "The Little Prince", a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know. And today I have a book with me from Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. It is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer was disliked, both because of the term "culturalize" and because the candidate did not explain what each of the books meant to her.
After the ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise, what is to happen, will happen.
And you people, read if you can. The Little Prince is a wonderful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of favorite.
The Bogotá journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, the most celebrated and the one who took away all the previous awards (Gastronomic Challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother) aroused the envy of other candidates, stressed the Queen, who then collapsed on the scene.
This was evident during the first presentation of the swimsuit on the Hilton beach and during the two parades before the final coronation.
Even though she shone on both of them, it was known that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm shown by the representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for Canal RCN's "As at Home" program, believes that the fact that Melinda won the title of first multi-miss confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not end up leaving with the Queen's Crown.
Moreover, Valle has taken a rather unkind attitude towards the media in recent days and it has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Contest.
Just two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of their country.
"In the Miss Colombia beauty contest, it is not enough, you need to see something more than just physical beauty. You need to focus on social feeling. It is important that the candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and the fibrosis that was noticeable on her buttocks. But this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which elected her Miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls here, "but problems with fibrosis on the buttocks, which in my opinion was not very noticeable, took her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that a native of Valle made a mistake when she underwent several surgeries.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they failed in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit, and here it took its toll.”
Because of this award, which was first given by the National Beauty Assembly, after the swimsuit parade, a cruel prediction came true. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo indulged Melina in not having to give her the highest crown in the end.
Whether this is true or not, it is certain that today Melina began the year of her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named by the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the astonishing success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of a Cali resident who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano.
A fingerprint expert from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, last year, a fingerprint expert from CTI in Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of Farc’s supreme leader: “Alfonse Cana,” by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department this week, one was Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in forensic research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the Chocó City Hall, where he often had to break through the forest for more than five days in order to get to the place where there were corpses that needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital, Valle, and after completing the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, i.e. palms of hands and feet.
In the week of the operation against the aforementioned Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to bring clothes for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
He left for Cauca on Friday night in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to take a card with Guillermo León Sáenz's fingerprints (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the place where the corpse was, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But prints don't lie.
Along with the galton magnifying glass, ink and transplanter, and light, Eliazar began to compare the dactyle records of the corpse with those of the card.
His eyes did not disappoint him: he was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a Puerto Tejada man was commissioned to confirm to the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, whether he really was the supreme commander of the Farc.
Searching for tracks
The recognition given to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the Operations Service against "Cano" is very significant for the dactyloscope from Siín de Cali.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in deciding crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people assist in the investigation of crimes such as theft or murder, and confirm the identity of the persons caught.
When they are caught, many delinquents present false papers or have no papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and search the database.
The investigator said that in the case of injuries, he had to remove a piece of the house wall in the house, because in this place the thief leaned to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not designed to take fingerprints, but in this case we were able to get a full handprint and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts,” he said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicion in the case of murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, it was determined that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and the print on the bottle indeed confirmed it.
Although it is not 100% possible to confirm that he was indeed the murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
The CTI’s fingerprint expert explained that the objects are “wiped off using chemical or physical reactive substances.”
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to collect them.
After that, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registratur.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians out there today whose data is not recorded anywhere,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as it appears in the CSI television program.
Just like everything that glitters is not gold, not everything you touch leaves traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
"Indignation" protests in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
Many of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday as they tried to get back to Manhattan Square, from where they were taken this morning, and then tried to seize another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters crammed into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get, thanks to a court order allowing the "indignated" to return to camp on the site. The second part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying the park in the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through gatherings and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Wall Street Occupy movement.
Bray said the "indignated" response to the eviction, ordered by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself, went as far as the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced eviction of the site and allowing protesters to continue camping there.
In addition, another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the parish site at Trinity Church, also took over the "indignation".
Bray did not know the exact number, but said he had seen some of the journalists handcuffed as well, and that the police had been there for at least an hour.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site, and a delegation of religious leaders has come to express their support and to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed, with a court hearing expected on Tuesday to analyze the legality of the morning evacuation.
Some of the displaced protesters even delivered and distributed copies of the warrants and even gave them to the officers who were guarding the square, triggering "some small clashes," Bray said, denouncing the fact that some police officers had beaten the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the Ocupa Wall Street movement or applying "laws that were published after the seizure began, or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they used previously."
The mayor of Bloomberg told the press that the city had suspended the reopening of public spaces due to the court order and warned protesters that local laws did not allow them to return their tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which up to 200 people were detained and joined because the demonstrators "broke the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the square to be evacuated because it was becoming “a place where people did not go to protest, but to break the law and in some cases to hurt others” because “some shops received threatening letters” and “neighbors were worried about the quality of their lives”.
“The morning clearance was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people,” a spokesman for the movement added, accusing the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
Representatives of the Ocupa Wall Street movement also said they planned to organize "big events" for Thursday in cooperation with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will star in a special Christmas TV show.
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen’s assistant in “Home Improvement,” a lifeguard in “Baywatch,” a bunny in “Playboy,” the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
CTV has announced that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from online domestic pornographic footage, appears with her ex-husband, "Mötley Crüe" motorbike Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a Christmas doll in the manger.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent, recently hosted Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour.
Bublé, a Canadian singer who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "fox" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending the period of decline that began in March
Since March last year, Japan’s economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
The Tokyo government’s initial estimates put the material losses at $300,000 million, a wound that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of decline, GDP between July and September was in such a position that it was possible to turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese tax year starting in March 2012 - predict the highest growth rate compared to the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machines, which are necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, spending fell by 0.9% compared to the January-March period. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy comes solely from the impulse that forces us to use the crisis to get out of it stronger or to rebuild infrastructure, and that is to use the shortage to start from scratch.
Japan has woken up, thanks in particular to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to increased spending on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Yen's stigma
The flows fell into the hands of the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and worrying US forecasts.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota and Sony attributed their weak results in July to the yen exchange rate in September.
While markets continue to besiege the EU’s peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government is cautious.
“We must be wary of the risks that remain, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid rise of the yen,” Economic Policy Secretary Motohisa Furukawa said in a statement.
The prospects are not really encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member states showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, showed that the economy of the major powers is slowing down.
It fell by four-tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The euro area even fell below the average, which is at the level of 100, reaching the level of 99.13 points.
Athens is once again insecure.
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved but Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With swift and risky peripheral guarantees and uncertainty once again in place, Greece is increasingly entangled in a labyrinth leading to an exit from Europe’s great debt crisis.
The assumption that the "agreement" of the new Greek transitional government is due to the demands of Brussels rather than the true convictions of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period he was given at his appointment will likely be short for their application, the chairman of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said the new austerity measures would in no way support it, and reiterated his demand for a new election on the anticipated 19th of February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the summit of 26 October," Papademos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate in a vote of confidence in the government tomorrow.
The package of 24 programmes to promote employment, the reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and the new anti-tax evasion measures will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clear up any doubts about his position: "We have committed to help the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The president of the Conservatives has gone a bit far in his speech to the EU and the IMF to unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, but he has also said he will not support or sign any commitment to implement austerity measures.
Already angered by the impact of Papandreou's games with the referendum, the European Commission stressed yesterday that its demands are insurmountable: it will not unblock any aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties sign a "written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs Spokesman Amadeu Altafay explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" of $8 billion.
So the Greek spinner has a little more to knit about.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain has "achieved a significant global position in terms of microfinance".
Queen Sofia yesterday recalled that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which lies in the fact that "it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is an instrument based on trust in man".
The Queen launched the 5th Global Microloan Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015.
Spain will “continue to work” and expand its network of volunteers “in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly,” Queen Sofia stressed, hoping that the initiatives and the contribution of the summit, which will last until Thursday, “will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women” to whom these loans are intended in particular.
"We have already achieved a lot" and "many challenges still lie ahead".
The micro-loan summit is intended to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that will support the "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to be above the poverty line under which they currently live.
The concept of micro-loans spread to Spain and other countries around the world after “pioneer Muhammad Yunus embarked on this journey,” the Queen said, adding that it was “an act of justice and necessary recognition.”
She described the father of the tool as "an admirable idealist who embarked on a journey to fight poverty". She became acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted on the spot with his loan policy.
This experience was followed by the first global summit in Washington, D.C. and other meetings, such as in Ivory Coast in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to note the constant development," explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned the title of "head of the family" yesterday, which was awarded to her in Valladolid by the "poverty of the poor".
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by inviting participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions to enable the fight against poverty to continue.
"Ethical Imperative"
The foreign minister, Trinidad Jiménez, said solidarity was an "ethical imperative" that all democracies must follow.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with a period of balohobyty, because such cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent "a serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty", and now more than ever, governments in developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, micro-loans are one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept of giving confidence to the people to whom everyone else closes the door. Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the participants in a city that "opens its doors to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
CDU proposes to elect European president on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious difficulties for Chancellor and chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was held in Leipzig on Monday, November 14.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it did not become a question until the autumn, especially to satisfy the party members who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps towards the Italians tomorrow to be lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission, submitted by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1,001 delegates voted against and 10 abstained.
A few minutes of standing ovations at the end of Angela Merkel’s speech and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Chancellor, “the time for change has come.”
This could be reflected in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon, allowing the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area member states, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage "in order to give Europe one face".
This is, in any case, one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: Great Britain opposes it, and CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same stance.
But the direction is set.
Likewise, delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to evaluate each country’s weight on the European Central Bank’s board of directors according to the weight of its economy, which would clearly result in a strengthening of Germany’s weight.
Driven by concerns about calming the climate within her party, the Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but did not try to win Congress by talking about "small" European states or countries in trouble willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud in case of incapacity for work?
After the support, the UMP party and the government launch an offensive against incapacity.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 December, to visit the Social Support Office, where he will deliver a speech on the topic repeated since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
Accompanying this offensive, which is based on the will to implement austerity in a context of increased austerity, but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of incapacity on private sector employees before they start taking sick pay.
Clearly speaking, without the consent of the company, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos, could bring in 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by other measures of symbolic scope: giving civil servants one day of unpaid incapacity for work (until now they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of debate, the right-wing majority also raises the topic of fraud, this time focusing on fraud related to incapacity for work.
"The checks will be much more extensive, and moreover: if you are caught, you will return," Xavier Bertrand said in an interview with RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of notifications seem somewhat disproportionate given the truth about inequities in work incapacity.
These have in fact been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and of political pressures that have been bearing fruit.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Healthcare Research and Documentation, in 2008, daily allowances, with their <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion, accounted for 5% of health care spending.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity allowances and accidents at work and 54% related to incapacity for work, i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
Only 2.5% of healthcare costs.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting group, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which hides some deviations: another survey published in 2007 on the job sites Monster.com showed that 75% of 40,000 French employees surveyed answered that they did not choose a single day of incapacity.
Another study, this time carried out by institutions of sickness insurance, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of incapacity for work was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% lasted longer.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are not more prone to incapacity than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, total absences (for health reasons or not) fluctuated in France between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating on incapacity for work represents only a very small part compared to black work.
When it comes to scams, these are only of a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks aimed at incapacity for more than 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM noted that at 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of the 285,000 carried out due to short-term incapacity were "unauthorized or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked incompetences of more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "non-adjusted or unjustified" were counted to 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases per several million employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than a number that expresses black work.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing in the collection of taxes per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout to rebuild its economy.
On Monday, December 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke before parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his government of unity would not be enough to carry out this task.
"In order to rebuild our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan," the prime minister said in his first public speech Wednesday at the opening of a confidence vote in parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the Euro Summit will be the "main task" of the new government, as the participation of our country in the euro area is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be "around 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Lawmakers reject new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday voiced his support for measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party was not committing to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras said at a meeting with lawmakers for his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on deficit and debt reduction targets and on the fight against waste, but we are against any policy that would hinder the economic recovery.
To Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, says committee of experts
According to a Royal Canadian Society report, Canadians are denied death.
In the case of palliative care, the commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives on the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and make decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of an extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This commission recommends that the government amend the criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this choice appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
In the beginning, experts quote a recent survey by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.”
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this figure is the highest, with 86% of people dying in hospital.
Regarding the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything about the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also checked all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to persons who are incompetent or dissident.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, the co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday during a teleconference more than numerous cases of these blunders precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is also practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Assisted suicide is also done in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” Jocelyn Downie said.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia
Recall that according to a survey conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already voted in favor of euthanasia because they believe that it will allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean sending out the message that the lives of old or disabled people are less valuable.
As for those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
In terms of maintaining or discontinuing patient care, the situation is less clear, the report’s authors say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they propose that it should be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires that medical professionals be educated to respect the obligation to refuse end-of-life treatment without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the case of palliative care, the commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, on the issue of palliative or final attenuation, already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the commission demands that it be considered euthanasia when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Comments from other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations about the findings of the Royal Canadian Society’s expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of experts-signatories of the report as "extreme" because, among other things, it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the final stage.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 years old could ask for help to commit suicide,” said Pierre Deschamps, who reviewed the summary report yesterday.
P. Deschamps also emphasizes that it seems as if the authors of the report put the autonomy of the person above all other values that shape the social fabric of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Margaret Somerville, a medical law specialist, also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a" manifesto for euthanasia ".
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, especially doubts the data of the report regarding the absence of errors in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Resign
Damascus talks about "complexity"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated.
Bashar al-Assad's supporters demonstrated outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who with the support of Russia resists them and talks about a “complot” against his country.
Two days after Syria's suspension of membership in the Arab League, the European Union has stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbors, have taken a stand in favor of President Assad's departure.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II was the first Arab ruler to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “transfer power” in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s military were killed.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a country bordering Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have not been crowned with success.
"Those who in the Middle East do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States rejoiced at the “strengthening consensus against Assad and the dishonest conduct of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly harsh tone" towards repression in Syria, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Toner said.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces were killed in the southern Syrian city of Deraa.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed "in gunfire and concentrated heavy machine gun fire in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country had "set out on a path out of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the League of Arab States' decision to suspend Damascus' membership, which he called a "dangerous step".
Syria “will not bow down,” he added, assuring that “the plots spun against Syria will not succeed.”
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the Arab League is currently considering a "mechanism to protect civilians" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime he says is “paranoid.”
A new special meeting of the League is called for tomorrow in Rabat to take a position on the plan for resolving the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and which envisaged in particular the withdrawal of armies from cities plagued by strife and the release of imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the Arab League’s decision “erroneous,” while China urged Syria to accept a plan to resolve the crisis, but avoided supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
ITALY
Monti demands time and sacrifices from Italians
Italy’s next prime minister, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and start implementing a program that will include “victims” in order to regain the credibility lost in Berlusconi’s last months of rule.
Yesterday, the former European Commissioner discussed with political parties before meeting today with representatives of trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively slender cabinet composed of technocrats who do not belong to parliamentary parties.
“Monti spoke about an important agenda with many victims,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the designed prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti introducing a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti yesterday commented on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked them for time.
In "democracy there are precise deadlines" for the preparation of the government and its program, he stressed, adding that he was "certain that the markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concerns reappeared after the unexpected fall in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The Prime Minister-appointed should form a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politicians" in it.
He expressed confidence that the new government will last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said the new government would have confidence in parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extreme urgency and with the aim of making Italy “again a strong link” to Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The European Union is convinced that Rome, despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, will not achieve its goal of a balanced budget in 2013, and demands new tough measures.
Confindustria chief Emma Marcegagli, who will meet with Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot meet deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, the "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorials, the "challenge to seriousness" and "other Italy", represents for Italy an "epochal change" after 17 years of "Berlusconism".
The big unknown will be the life span of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has until April 2012 to place <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion in government bonds.
Soviet Scientist Helped Iran's Nuclear Program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used for an atomic weapon, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in atomic risks said on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA voiced its “serious concern” about the “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to the IAEA-wide ISIS Institute, Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was supposed to leave the center to set up a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was to work on the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear indications that Iran's development of the detonation system" was "based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one member state has reported to the agency - worked on this technology during a substantial part of his working career within the military nuclear program of his country of origin."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Offences Increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of crimes and offenses against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence declined slightly or increased slightly at the same time.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase compared to a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offenses against Jews and a 14% overall increase in anti-religious crimes and offenses.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offenses rise again,” Human Rights First said in a statement, adding that “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant.”
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hateful criminal acts, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, a senior member of Human Rights Watch.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to tackle these abuses,” he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reports of “hate crime.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence associated with race, color, religion, descent, and now even sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook
Twitter, a microblogging site, introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of its successors, which somewhat resembles its Facebook services.
New "activity" and "name" offers allow you to better and directly know the activities of other people who follow you or whose responses ("tweets") you follow.
This lets you know if they allow you to keep track of posts, whether they sign in to new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
The new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilitaire) faisant le bonheur des initiatives, s'auvre encore a ceu a un public plus grand public plus malieuse u avec
On the web, users immediately in their"tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it takes up a lot of space and it’s too much like Facebook,” writes <0x40>jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter,” <0x40>dannykronstrom tweeted.
Austria-Hungary
The Golden Rule of Equilibrium in the Constitution
The government of the large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria on Tuesday decided to write the "golden rule" of budgetary policy in the constitution to reduce the public deficit and avoid possible downgrades of Austria by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting in a situation where Austrian public debt, with its 74.6%, is high above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion more in interest each year,” said Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and foreign minister.
Austria is thus following up on the request of the Euro Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly requested that, by the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of the balance of the public accounts be recorded in the Constitution or in a law of equal value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and starting in 2017, the federal state’s public structural deficit will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal states, as well as municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty in 2020/21.
Strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in the foreign exchange markets if he were only to continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we find too much volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Y. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to the historical values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars in order to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently broke the record against the dollar valid since 1945.
But only since then has it risen regularly supported by purchases by investors, who see it as a "safe haven" in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and Europe's debt-driven crisis.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen mark, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This flare-up of the Japanese currency is detrimental to the island’s exports, as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues generated by Japanese firms from abroad when converting them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami wave that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, Y. Noda stressed, who fears that this increase in the price of the yen will not kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world’s third-largest economy regained growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in a year, thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and consumption of households burdened by disasters.
But the prime minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect "Japan's national economy".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s vice-governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had previously taken “appropriate measures” suggesting that no additional currency weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities and Exchange Institute increased its purchases of Treasury vouchers by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) and raised the ceiling of the amounts it devotes to purchases of various securities to flood with liquidity to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros).
Euro area:
Rates go up, stock markets fail.
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates of weakened countries continue to rise.
European stock exchanges, still concerned about the stability of the euro area, fell into negative expectations on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 index is losing 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index is down 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“With new tensions around borrowing revenues from euro area countries in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to make only a fraction of recent profits.”
“Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of contagion,” explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker.
The stock market in Tokyo closed with a 0.7% decline, which it suffered due to concerns from market participants about Europe’s ability to cope with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe, and exchanges will only continue in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This relaunch of uncertainty about the future of the euro area is damaging the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570 at a 0.4% retreat.
According to the brokers, the currency backfired after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday providing for the possibility of leaving the eurozone for countries in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian ten-year bonds is 6.85% and the yield of Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of Italy’s future government, Mario Monti, has demanded time on the markets to correct the situation in Italy threatened by poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on October 27 at the Eurozone summit will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in the deliberate line of the markets when the country holds parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historic high.
Anticipating figures for euro area growth
In the third quarter, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% due mainly to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) revised down its figures for the second quarter to a 0.1% decline in GDP instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most worries economists.
For its part, Germany recorded growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first eurozone-wide estimates are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a theme that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that the energy from the core occupies.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental implications of the options proposed are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will cause a doubling of electricity demand by 2050 if we do not want to deprive a significant part of the world’s population of an important part of life.
At the same time, there will be a lack of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity, while not forgetting the essential need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a topic that is currently disappearing from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
But this is not the case in Belgium, which subordinates its decision to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor Switzerland, which it considers right to build only the last generation of power plants.
On the contrary, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue their projects with determination.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by resuming the construction of one power plant that was interrupted after the disaster at Three Mile Island.
If the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts this.
Berlin’s choice will result in higher electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European champion in wind power, from which it consumes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularity, which is why CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are 65% or 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay the electricity bill 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in a globalised economy energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping industry on national territory, French businesses benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful declarations about the re-industrialisation of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they do not fundamentally oppose this energy, as opinion polls show.
Recall that our country’s energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 follow-up jobs.
A strong exporting sector is attracting a large number of SMEs to international markets, creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decides to leave the core, it would sacrifice a considerable number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose the 6 billion euros a year that the country receives for its exports of nuclear facilities and services.
What power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to run for 60 years while its manufacturer’s bankruptcy was planned?
In solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, indeed, that there is no diabolical one.
The development of low-CO2 plants, nuclear plants and renewable energy plants by the French industrial group AREVA demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Nuclear Safety Authority, which exercises uncompromising and transparent oversight over existing nuclear power plants as well as over the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island to have taken place under normal operating conditions, with no human casualties and no environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the concepts of the reactor and the inexcusable human errors caused the drama.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this disaster as it did from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties wishing to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to competitors of the AREVA Group and EDF and would pave the way for them to take a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the overwhelming police, courts and administration subjected to a policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of the "country of human rights" that France boasts of.
Recently, it was an administrative harassment targeting foreign students that became topical when the interior minister (see the May 23 Libération newspaper) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waitresses."
But so far, it has rarely been analysed from an economic angle.
It must be said that there is quite a broad agreement between the left and the right in this area.
To the right, Jacques Chirac stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and to the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of an invasion of hordes of Polish plumbers on French territory was shared to the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity we are willing to provide to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself to banalities when he states that joint development will allow us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be valid in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in their recently published paper, Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.: There is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on employment and employment in countries.
Restricting immigration cripples growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the impacts of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and put pressure on them to cut their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for French employees by doing jobs in underemployment sectors.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where education is insufficient to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Just as the surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants cause the arrivals of immigrants to have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements would lead to a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
Yet it ignores the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries at an average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that one immigrant coming to Germany at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to public budgets during his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed at the beginning of his mandate the desire to go for the missing percentages of growth "with priced teeth".
The aforementioned teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, because despite having invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece during the 20th century.
Some people might have believed that for democracy to triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to make the choice and make it in the most direct way possible.
However, it has already been known from Napoleon that it was the ease of thinking.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become a "instrument of oppression," as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been, and has been, since the beginning of the crises of politics and democracy.
Acknowledging the error of the yes-no Greek referendum in this respect will have the value of a double disclosure: a revelation of the necessity of a great return of political power, but also a revelation of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
There is nothing to gain by demanding a series of national referendums organised as necessary and disorganised.
Bianca exposed to a European absolutist monarch or a leap with tied feet into the emptiness of nationalist depth: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a joint, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not know where to stop the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, bowing to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, that suffers from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
The management of the European project of democratic sovereignty needs to be restored as a matter of urgency.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of the government of the markets and prepare the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will presuppose decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise they would lead us to disaster.
After we have long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is strongly calling for a European economic government.
Be it.
But to think that without stronger political and democratic integration, and being experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" republicans.
A revolution in interests could not be enough.
This lesson continues.
We need to build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building a Europe of more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the world trade fair of chip cards will open in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, phones with a SIM card) to more than 6 billion units.
The most wearable is the segment of contactless technology, which allows you to pay in public transport or make purchases by simply approaching the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to grow further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
After being long in the tow of APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards were issued.
But the big chains work for two.
Carrefour has released 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to achieve a higher gear, banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
“Two large French companies have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their clients in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first stage towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Today, only a small number of devices are equipped with the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology required to carry out transactions.
"They're late."
"But their real expansion is due to take place next year."
“For 2012, we estimate their worldwide sales at 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Crédit Agricole has announced the launch of a test run in Caen from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 iPhone customers and co-workers will be equipped with a contactless payment case.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Societe Generale also announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay with their mobile phones without contact.
Terrorist front stretches from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about ties between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing suspicions that there are links between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had "become certain" of this from now on.
“The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them,” he explained without further elaboration.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French men in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the interconnection bridges.
After being abducted by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their abductors in an operation carried out by French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls made leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long resided in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
“It’s progress, but there’s no doubt we need to wait for more compelling evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active," Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo said.
In recent months, this "support" has become more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or its operational procedures, which henceforth involve human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the challenges posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
A quick success
Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in Haoussa language means "Western education is a sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection is a rapid success.
The sect is being politicized and demands strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while its adherents are starting a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extraordinarily active and multiplied their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government’s response remains the same.
The army encircles the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, is captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has radicalized and left its location in the north.
On Christmas Day 2010, he will carry out an assassination in the city of Jos, killing 80 people, and then another in the capital, Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police headquarters in its first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania via Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security specialists.
Now that al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the Al-Shabaab Somalis are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé said that France was on alert and was ready to "bring all information to the public".
The World According to Presidential Candidates
On issues relating to China, Iran, or aiding Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are outsmarting in simplification and ignorance.
Can a crisis-weakened America govern the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
If you listen to the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating loud statements and brief guidelines on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a Republican stronghold.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or aid to Israel merge with each other.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race to nominate the Republican “Grand Old Party,” has threatened to prosecute the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and accuse them of “manipulation of their currency,” a bearer issue in an America furious with the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Worse still, if this must involve launching a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, nearly stalled on an attitude that “smooths” emotions.
It required a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman, who is in the last place in the election estimates, remains unheard of.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will imprison Iran,” he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to the partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, demonstrates embarrassing ignorance of documents.
Recently, he called for a tough stance against the Chinese military threat, as Beijing "tries to develop nuclear capabilities" - apparently ignorant of the fact that China has had a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
They are all far from the Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy, in 2008.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple thoughts and still won the Cold War.
They remind that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus give him the label of weak.
But the attack is not easy.
The population assesses the national security policy of President Obama, who removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to congestion.
And with the argument that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leading position, Obama is knocking on the right place.
Nord Stream, the new entry port of Russian gas to Europe
The long-distance Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Eastern Europe directly to Russia and runs along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has started to work.
It must supply gas equivalent to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday in the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have jointly turned the control valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will flow to Western Europe each year through the first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is equivalent to the total French consumption.
And it is already recalled the possibility of building a third pipeline of the gas pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction has the character of a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany without being transported by land by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, the two countries are losing a bit of power: the possibility of pushing Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed this most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
That is to say, it is a politically sensitive subject.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained more certainty in its purchases.
But this is at the cost of weakening Europe’s energy, as the project has created rifts between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Just five years ago, Russia succeeded in pursuing its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy, high-gas Western states, whose deposits are coming to an end.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us,” François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating the point at which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The subsea pipeline is made of steel and is fitted with a concrete casing to protect it from the anchors of sea vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction it was necessary to avoid minefields from the period of World War II.
“For security reasons, nearly a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Towers, which on its entire length is not interrupted by valves or maintenance stations.
A control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project managers rejected it when the Swedes were little eager to see the Russian state company permanently settle off their coasts.
"In the event of a malfunction, we stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute," Jens Müller said.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline will leak into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builders, because the welds were designed to leak once every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline is checked from the outside by an underwater robot towed by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is checked by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pushed with gas.
At the end of the three-day journey at a speed of 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information about possible deformations of metal parts.
The long-distance gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish line.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom, which holds a 51% stake, remains in the lead.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is headquartered in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom then leased all of its gas transportation capacities to the company for a five-year contract that could be renewed.
“Gazprom will benefit from the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works should reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment cost rose to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be reimbursed, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline exits from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
The valves are 4.5 meters high and form the gas exit gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 it will be 6 million.
Moleskine - branded notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to once again provide the pleasure of writing.
It brings the scent of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and by its leaves of stale white color as if aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, at that time decided to launch a new design, but differentiated notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, undertakes the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which is used, for example, for surface treatment of benches.
This type of notebook was highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has brought back an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand’s leader at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is far from the secret production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create an artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook will appeal to the businessman as well as the student or professionals.
Moleskine’s notebook image includes that its owners are people cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now has almost 100 employees and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and through the FNAC chain of shops to small boutiques in the heart of towns and cities, where he has been able to assert his identity.
“We followed the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the turbulent development of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also released new records of a notebook reminiscent of a leopard.
Moleskine profits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand is expanding to a wide range of carriers.
A success that aroused envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today's the opening of the 15th Disability Employment Week.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed persons with disabilities is twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is it depressing?
"No, underlines Éric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of the Disabled."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher."
"However, much remains to be done."
It should be said that for the unemployed disabled people, numerous obstacles remain before their entry to work.
These are older people: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a high school diploma and out of 2.3 million university students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very prevalent: 53% for the disabled versus 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that particularly complicate the return to work and that are the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
So much for objective braking.
There are unspoken ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by IMS-Entrepreneurre pour la Cité found that managers surveyed had "poor knowledge of disabled persons" with "excessive knowledge of persons in a wheelchair and mental or mental disabilities".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the 6% disability target set by the 1987 Act.
The last known figures, which date from 2008, indicate a state equal to 2.6%.
“We’re now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization tasked with levying fees on businesses that don’t comply with the law.
The evidence is the number of "fined" businesses, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 guilty businesses to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, put strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What luck"
Before they challenge the French national team (Bleus) on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match will bring them.
We will not go so far as to say that there was an alliance between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after his attacker’s angry gesture in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach only spoke words of praise to his player.
“I am very happy with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country.”
"I want to move forward," the Frenchman assures Lille.
As for the difference between his performance in club matches and the national team matches, "it's the same thing, he apologizes."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Gambling, investigated against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "shin".
The term “joy” cannot be overlooked.
Play against Bleus, whom he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
All the more so because across from them are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami).”
"We crossed right away."
"The power to play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Leekens kindly reminded of "pride".
"Pride" to win"match - holiday".
"Pride" also states in the quality of "neighbors" that France has become a very high-level team again just over a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a great deal of work," he sighed.
Although Belgium will be missed at the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself in a plane with the French in the direction of... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he said.
"We're building something right now, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll be aware of that for the next game." Including against France.
Portugal is very self-confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento opens with great optimism the bargain against Bosnia Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
The Portuguese national football team, which has been at the helm since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
There is only one match left and one opponent - Bosnia.
Aware of Friday's score (0-0) in the hell of Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of advantage, but they were not able to score such a rare goal that would relieve him.
"It's a good result, but there's a risk in it because we didn't score outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of the audience, which should create a boiling boiler there, even if the match definitely seems to be "very balanced", says the optimist, but cleverly thinking Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are quite confident that we can take the lead," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," Carlos Queiroz's successor said.
Friday's tie in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A tie may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but there's a risk in it because we didn't score a goal outside," Bento said.
“We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and players with great individual qualities,” he added.
Just like in Zenici, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start so as not to "give them time to think."
Good idea, provided it proves realistic this time.
