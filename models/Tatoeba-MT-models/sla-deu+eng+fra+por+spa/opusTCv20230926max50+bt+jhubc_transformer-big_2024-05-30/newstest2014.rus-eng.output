In Kineshma and the area, two men committed suicide
Previously, one of the hanged had attempted suicide.
On October 30, around 1-00, in the village of Lugovoe, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
He has previously attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, committed suicide by hanging at his place of residence.
No signs of violent death were found, according to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky".
Is there a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the crumbling highway system, many begin to see the solution in a small black box neatly attached to the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile traveled by a motorist and transmit this information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt to modernize America’s outdated highway financing system undertaken by the planning authorities of Washington and the state.
The usually boring arena of motorway planning has unexpectedly spawned intense debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you’ve driven and perhaps even where you’ve driven them — and then use that information when compiling tax bills.
The tea party is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can’t agree on whether to continue or not, several states aren’t going to wait.
They are reflecting on how over the next decade we can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already taken to testing these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“It’s not an issue we have the right to choose on,” said Hasan Ichrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is making plans to start tracking the miles driven by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
The technology for this already exists.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Highway Construction Fund, financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not been raised in 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even by one cent at high gasoline prices.
“The gasoline tax is simply impossible to keep,” said Lee Mannich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on cars to test the system of erroneous payment.
“This will be the best alternative in the long run,” he said.
The boredom calls it a false user board.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, since with the help of taxes it will be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California are keeping an eye on the system as they develop strategies to meet the targets set by the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
However, House Speaker Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transport Committee, said he, too, sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Adherents of the free market in the fund “Reason” are also delighted that they will make drivers pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that goes into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Reason’s vice president of political affairs.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also backed by two former U.S. transport ministers who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards mispayment.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would involve about 10,000 vehicles.
However, House leaders rejected the proposal because of concerns from rural lawmakers representing voters who often have to travel many miles in everyday life to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are going this route on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are attracted to participate in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state mileage instead of a gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It is being considered in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 East Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can implement these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently fitted with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track their every move.
“Concern about Big Brother and things like that is a big deal,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn’t what people wanted.
When the tests were underway, the American Civil Liberties Union's Nevada office warned on its website: "It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices."
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably be expanded to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of a handful of states that are struggling to find an inexpensive technology that would allow state authorities to keep track of miles traveled by car, but without the information about the place and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society would feel more at ease.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company was not engaged in assistance in collecting state taxes.
It sought to enter the emerging market of a type of auto insurance in which drivers pay on the basis of mileage.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information downloaded periodically via a modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t track their speed and track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a variety of options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can give up the device altogether, deciding instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles all state residents drive.
Elsewhere, they hope to sell the idea to a wary public, forcing devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are looking to develop a taxable device that will also accept parking meter payments, provide “pay as you drive” insurance, and collect a real-time speed data pool from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Automobilists will be attracted to participate in the benefits that will be offered to them,” – said in the document of urban planning.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder if all the talk of mispayment is just a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay Area City Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the trusted Highway Construction Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-off or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid cars and other individuals whose vehicles do not use much gasoline so that they pay their fair share.
“There’s no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take an aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislation and Public Relations Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a host of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
Negotiations are underway with the IMF on a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
At the same time, in addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements about the terms of funding.
He does not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to get help, and the international rating agency S&P, which on Friday lowered the sovereign rating of Ukraine by one step - to "B-" from "B".
However, EU officials say that the IMF can show flexibility in lending conditions, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country’s financial support plan, the EU has a standby option to provide Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which now comes from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from Nord Stream or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia “isolates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reversing deliveries to Ukraine can be used only for a few weeks, and is likely to lead to a decrease in deliveries to other regions.
"There are talks between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources than Russia or from the same source, but on different routes," the source added.
Russia out of the fight to pollute cities with cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most metropolitan areas of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their reconstruction and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
Singapore is a well-known example, where there is a strict quota for the growth of private cars, and the right to purchase them is bought at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times higher than the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced entry fees to the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where only cars with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, also using high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric cars).
Beijing’s Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a “five-year clean air plan” in 2012 worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to Li Kunsheng, director of the Department of Transport Pollution Control of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase the number of private cars to the level of no more than 6 million (currently 5.2 million), as well as increase fuel consumption by no more than 5% per vehicle.
According to the agency, now vehicles in Beijing are responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program are the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the urban measures of the "green five-year plan" include accelerated in comparison with the rest of the country the transition to European fuel standards, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and the labeling of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of cars in the central part of the city, the prohibition on the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentives for electric vehicles).
Beijing's automotive innovations also include a ban on all private cars to move within the fifth transport ring (total of six in the capital of the People's Republic of China) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle license plate), as well as the issuance of registration plates for cars based on the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the Beijing lottery, the third part of the year, the total number of permits for the lottery).
According to the current state program “Environmental protection for 2012-2020”, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011 “mobile sources” accounted for 41% of all pollutant emissions into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In the Russian Federation, they are just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
The Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of HSE Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road trips are obviously unpopular, they can be taken by society only under the condition of their complete universality.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem associated with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences - service and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of the fleet of Moscow).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential development, road surface area and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads twice less than required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking lots, but car storage, not to expand, but to reduce the roadway (so that the streets become more pedestrian-friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the territory of the protected zone of the historical center (a total area of about 3,212 hectares, covering a number of central districts of the city).
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will increase by several times
According to the city authorities, the increase in fines will help to restore order in Vologda and free the streets from elementary tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, and the products they sell often do not pass appropriate sanitation controls.
And this means that the health of Vologjans is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Vologda Administration reports.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks to Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of growing risks to Russia’s main driver of fragile economic growth – consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment of unsecured consumer loans and mass reductions of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is entirely driven by consumption, which almost does not slow down the turnover," said Clemens Grafe, Goldman Sachs chief economist for Russia, presenting the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal growth of wages in Russia is about 10%.
With inflation at 6%, it will be able to meet future consumer demand at about the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is declining, so it is likely that they will be engaged in optimizing personnel costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - explained Mr. Grafe.
Companies are facing a decline in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to layoffs and an increase in unemployment.
Russian business cannot not raise wages, comments the chief economist of Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantiushin.
Unemployment near historical lows, competition for workers is high.
In order to attract employees from the outside or keep current ones, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is supported by the very rapid growth of consumer lending.
According to Mr. Grafe, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplicative effect on the economy of the country.
“We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of demand, money does not diverge across the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments,” the economist said.
But the problem is another - Goldman Sachs expects an increase in arrears on unsecured loans.
They are mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more often," said Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payment of unsecured loans.
The director of the HSE Banking Institute, Vasily Solodkov, is already seeing signs of an impending banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, not having access to cheap resources, such as state banks, were forced to attract funds of the population at high interest rates.
In response, the state banks went on the path of war and began to reduce credit rates, - continues the economist.
Small credit institutions cannot lend at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not abandon dumping, Russia is threatened with a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist considers a forerunner of a mass collapse.
“The state banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was initially not designed for a systemic crisis,” the head of the institute warns.
But the growth of consumption will slow down without a crisis of non-payments, the investment bank believes, due to the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and military, laid down in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, consequently, reducing inflation).
But only partially: if investment does not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this - see the help), the growth of consumption will still slow down, according to Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantyushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is still the fall in oil prices,” he says.
According to him, the Russian economy will begin to shrink at the cost of oil below $ 90 / barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet able to lower interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation decreased, and banks began to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting,” said Clemens Grafe.
The central bank’s interest rate policy does not affect market rates, it only affects interbank lending rates.
“For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes,” said Clemens Grafe.
The money received at the auctions of the Central Bank, banks use not for lending to the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate immediately changes, which means that the funds are trying to go on speculation against the ruble.
"Sooner or later, the Central Bank will realize that this strategy does not work," Grafe said, recalling that the state plans to release the ruble into "free navigation" by the end of 2015.
But you will have to either do it earlier or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he believes.
According to him, the ruble is now artificially overvalued by 10%.
I cut only one way - to weaken, - the expert concludes.
But if the Central Bank plunges into the financiers even a shadow of a doubt that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it can bring down the ruble much stronger.
In Chelyabinsk, the II Congress of the Peoples of the Southern Urals was held.
The forum is dedicated to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive authorities - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening interethnic harmony.
We can set an example here not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
We have no differences and disagreements.
We live in full mutual understanding," says Feofan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust.
During the meeting, a number of issues were discussed, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
At the end of the congress, a resolution was adopted.
The unofficial part of the forum continued at the Opera and Ballet Theater.
An exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Snowden ready to ‘cooperate’ with Germany on U.S. intelligence
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence whistleblower, said he was prepared to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that offer no defense whatsoever.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden said he believes the support of the international community can convince the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have become tense after allegations that the NSA was tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Opperman, a lawmaker who heads a parliamentary group overseeing the intelligence service, said if there is an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness, “without endangering him and destroying relations with the United States completely,” it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not have been able to return to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be there “safe,” the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a “hard and constant” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the world's reaction to "his political remarks."
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials — including in the United States — have found exposing an uncontrolled system of all-encompassing surveillance useful to society.
The letter offers to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge a fee for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though their announcement on Wednesday said passengers would be able to keep the entire bank.
The new hand luggage fee applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if travelers would pay only at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the $100 fee should make passengers take care of paying in advance.
“We don’t want to charge a fee for that,” she said.
Airlines began charging a fee for the first and second bags to be placed in luggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges stuff as much as they can into hand luggage placed in the upper luggage compartments, which is why these compartments often lack space.
Fees are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee wasn't really about making money.
The fact is that Frontier’s most loyal customers claim that finding a place in the upper luggage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the front of a Frontier flight can get the opportunity to carry a bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
O’Malley said the changes to the procedures on the Frontier website and check-in counters are designed to ensure that passengers are aware of the charge before they reach the gate.
The new Frontier Hand Baggage Fee will not start charging until the summer, although a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover air travel costs after years of losses.
However, most of them were not related to hand luggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand luggage fee three years ago, and another discounter, Allegiant Air, later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
According to his December 2011 report, the hand luggage fee brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew a Spirit flight, and he was curious what he would find at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual Spirit baggage charge.
“The landing process was the smoothest I’ve seen in my airline career,” he said.
I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of a fight at the landing gate.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing was swift.”
Frontier also follows Spirit regarding a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said passengers who receive soda or juice can keep the entire jar, and that coffee replenishment will be provided free of charge.
She will still be giving away water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge drinks in 2008, but declined seven months after passengers began complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
The Frontier initiative to charge hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its latest measure to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket vendors, such as Orbitz, between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than contact an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further than anyone else in this area.
In September, it began giving twice as many frequent flyer bonus miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the miles bonus to 25 percent of the trip’s mileage.
For example, a 1,000-mile journey with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would allow you to earn 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming unprofitable.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
NSA blames ‘internal error’, not hackers for website shutdown
The secretive National Security Agency said Friday night that the shutdown of their site for several hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, as the network claimed.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,” the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems reported that the NSA site had been down for at least six hours and the site was still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal secret network was “by no means” hacked.
No classified information is at risk, the official said.
At least one online group of activist hackers said it was responsible for disabling the NSA’s website through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the super-secret NSA, once nicknamed “No Such Agency,” has been in the center of public attention and fierce criticism in recent months after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and at home – all in reaction to secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published by a disappointed former NSA employee.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has sparked rumours that today’s incident was the result of targeted hackers’ actions.
Bombardier’s profits are declining with falling shipments and aircraft orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday, driven by declining orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues at its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also not released any flight test data for its newest CSeries aircraft and has not provided any new information on whether ambitious plans to bring the aircraft into commercial operation by next September will be implemented.
After the first flight of the prototype aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, which raises questions about whether the testing stage is on schedule.
The results did not meet the forecasts and led to a fall in stocks by more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from “above the average market” to “average market” because of the belief that stock growth is limited in the next quarter or two.
“While the decline in aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the transportation department’s profit margins,” Doerxen said in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight testing program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will be more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and first flew in September after several months of delay.
However, firm orders for the CSeries are not too much - 177, as potential buyers wait for the results of flight tests to test the company's claims about fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
In total, there are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Baudouin was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft went into commercial operation.
On Thursday, leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving ahead as planned.
“The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Baudouin said during a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned for the aircraft’s downtime.
All manufacturers plan testing differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for updates, and we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and all the others will follow soon, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical of the announcement that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is assessing the commissioning period and will provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – although apparently consistent with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerxen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same - 9 cents.
Gross income fell slightly – from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected earnings of 10 cents per share and gross revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, down from 57 the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of orders of the aerospace department amounted to $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
“In the aerospace field, the results were in line with our goals, but the small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” Baudouin said.
Gross revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train maker, said gross revenue in the sector grew nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion as of September 30, which is slightly higher than on December 31.
The revenues of the transport unit were negatively affected by problems with the execution of several large contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google’s chief financial officer Patrick Pichett would join the board, fell 8.5 percent to C$4.83 at auction in mid-Thursday.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday.
Sony expects lower annual profits
Japanese electronics manufacturer Sony Corporation, having completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, cut the forecast of profit for the current fiscal year.
Sony’s results from July to September 2013 were more depressing than expected, driven by a drop in demand for the Japanese-made televisions, video cameras and personal computers.
Sony's TV business, which generated its first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years in Q2, fell again to 9.3 billion yen of operating loss in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through tough times, especially due to declining demand for TVs.
And while competitors are eager to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted the focus on industrial components: here, the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially at the expense of automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which ends in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to the agency Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that this figure will be much higher and will be 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month, the start of sales of "smart" watches from the Japanese corporation, endowed with a number of fashionable features that will get rid of the need for 100 times a day to take out of the pocket of the smartphone.
After Sony lowered its annual earnings and revenue forecast, the company's shares lost more than 11% in price at the opening of trades in Tokyo on the morning, falling to the level of 1,668 yen per share.
The speech gene was a stimulator of synapse formation
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein through which the “speech gene” Foxp2 performs its function, stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the website of the journal you can read its summary.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists found that family members had impaired the work of the gene Foxp2, but how it performs its function, remained unknown.
In the new study, biologists have shown that at least part of its functions Foxp2 performs as a stimulator of the formation of new synapses in the brain area associated with the formation of speech.
This is done by another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, with only its activity shimmering Foxp2.
That SRPX2 really affects vocalization, the scientists confirmed in an experiment on mice.
When the animals’ gene activity was artificially reduced, they shouted less when separated from their mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the emitted sounds was restored.
Previously, mice were also shown to be associated with the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals who were injected with a human copy of the gene whistled more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, consequently, the SRPX2 controlled by it is related to purely "mechanical" properties of sound formation or more subtle processes.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned the head of a criminal group about a police investigation is imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta transferred information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared exposing his secret drug addiction was jailed for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta has been handing out classified information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough about his investigation into drug trafficking activities after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and nicknamed a "cool lawyer" among criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to spy on Scarborough, whom he had previously represented in a drug-related trial.
Officers noticed Scarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at his lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was having dinner with his colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta “regularly used” a Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on his credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted to obtain illegal information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after police seized <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine in a series of raids, as well as more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash.
42-year-old Ditta passed information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors, a law firm based in Blackburn, was embarrassed today at Liverpool’s Royal Court after pleading guilty to two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool’s Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine in a previous trial.
The lawyer’s exposure came after police investigating Scarborough’s activities found that he had regularly spoken to Ditta on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked down the suspect and found him approaching Ditt’s home in Blackburn and putting 60 percent pure drugs in a black golf glove under a lawyer’s garbage can.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough repeatedly called Ditt, who was having dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court learned that Ditta “regularly used” cocaine after tests found traces of Class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “lawyer’s secret.”
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and he also had a hair sample taken.
In questioning the police, he said that in addition to the workplace, he had a home office, and clients came to his home on legal matters.
However, the court became aware that after important arrests, he called the largest participants in drug trafficking, a number of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell what the detectives knew about them.
In her indictment speech, Ann White said, “If anyone knows they shouldn’t be breaking the law, it’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta was accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he had entered into too close a relationship with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly prove to be legitimate, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but disgraced it.
He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and allowed to doubt his disinterest.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not and wanted to pass the information on to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta turned from a criminal lawyer to a criminal as soon as he started acquiring drugs from members of organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the targets of the main actors of criminal groups, who entrusted him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind his profession.
The investigation into Mr. Ditt was conducted by the Lancashire Specially Dangerous Organized Crime Unit, which had already obtained a conviction for three cases of cocaine possession, and now for obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire for a just punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer conversation in which he says that the job of his dreams is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the ideal companion for him at dinner is Mohammed Ali, and motivation at work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22,000 spectators, police officers who attended today's meeting of the KDC of the Russian Federation said.
The ticket program is overstated, in their opinion, about twice.
During the match of the 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia with "Spartak" was involved only a thousand stewards with a regular norm of nine thousand.
Spartak fans were entitled to 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, by agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5,000 tickets.
This data was announced by the head of the KDC Arthur Grigoryanets.
The Americans listened to Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, a U.S. intelligence official, who chose not to disclose his name, said the U.S. was eavesdropping on the phone conversations of senior Japanese officials.
This person confirmed that in the land of the rising sun there are several points intended for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this happened during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects for intelligence activities, NHK reported.
Officially, none of the parties has yet commented on this information.
We will remind, the news about the surveillance of the US special services for the Chancellor of Germany appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA may have tapped Merkel’s phone for the past decade.
The Chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her wiretapping very painfully.
She said that the allies, which she believes have been Germany and the United States for decades, such surveillance of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details about the wiretapping of Angela Merkel’s phone conversations with German prosecutors.
The German specially flew to Moscow to meet with a former CIA employee.
Bashkiria may put grain to auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria in the course of public procurement interventions can put grain to auction not earlier than the beginning of 2014, believes the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolay Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
While the price in the market is higher, there is demand.
“Perhaps the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year,” he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that this year the crops for the 2013 harvest amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
550 thousand hectares were sown for the 2014 harvest (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
Increased areas for winter wheat and triticale, rye remained at the same level.
In the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no group "Brotherly Circle", which in the United States included Leps
In the databases of the Russian security forces of the group “Brotherly circle”, to which Washington included the singer Grigory Leps, is not included.
As noted by “Interfax” in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media appeared reports about the inclusion of the US Treasury Grigory Leps in the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate “Brotherly Circle”, all databases were checked, but such a group was not found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian mafia”, which allegedly operates abroad, according to law enforcement agencies.
"Even in the very name, 'Brotherly Circle', there is some element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret lodge.
"It's all very similar to a PR action," the agency's interlocutor said.
On October 31, the US Treasury Department announced the inclusion in its checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brotherly Circle" of Artur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov.
The individuals on the list are suspected of links to some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and are on the US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the US authorities, Grigory Leps “serves as a courier to deliver money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev.”
The production center of Grigory Leps refused to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them “delusions”.
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama listed the Brotherhood Circle syndicate as a “substantial transnational organized crime group” and instructed the Treasury Department to “undermine and ban their global criminal operations.”
Putting a person on the blacklist of the U.S. Treasury entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with people living in the United States.
The scandalous video was sent to the police.
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless tricks, caught on crack smoking.
Police in the Canadian city said they had the video footage and were ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
Information that authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto police website.
The head of local law enforcement, Bill Blair, held a press conference on the matter.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the footage with the public, but he vouched for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by security guards in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the existence of this video has already been written by the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor has not commented on this.
He just says he's not guilty of anything and he's not going to resign.
The video is evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend of Ford, Alexander Lisey, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, obtaining illegal income, as well as criminal conspiracy.
At times, Lissy served as the driver of Rob Ford.
The city has long demanded the resignation of its mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public drunk, allowed himself racist and sexist statements.
OJSC "Rostovaeroinvest" recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the choice of the generic designer of the facility.
The amount of the contract at Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the press service of OJSC, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, according to the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent for state examination in the spring of 2014.

At the first stage of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50 thousand square meters, in the future it may be increased.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
By the time of summing up the results of the tender, the architectural concept of the Yuzhny airport complex was defined, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects.

A politician in Turkey has declared a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began the construction of a dividing wall in the area of the city of Nusaybin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PMD party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin, located on the border with Syria, Ayse Gekhan, declared a hunger strike, protesting the construction of a dividing wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti reported in the press service of the Party of Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
Police have repeatedly dispersed protest demonstrations.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammer Güler first denied the fact of the construction, then said that the wall is being built to ensure border security.
“The mayor of Nusaybin, Ayshe Gekhan, a member of the PMD, went on a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle,” the party said in a statement.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds crossed this border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhuman situation that the Kurds will never agree to," party officials quoted Ayse Gekhan as saying.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is planned for November 7 in Nusaybin.
Venezuela sets exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency - the bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on November 1, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange the equivalent of ten thousand US dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the country’s purchased bolivars at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
On the black market, however, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela amounted to almost 50 percent.
Oil Minister and Vice President of Economy Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolívar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to depreciate the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of restraining the prices of goods and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of overregulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to shortages of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Director of Ugra Andrey Belmach noted that it is still difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so I am not ready to say how long it will take to find a new coach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I want to find not just a coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and will achieve certain results with him.
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
"This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: what can prevent the Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?" the newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said the new media judiciary "will always be biased as it is an extension of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
“I hope that the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him with a request to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the government to “take the media deadly,” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have been hit hard,” and criticized the bill as “draconian.”
The bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media have sparked the authorities’ anger by broadcasting surveillance footage where troops who were sent to the site of the attack are reportedly looting an expensive shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimayo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official for questioning, though the summons was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists up to one million with an additional risk of being "excluded from the lists", i.e. to be banned from receiving official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations.”
She also said the measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s so-called “resilient blogosphere.”
Politicians understand that by shutting down the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“Nobody will ever know,” Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrent and balancing forces in public life.
“Left to themselves, politicians will devastate the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts appointed by the National Wage Commission and restore their huge, tax-exempt salary of about 532,000 shillings a month — one of the highest in the world.
In the communal payments of Voronezh residents, a new line of expenses will appear - deductions for major repairs of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-bedroom apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact norm will be determined by the government of the region.
But when to paint the entrance, put in order staircases or even replace the elevator - the tenants themselves will decide.
This law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, it is necessary to put in order - to establish the order of the capremont of houses, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, or somewhere else, this will be the establishment of state control over the spending of funds that residents collect for the repair of apartment buildings."
Under the control of the state now and share construction.
The law protecting against fraudsters is approved by the Duma in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people suffered from dishonest developers.
The problems of the majority have been solved.
By the way, the new law stipulates the rights and obligations for all participants of shared construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that abuses have also begun in this area, due to the fact that in 1998 the shareholders were the same, and in the 2000s the same shareholders."
People began to make money from it to cover the loophole, including passing these two laws.
It was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens subject to deportation near Voronezh.
The regional parliament passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
The problems of illegal migrants in the region are at least attenuated.
So, last year, just over 100,000 foreigners entered the migration register.
But only one in five issued an official work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, the chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They violated the law, but they are not criminals."
There are no ships, and they must be deported - they must be kept somewhere.
The federation decided to equip such places with regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is defined - this is the Old Olshanka of Semiluk district.
Well, and finally, the regional parliament gave new benefits to large parents.
First, families raising 5 or more children are completely exempt from transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but large parents save the same.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt 3 or more children, from the new year will be given housing subsidies.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30 thousand per meter.
A family, for example, of 6 people - dad, mother, native child and the third - adopted.
For them, according to the standards, the state acquires housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West microdistrict is quite an acceptable option.
Well, in the district center for this amount you can buy a whole cottage.
Baumgertner nominated to the board of directors of Uralkali
The current board of directors of OJSC "Uralkali" proposed the candidacy of the arrested in Minsk Director General Vladislav Baumgertner to the new composition of the board, according to the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner entered the list of 11 people nominated to the new board of directors.
This list was prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on November 29, at which the new composition of the Board of Directors will be determined by a vote.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
When he was arrested in August this year, he was charged with abuse of power.
However, later, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko said at a press conference that Baumgertner’s accusations were re-qualified as “theft”.
The goalkeeper of “Petrochemist” Matt Dalton refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the post of mentor of the Nizhnekamians.
The goalkeeper believes that the acting head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys great authority from the players and will cope with their responsibilities.
Recall that today "Neftekhimik" dismissed Krikunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov," Dalton told RIA Novosti.
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will cope with the obligations imposed on him - I have no doubt about this.
In the team, he enjoys great authority, this young specialist definitely has a great future.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the next match of the Italian championship against Parma.

According to experts, these measures can bring to the budget an additional 619.3 billion rubles.

U.S. Secretary of State: intelligence agencies sometimes “go too far” when collecting data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that while collecting data and wiretapping, American intelligence services sometimes "go too far", however, the politician noted that the information appeared in the media about wiretapping 70 million people is not true.
I assure you that innocent people were not harmed in this process, but there was an attempt to gather information.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was illegal.
I recognize this, as the president does ... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future," he said.
Italian workers with experience give way to young ones
Italy's unemployment is breaking records.
Data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country’s population is now without work.
Things have not been so bad since the Second World War.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 is unemployed.
According to the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already being carried out by the country’s largest energy company, and the adopted laws allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement for workers with seniority.
However, on the other hand, Italy is facing the common problem of an aging population for Europe.
And economists are not sure that the initiative with premature rotation of personnel will justify itself.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year, the capital authorities promise to equip more and more transport and transfer hubs (TPU).
By 2020, it is planned to put into operation 255 TPU.
What the project actually turns out to be, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence appeared at the metro station "Smolenskaya" of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.
The inscription said that the transport and transfer hub was being arranged.
All this was very strange, since no land transport stops near Smolensk and, consequently, it is impossible to transfer to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop at the Garden Ring, you must overcome about 130 meters, including the ground crossing through Karmanytsky Lane.
Now, Smolensk is almost finished.
The flower stand disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced with paving stones.
That's the whole transport junction.
Transport and transfer nodes are flat and capital, - explained in the press service of the Metropolitan Department of Transport.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
A flat involves the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of commercial facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
In fact, flat TPUs are not even engaged in transport workers, but professional landscapers from the department of capital repairs of the city of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex construction, - explains the director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes it is enough to have a roof over your head and a display that indicates the time of arrival of transport.
For example, the Yasenevo metro recently opened a fully-fledged flat transfer hub.
Without canopies, but with intercepting parking lots and signs indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in pursuit of the number, officials record everything in TPU no matter what they get.
Back in 2011, the municipality planned to build all about 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now in the plans until 2020 there are as many as 255 TPU.
A hundred and fifty of them promise to pass this year.
Although the city has a program for the development of TPU, no qualitative criteria are indicated, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".
They report on the number of objects, but the quality of transplants on each of them often deteriorates.
According to the expert, there should be two criteria: firstly - reducing the transplant time, and secondly - convenience.
First of all, the opportunity to change the mode of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, when arranging a TPU, sometimes it turns out exactly the opposite.
A vivid example of the VDNH metro.
Previously, commuter buses from the Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their stops were moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to Kosmonavtov Street.
Farther from the metro, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential buildings.
The residents did not want the bus station under the windows and complained to all possible instances.
With capital TPU in Moscow somehow did not immediately.
The first of them began to build five years ago near the metro "Planernaya".
The project was meant to be exemplary.
And it really turned out a sample of how the transfer hub, given to investors, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are platforms for buses, a canopy so as not to go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
However, the Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in Moscow TPU were not given a place in principle.
They were like strangers pushed away from the subway.
There is more room for trade.
Only clothes 32 stores, and in general there is almost everything - from pets to the car showroom.
What if one of the bus passengers needs to buy a new car on the way?
When we build a capital TPU, for some reason we always get a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion, when part of the parking lot decided to put on the market.
Now on the third floor of TPU "Planernaya" among the marked on the floor parking spaces is a fierce trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards, angrily looking at our photographer.
The transfer node has finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that earlier the metro "Planernaya" had a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the merchants were spared and allowed to the interception parking of the transfer node.
Because of the high prices, it is always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build a new flatbed TPU in its place.
That's rocking.
The metro "Kaluzhskaya" distance from the metro lobby to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you need to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to go around it in the open air.
However, the designs on the "Plane" and "Kaluga" will soon appear flowers.
In mid-September, the city and land commission of the city hall approved planning solutions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground levels.
The main monster will grow near the Tushino metro, it will have 418,7 thousand square meters of area.
Representatives of the Directorate of Railway Stations of the Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of the TPU near the metro, have already told journalists: in future high-rise buildings there will be shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials say that the multi-tiered parking lots of rabbits are from a third to half of the area.
Take, for example, the “people’s” garages.
For example, the garage for 258 cars, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
So, for a parking lot for 2.6 thousand cars at "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" will need about 80 thousand "squares".
That's less than a third of the mahina they're going to build there.
Have one or two floors go to all sorts of bus platforms.
At least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate remain.
And this is, for a minute, almost two gums.
If the capital TPU at stations and stations are built by railway workers, then the rest of the sites will be mastered by metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities", including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, the property department of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft resolution according to which investors will be able to apply for obtaining a plot for TPU directly to officials.
Without any competition.
Transportation is a priority for the city.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or the Spadina station in Toronto, Alexander Morozov is sure.
There trolleybuses and trams go underground to the subway level and the access distance from the subway car to the tram is only 50 meters without access to the street.
There is no extra trade around.
But Moscow officials are thrown to extremes.
Either we don't build anything, or we're going to build 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Socialist-Revolutionary Party proposes to equate extremism with insulting patriotic feelings
In order to protect citizens’ patriotic feelings against provocations and insults against Russia, Fair Russia proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremist activities and punish them with five years in prison.
According to the newspaper "Izvestia", such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the deputy chairman of the Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent for an opinion to the Supreme Court and the government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, a responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, domestic legislation has sanctions for abuse of formal signs of state power - the flag and coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be hurt by insulting state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, has not been sufficiently worked out in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the discussions that take place annually on the eve of Victory Day, when some media figures allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real bacchanalia takes place every year.
Practicing wit and an "alternative view" of history, some publicists come to the argument that, they say, it is a pity that the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the nation’s main “spiritual fixture,” Mikheev said.
In addition, according to Mikheev, there are much more patriotic people in Russia than religious ones, but the law punishes insulting the feelings of believers, and insulting patriotic feelings can be almost with impunity.
According to the MP, it is necessary to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremist activity and to prescribe in Article 282 of the Criminal Code the appropriate punishment.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from 100,000 fines to 5 years in prison.
The earthquake of magnitude 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, in the area of the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, reports Reuters.
The focus of the earthquake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers south-west of the city, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said on its website.
The tremors were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 in Moscow).
No casualties or earthquake-induced destruction have been reported so far.
Chile is located in one of the most seismic areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of various strengths are not uncommon there.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
Then the earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and the tsunami caused by it led to the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in recent history occurred in Chile: in 1960, the magnitude of 9.5 was recorded there.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of the natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can have no doubt that the case will be considered in compliance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
“We can guarantee compliance with the law,” Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizanne, like the rest of the activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
"I asked whether we can expect a humanitarian gesture towards the detained citizen," Mr. Ayrault told RIA Novosti.
“Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to violate the law,” Medvedev said.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects "like a powder keg", and recalled what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, reports RIA Novosti.
UN Announces New Goals to End Poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the 2015 MDGs before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro on the night before.
They were included in the final version of the document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that now is the time to “become above national interests”.
“I am pleased that UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating the universal Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to use the authority given to me by Member States to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which is based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the top-down statue of Zamora Machel, Mozambique’s founding president, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to chant peace slogans at one of the rare demonstrations.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt adorned with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital’s Independence Square.
Within two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo — some of the most violent clashes since the ceasefire was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that was supported first by the white Rhodesian authorities and then by the apartheid-era South African government as part of an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, as the opening of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, a leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party have accused each other of creating tensions.
The Renamo Party claims the government was the instigator of the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamó bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Fernando Mazanga, a spokesman for Renamó, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gebusa has tried to dispel fears of instability.
Gebouza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama felt like a “loser” who wanted to use “everything left of his power to try to prove that he can impose his own decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after reports that Mazanga had announced Renameau's withdrawal from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he was referring to Frelimo's non-compliance with the agreement.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions that have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) colliding with their foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
Neither of them is a good negotiator and neither is willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which is trying to push for electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to gain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in this election.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who was due to step down next year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key north-south highway.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended railroad use for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railroad.
Mazanga was evasive when asked whether Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo party wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has exacerbated dissatisfaction with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent increase in kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and they need to find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuan, a participant in the demonstration, said people simply wanted stability.
“No one cares about Renam or Frelimo, they just want peace to be restored, they want free access to the roads,” he said.
A series of premiere film screenings "Art-mainstream" will be held in Moscow
A series of screenings of "Art mainstream", where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held in the cinema "Rolan" from November 1 to 5, RIA "Novosti" with reference to the organizers of the project.
The program will open the "Art mainstream" French comedy director and actress Reim Kerici "Paris at any cost".
This is the story of a model working in the French capital, Maya (Kerici herself), who is deported to her homeland - Morocco due to visa problems.
In addition to the film, the audience will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-duk "Mobius", melodramatic biopic Oliver Hirshbigel "Diana: a love story" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film of the May Cannes Film Festival "The Life of Abdel".
The only Russian participant of the “Art mainstream” will be the winner of the festival “Kinotavr” Alexander Veledinsky’s film “Geographer Globe Drunk” based on the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming loser-teacher Victor Sluzhkin - in the film was played by Konstantin Khabensky, whose work was also marked by the prize "Kinotavr".
Children should learn myths and legends as “lifestyle models,” the author says.
The Torah stories could show that “rough power cannot defeat subtle cunning,” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths would prove “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to teach in schools,” Crossley-Holland advocates “a careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America myth and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I was in favour of introducing them to a 20-year curriculum.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “reflects interest” in children, and the main ideas are “sublimated” into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote a collection of Norwegian myths for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said, "You may have intentions, of course, but you'd better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly articulated.
The old principle: show, not tell.
In the Voronezh region detained a football fan who broke a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o'clock in the evening on October 29 at the station Gryazi-Voronezh transport police officers removed from the passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of the favorite team, the guys on the way arranged a drunken debosh on the train.
The young people were taken to the duty section of the line police department at the Gryazi station for the preparation of a protocol on an administrative offense.
There, fans repented of their anti-social behavior.
The police issued administrative material for them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station station began to wait for his arrival.
In the middle of the first night, fans left the train station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, unexpectedly returned and broke the window of the front door in the waiting room of the station.
At the bell of the broken glass rushed an officer of the transport police and a security guard of the RZD.
They managed to apprehend the attacker who tried to escape from the scene.
Employees of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are being checked.
The issue of initiating a criminal case is being resolved, said Sergey Olhovik, senior officer of the direction of information and public relations of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport.
Vitaly Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we went back 15 years.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the riots in the stands during the match of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I am a supporter of the fact that the organizers of sports events are responsible for all this: clubs, the league, the RFS.
But we see that they have taken a different position.
They are waiting for someone from the outside to come and put things in order.
This is a very good position, but not quite right.
We need to organize the fans, clubs should invite their stewards, and not let the business run its course.
We have now developed a special government decree on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will address this issue closely.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read the interview with Leonid Fedun.
State, let the law go fast.
It feels like the Bayern fans came to Yaroslavl and arranged it all.
We are outside observers.
It's awful to see a stand being watered from a fireplace.
And this is in a country that is preparing for the World Cup.
“I feel like we’re back 10-15 years ago,” Mutko said.
Snowden could be interrogated in Russia
Former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden is unlikely to travel outside Russia to testify in cases of wiretapping by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
According to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the American can answer the questions of representatives of the Prosecutor General’s office of Germany in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden’s departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by the allies of the United States," the source said.
"At the same time, in principle, the Prosecutor General's Office of the Federal Republic of Germany could send representatives to the Russian Federation or hand over written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, the member of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Ströbele said that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of wiretapping by the US intelligence services of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
An ex-CIA officer has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the US NSA blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival,” he told Euronews TV channel.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of the source of "Interfax", said that his client can cooperate with the German investigators, but when and how - will decide for himself.
Edward Snowden, a U.S. citizen who worked for the National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information about the secret operations of the U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was cancelled by the US authorities, who in absentia made serious charges against him, and until early August remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport.
On August 1, Snowden received a document on granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and on the same day left Sheremetyevo.
Yesterday, the lawyer of the American Anatoly Kucherena said that his client got a job in a “large Russian company”.
The NSA’s surveillance of Angela Merkel was reported by German media last week.
According to journalists, the phone conversations of the chancellor, the Americans began to listen back in 2002.
The tracking station was reportedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
German authorities after the publication of this information said that the surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarev has left “Fair Russia”
State Duma deputy from the party “Fair Russia”, a member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev filed a statement about the withdrawal from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he submitted the application to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev left the ranks of the "just crosses".
We sit, we drink tea...
"For some reason, many want to see the picture "Ilya Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table", but there is nothing so epochal about it," the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the Socialist-Revolutionaries.
Meanwhile, from the mandate of the deputy of the State Duma Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to refuse.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and by law cannot leave it.
Messages about Ilya Ponomarev’s intention to leave the party “Fair Russia” appeared on October 30.
It was reported that together with him from the "SR" will leave Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of concluding a peace treaty
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to openly exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kishida said at the meeting.
The Japanese Foreign Minister recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and acquired a bilateral character.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will meet Japan in resolving complex political issues, RIA Novosti reports.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, Tokyo today holds protests demanding the return of the country lost after the Second World War.
In the Japanese capital, cars are driving, from which the loudspeaker says: "Return the northern territories!".
The police are not stopping the protesters, they are making sure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It is safe to say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a century ago, pop artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conferencer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Fay's innovation over time was picked up by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolinas stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at the Carolinas and then got more success, reached a level where they’re already too famous to play at the club,” said Hirsch.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as "Standup for Heroes" - an annual music-comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where they will appear, among others, Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Cowbers and Roger Bill Waters.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy also expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year have gained popularity in an unconventional way, for example, thanks to shows on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became famous for his role in a comedy series on a little-known cable channel (especially the sneaky "League" on FXX on the theme of fantasy football), and now leads his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate starred in both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation Areas, although she is best known for the series of viral videos Marseille is a shell in boots.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with a distinctive style (surrealist pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, cunning, focused on racial themes Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be the interview of David Steinberg with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director on television and in film, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is certainly a central element of all Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks down some alley between two houses and thinks, “Well, if I’m left with no money at all, maybe I’ll live here.”
Pakistani authorities start talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the embassy of this country in the UK, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif is visiting.
The Pakistani Prime Minister made a statement on talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister has announced that dialogue with the Taliban has begun," the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
"He said that he hopes and prays that the dialogue will work in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan," the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the eponymous Afghan movement, but operate independently of it in the northwestern areas of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic state.
Islamabad’s government had previously tried to start talks with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to engage in dialogue.
It said it would negotiate only if the authorities moved troops stationed in Taliban-held areas to permanent locations and released detained Islamists from prisons.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
The price of oil fell to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as alarms over the formation of large reserves eclipsed a message indicating that China’s energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining momentum.
The U.S. standard grade of oil in December fell by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel for late morning European time in electronic trading on the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which in total amounted to a fall in the price for October by 5.8 percent.
Rich oil reserves have influenced its value in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. stockpiles had increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, the reserves were replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports about the Chinese industry, demonstrating a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China’s economic recovery may continue to gain momentum after the third-quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 percent after a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, the international benchmark used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
The head coach of “Colorado” Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the goalkeeper Semyon Varlamov from the first minutes of Friday’s match with “Dallas”, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, transfers from Dallas child “SE” Natalia Shmelev.
“What are we waiting for?” said Rua after the morning rolling of the Lavin.
Of course, what happened worries us all, but we are confident in it and feel that it will be useful for him to go out on the ice today.
We want him to come out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you are absolutely sure that the situation did not affect the condition of the goalkeeper?
We'll see today.
Our players will undoubtedly support Varley by helping him guard the goal, as they did in previous games this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until this situation is resolved by the court.
In Siberia, you should not be vegan: greenhouse tomato will not replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, found out the correspondent of RIA Novosti.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they can not endure the winter without health losses, and no greenhouse tomatoes do not compensate them, according to Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors surveyed on the eve of the Day of Vegan.
Drink oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists are sure that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict norms in nutrition, at least, is not good for health.
Complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate with vegetables.
It is necessary to include in the diet at least milk or eggs, "- is sure nutritionist Marina Bogai.
She cites the example of fish containing essential fatty acid Omega-3.
The richest vegetable oil is linseed oil.
"To consume it in the necessary quantities for a person, you need to drink liters!" - says the nutritionist.
Doctors believe that the residents of Siberia should pay special attention to the diet in the winter.
In this season, vegetarianism is especially questioned.
In the context of our realities, there are high demands on food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased calorie.
"If a person restricts himself on animal products, respectively, this caloric content, he is under-receiving," - says the specialist.
The nutritionist Olga Pozniak agrees with this.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the answer.
It is better for a person to eat mainly products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is set up for better assimilation and digestion of these products.
And in winter, people do not want to bite a cucumber, but a hot soup or something more hearty,” the doctor explains his position.
According to her, from what vegans can eat, various cereals, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples left in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this is definitely not enough for proper nutrition.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians have a sufficient level of vitamins in their bodies only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and in May there is snow, is not advisable.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat," the doctor states.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need building materials, including in the form of amino acids.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them defective.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins and trace elements in the menu.
“Vegans don’t get them,” God says.
Arifulina says that an adult person is free to choose anything, "to play the toys that he wants."
He has an already formed organism, skeleton, organs.
Children should still be fully fed.
If parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
“The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow,” she says.
All the medical experts surveyed agree on the low quality of winter-grown greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses, contains less microelements we need than (grown) in open ground.
"The quality of the products is not that," says Bogai.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest more crops damages the quality.
“Apples don’t turn brown on the slice, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and moldy, tomatoes are tasteless and tasteless,” the medics cited the examples, adding that they are most likely stuffed with excess fertilizer.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
With this I do not agree with the laboratory of the Siberian Physical and Technical Institute of Agrarian Problems, the candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all the norms and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If they try to expel more than one square meter, then, of course, watering will become more frequent, and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there is too much nitrogen fertilizer, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened,” she explains, adding that the question of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.
The court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of “stop-and-search” in the New York Department of police
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeals suspended enforcement of a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's "stop-and-run" program and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals said that the execution of judge Shira Sheindlin's decisions would be suspended pending the results of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, a judge ruled that the city had violated the constitution in the way it carried out the street arrest and interrogation program.
The city appealed against its decision and decrees on corrective measures, including ordering the appointment of a supervisor to help the police department change its work practices and related training program.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a discussion of the parties on the motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal said it was necessary to dismiss the judge for violating the U.S. Code of Conduct and failing to deem it necessary to avoid bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court’s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably addressing blacks and Hispanics on a “stop-and-run” program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee the major changes, which include policy, training and monitoring reforms, and has also decided to launch a pilot program to test body-mounted video cameras in those police stations where most detentions take place.
In August, New York decided to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were terminated after a police check.
The city’s appeal hearing is due to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of “stop and search” has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
Stop-and-search has been practiced for several decades in some form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four people, all members of national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the Stop-and-Seek program in the New York Police Department say the changes will end unfair practices, create a more reliable and efficient police service, and could affect how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale rather than crime, result in unnecessary spending of money and do not solve the global problem of difficult conditions in the police due to the reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she does not stop the “stop-and-run” practice, which is in line with the constitution, but changes the way the NYPD stops people.
In the area of the Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
There is a new pedestrian zone in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a plot of two kilometers from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to Bolotnaya Square.
Street floor lamps, flower beds, benches, urns and toilets were installed throughout, deaf fences and illegal advertising were removed.
In addition to Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky lanes, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed to cars - Ordynsky dead end, Big and Small Tolmachevsky lanes, Kadashevskaya embankment and Bolotnaya Square.
Traffic on the streets of Maroseyka and Petrovka is not limited.
On the site of Pyatnitskaya street from the lobby of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to Klimentovsky lane, conditions for pedestrians were created without removing traffic and cutting the roadway, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the Church of the Holy Martyr Pope Clement, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, completely pedestrian Tverskaya pass, Stoleshnikov lane and Kuznetsky Most street.
Large Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, it was decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson hacked his phone to check a confidential message
Former editor of the News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm false information about the novel of Charles Clarke, who at the time held the post of Minister of the Interior.
Attorney Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey Court that in May 2005, the News of the World received the unreliable news that Clark was meeting with his “attractive special counsel” Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private investigator Glenn Mulcair to hack Polly’s voicemail and stalked her at home to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left voicemails, the court heard.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who would stand next to someone’s house hoping to catch someone by surprise, he is the kind of person who likes to offer a story to people to see what they have to say,” Edis said.
He said News of the World used three ways to investigate the stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, “Oh yes!”
Rumors of Clark's novel first caught the attention of News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A tape of voice messages received from her phone at least three times was seized from Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found recordings on a private investigator’s computer in which Miss Polby and her sister appeared as “Projects.”
During the period she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At this time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weatherap were monitoring Ms. Polby’s movements.
After leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edis said Coulson’s involvement in the story followed the same scenario as other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had engaged in a confrontation with Mr. Blankett over an affair with a married woman while he was dating a co-defendant, Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with other people to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Turlbeek and Weatherap confessed to hacking their phones.
Snowden declares readiness to communicate with the authorities of Germany in the case of wiretapping
Former CIA officer Edward Snowden expresses his readiness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so and meet with representatives of the German authorities.
A letter from a former CIA official to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestagsabgeordneter Hans-Christian Ströbele, through which Snowden conveyed the message to the German authorities.
Ströbele met Snowden in Moscow the day before.
As a result of the fire on Tverskaya street four people were injured
As a result of the fire in a collector in the center of Moscow, on Tverskaya street, four passers-by were injured.
According to Interfax, citing a source in emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, the passers-by were injured during the fire in the smoked underground passage.
According to RIA Novosti with reference to the head of the capital’s fuel and energy department Pavel Livinsky, now in all houses on Tverskaya street fully restored power supply.
The fire in the heat collector near the house 15 on Tverskaya street occurred in the evening of October 31.
Strong smoke came from the hatches of the storm sewer, and smoke formed in the underground passageway located near the Armenia store.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tverskaya Street were disconnected.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was extinguished.
U.S. Cuts Food Allowance for the Poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
From Friday, the U.S. is reducing the financial provision of food stamps, known as “food stamps”, as the relevant government program ends.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be $36 less per month than before, officials say.
It will affect the 47 million poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the financial year 2012 the benefit per person was on average 133 dollars per month.
U.S. food aid spending rose to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food stamps, which have been in the form of paper coupons since then.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts in funding for the program, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
Grocery store owners across America are worried that the cuts will lead to lower consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to debate how to further cut government funding.
Blizzard releases free 19-year-old platformer
Blizzard released their 1994 Blackthorne platformer for free on PC.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game became available on Battle.net in the section of classic games Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that currently it can download only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service.
For Russian users, the game is still not available.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on the PC, externally does not differ from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack for Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platformer, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlac decided to kill the bright king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlak's sidekicks and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game released by the studio after it was renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Previously, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
New machines will appear in the Moscow metro.
But they will not sell tickets to passengers for money, but for squats.
One trip costing 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 squats.
The number of squats will be counted by a special device with the help of modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Olympic Committee of Russia.
The first device will be installed at the "Exhibition" station on November 8, 2013.
The presentation of the new ticket sports machines will be hosted by the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova.
National Security Agency confessions increase corporate paranoia over state surveillance
In a warm afternoon at the end of August, a helicopter of the German police flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
According to the instructions of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), Germany’s internal intelligence service, his task was to photograph the roof of the US office building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV had hoped to detect the antennas of the listening devices, and this action led to talks between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, reaffirmed in September that the U.S. is not using foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal foreign companies’ trade secrets in the interests of U.S. companies to boost their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But ever since Edward Snowden, a contract clerk who became a whistleblower, began publishing his treasury of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company leaders are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency tracked Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last straw was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been wiretapped for perhaps about a decade.
If the most influential person in Europe can be a target, then, of course, potential targets are business leaders.
Snowden made clear the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it is likely that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
All the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, so far have not shown evidence that the U.S. has passed on foreign company business secrets to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the opinion that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical of this.
Someone in the German parliament is saying that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“It’s not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German business software company SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
Yet the reach and technical development of U.S. espionage agencies, made famous by Snowden’s revelations, have come as a shock to some companies who once thought China posed the greatest risk of surveillance.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technologies, where European business leaders are more aware that data stored in the US is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. participants abandoned plans to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after the disclosure of the U.S. data mining program Prism.
Jim Snape, one of SAP’s chief executives, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that didn’t arise a year ago, namely where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that it will physically stay in that jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore this data must be protected at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,” said Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of BASF Chemicals.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, and we are spying on them, too, because it is in our national interest to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders usually don’t like to brag about the retaliatory measures they’ve taken, as this can give an advantage to an opponent.
In large companies, it has long been the idea that taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is at least reckless.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it has been standard practice for many years to assemble mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution of Germany recommends that company executives consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their particular niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV warns.
The US warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
A U.S. national intelligence report in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second rank of economic intelligence hackers, after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst of all”.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of France’s internal intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.”
Parents of Georgia teenager who died by "ridiculous accident" believe their son was murdered
Parents of a Georgian teenager whose body was found inside a rolled-up sports mat in the gymnasium of his high school believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on Jan. 11 in a vertical mat leaning against the stands of his high school gymnasium.
Investigators at the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Department have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year-old boy disputes this.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” said Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff says.
“They believe it goes against logic, the laws of physics, and common sense,” Crump said.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag and he was returned to them in a corpse bag,” he said.
U.S. lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds" for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed Johnson had died as a result of “positional asphyxia.”
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, showed a different cause of death.
“There are a few issues that need to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s Department of Lowndes was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
A South Georgian judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all video footage of the security cameras that investigators had viewed.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the videos contained the key to unraveling how he died.
"Spartacus": For information about the persons who posted the fascist symbols
On the official website of "Spartacus" there was a statement of the Moscow club about the appearance of the fascist flag on the podium in Yaroslavl.
"At the Cup match "Shinnik" - "Spartak" on October 30, unknown provocateurs in the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated fascist symbols.
We appeal to everyone who has reliable information about the persons who committed this criminal offense, with a request to provide it to the security service of FC Spartak-Moscow at the e-mail address fcsmsec<0x40>spartak.com.
“Remuneration is guaranteed,” the statement said.
We are looking for fans who hung the fascist flag in Yaroslavl
Recall that in the match 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartacus" several times interrupted due to riots in the stands.
Also in the sector of Spartak fans, fascist symbolism was demonstrated.
In the form of punishment "Spartacus" can hold about three matches without spectators.
There will be a committee meeting on Friday.
If you have information about who carried and posted this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issue guidelines for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Currently, one in 20 children in the United States has food allergies.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among educators and service staff about food allergies in children and how to help in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline reserves — most often an EpiPen automatic medical syringe is used for injections — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently amended the regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline reserves with less difficulty.
The notice also includes a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is touching my tongue,” “It feels like I have hair on my tongue,” or “It feels like my tongue is pinching.”
Parents of intersex children can choose "uncertain sex"
Germany has become the first European country to recognize a third sex in children born with an external genitalia of intermediate type.
Newborns will no longer necessarily be attributed male or female.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate the gender as “undetermined” or “undetermined” on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to relieve pressure on parents who can make hasty decisions about sex reassignment surgery to newborns, and to counter discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later: “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I'm going to be a doctor-created patchwork product with bruises and scars.
Approximately one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual developmental disorders" - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed external genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still under-researched, but most experts in the U.S. say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to take advantage of all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the child’s psychological and physical development before surgery, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can assign the sex without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery as to why people are homosexual.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as different from transgender or transgender because their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological makeup, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female gender, and is typical for both at the same time or is not characteristic of either of them.
These characteristics may manifest in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and body structure; primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice-based crime.
Boys with gender anomalies now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to include male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian man, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as “genderless”, defending in court the right to maintain “uncertain” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F - X, that is, intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, a prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
Catholic Online, an American website, also disagreed with German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is being pulled into a new state, where gender is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer children to be sex-fixed at birth.
“Growing a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told a parent’s website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genital organs were called hermaphrodites – after a beautiful Greek god who possessed signs of both sexes.
And only ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which everything can be erased and then painted again.
But now many are questioning the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choices, not knowing how the child will perceive the gender assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency,’” Drescher said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist - you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with intermediate-type genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Manny of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easy to change.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social signals—how parents raise a child—interact with a child’s genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider themselves male or female.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis had been damaged during careless circumcision to castrate the child completely, removing also his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but that was not the case,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors are still "using this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these sex reassignment operations declared themselves “unhappy with the result.”
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but intermediate-type genitalia.
Doctors could not determine for sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” of a man.
So soon after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external genitalia and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was given a vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical records.
What he learned was awful.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for the normal development of the genitals.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, receiving injections of testosterone and removing his breasts.
The operation rendered him infertile.
Today, he stands up for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to bring people with intersexuality back to normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of California’s Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law “encourages labeling and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make hasty decisions and give their child an ‘undetermined sex’,” she said.
We are afraid that he will facilitate the intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign a male or female gender, and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to make choices in favor of the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender,” she says.
German law implies its appropriation at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist in Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexually impaired development and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said German law would “support” both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called "total androgen insensitivity syndrome."
Because her androgen receptors don't work properly, Katie has developed female traits.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and is undergoing a residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite being infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves,” Barac said.
It gives them time to do some tests and understand the situation, as well as a period of time before they write "male" or "female".
In this case, you are fine - raise a child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that drives parents because they don’t feel they’re doing the right thing,” she said.
Eventually, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with – and that’s great.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Khabibulin stressed: he understands that he should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of the Hawks, Khabibulin first missed six goals from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed goal.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I did not succeed," CSNChicago quoted Habibulin as saying.
- I need to find confidence in training, probably it is worth approaching them as games, and try to achieve a better result.
You need to study your past games and work on those flaws that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite decent.
But somehow after a few heads everything turns into a kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The goalkeepers - I don't think I'm the only one - always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what's going on in front of my gate.
I’m still working on myself so I don’t miss so many pucks.
It’s great that my teammates support me, but in principle it’s simple: I have to play better.
“Two games is not the whole season, but I wanted to do a lot better.
But it happened, it happened.
I have to put that aside.
I’m just going to try to play the next game better.
In the Altai turned over a bus.
In the Rubtsovsky district of the Altai Territory overturned bus line PAZ.
As a result of the accident, according to the updated data, 13 people were injured, the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations reported.
Earlier, the law enforcement agencies of the region reported about 10 victims.

On the bus from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, there were 12 passengers and the driver, all of whom received injuries of varying severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to the Rubtsovsk City Hospital No. 1, two people were hospitalized in the Rubtsovsk Central Hospital.
Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after consolidating in the markets of Latin America and Asia, the Superjet 100 aircraft will be supplied to Europe.
"We expect that in total we will receive such agreements for more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type," Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with French colleagues, since this is a joint project.
We discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that after this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and in the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that someday it will be supplied to France," the Russian prime minister stressed.
The SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is designed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment with 100 seats.
Power engineers of Dnipropetrovsk region have launched a unique program to save ... stork nests
In ancient times, to bring storks to the courtyard, peasants on a high pole installed a wheel from the cart, and the heavy nest held well on it.
Such special supports have not been put for a long time, so the storks chose the pillars of power lines - the intertwined branches rely on the wires, so that the real house stands securely.
Granny Anya, near whose house in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district for twenty years lived a real family, began to notice how the nest settled, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds put new branches on top, and the lower layer has already permeated between the wires, it is about to collapse.
Of course, it is a pity for the family of storks, which every year nestled in the yard, bred and fed three or four chicks during the summer, but even without light do not want to remain.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm regions, Grandma Anya called the Tsarichansky RES, which owns the support.
I didn’t expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest still holds at all, - said the technical director of DNEPROOBLENERGO Sergey Berezovsky.
Corrosion began on the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150-200 kilograms.
At any moment, the birds could die from an electric discharge.
And the locals risked being left without light due to damage to the wires.
Therefore, linear installers began the operation to save the nest, and not for the first time in our practice.
Scientists-ornithologists from the Dnipropetrovsk National University helped, who developed a scheme for the transfer of the nest.
They also conducted trainings for employees of district networks.
The famous Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised power engineers at all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
To begin with, it was estimated that there are more than 50 real "apartments" in the area in an emergency state.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were welded, resembling a funnel.
The base was braided with willow branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay the old branches as the basis for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Afterwards, the storks will build their own homes.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka, Novomoskovsky district.
A new reinforced concrete pole was placed next to the electrical support and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The entire operation cost the energy in nine thousand hryvnia.
And the other day the same new settlement took place in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrikovsky district in the yard of grandma Ani.
Here the platform was fixed in the same place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has undergone major repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of the Dnipropetrovsk region.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others mercilessly kill them.
Recently, the whole region flew around the sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for pheasants, poachers for entertainment shot swan family living in the local pond.
Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - the locals fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers, hearing the shots, ran to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying dead on the water.
Now the staff of the Apostolovsky district police department are finding out who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
The "Russian March" is becoming more popular
On November 4, on the Day of National Unity, the “Russian March” will be held in Moscow, agreed with the city hall.
According to the Levada Center survey, support for the Russian Marches is growing, with 40% of citizens approving the idea of holding them to varying degrees.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens in varying degrees approve of holding "Russian marches": 11% of them are definitely positive about such actions and 29% - "rather positive".
The popularity of the idea of "Russian marches" is gradually growing - in 2006 these actions were welcomed by only 14% of Russians, and in December 2010 the holding of such events supported twice as many citizens (28%).
"Definitely negative" to the "Russian Marches" are only 7% of Russians, "rather negative" - 19%.
Another 35% could not formulate their attitude to this action.
This year, the Moscow City Hall agreed to hold a “Russian March” of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Mayorov, said today.
This nationalist action has been held every year on National Unity Day since 2005.
To the question of sociologists “Have you heard that on November 4 in Russia are held “Russian marches” under the slogans of protection of the rights of Russians in Russia?” three quarters (75%) of citizens answered in the negative.
Currently, only one in five Russians (20%) knows about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 about "Russian Marches" were heard by almost a third of citizens (31%).
Recall that three years ago on December 11, a spontaneous rally of nationalists was held on Manezh Square, which turned into mass riots.
Levada Center also asked the Russians what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (People’s Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens are going to celebrate this holiday.
About the same number (17%) intend to celebrate the October Revolution Day on November 7.
The majority of citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How the Moscow City Hall agreed on the “Russian March” in Lublin
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to hold a “Russian March” on November 4 in Lublin.
This was announced by the leader of the association "Russian", the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the procession in Lublin on the Day of National Unity, a rally and a rock concert of the Kolovrat group will be held, also coordinated with the authorities.
How was the "Russian March-2012"
On National Unity Day in 2012, nationalists marched from Yakimanskaya embankment to the Central House of Artists, where the rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20 thousand people, the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the figure of 6 thousand.
Obama campaign considered the exclusion of Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama’s closest advisers were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 election list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of the all-anticipated book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 campaign “Bets Doubled: The Game Changed 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the president’s immediate aides conducted “large-scale focus group research and opinion polls in late 2011” to assess whether Biden’s exclusion could help raise waning hopes for Obama’s re-election.
According to the Times political columnist Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempt by senior officials of the campaign headquarters and the White House, namely the former head of the White House administration, Bill Daley, to assess the effect on the vote of the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton vice-president.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded at the Chicago campaign headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew a replacement was under consideration.
The book “Bets Doubled” claims that Daley was the initiator of the attempt to replace Biden despite their “close personal relationship” but eventually abandoned the move when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not “improve Obama’s chances substantially.”
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I actively advocated considering a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, ‘Oh my God, what are we going to do?’
Although Daley described the study as a “necessary check,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the campaign had invested a lot in exploring whether the move would bring dividends to the vote.
“Electoral campaigns don’t spend that kind of money on polls and focus groups unless they’re taking something seriously,” Martin said in the AK 360 program.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then-boss knew of a possible shagging.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of a possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that “perhaps” Obama knew.
Martin added that "Bets are doubled" does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political probe have reached the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama was unaware of the investigation into Biden’s exclusion from the electoral list.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first ice cream that shines in the dark with the help of a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop luminous food.
He came up with this idea after reading a scientific article about jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, raising the pH level of the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that because ice cream begins to glow when it responds to the heat of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Lick Me, I'm Delicious, says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at the very initial stage when it comes to production, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you get about 2 grams of the substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth warms up the protein, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will begin to glow.
We’ve been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed ideal to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful luminous effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the luminescence of a jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each balloon costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of leafy gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to make invisible ice cream.”
That’s by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we’ll find a way to do that.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
Avangard coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the regular KHL championship against Salavat, noted that the Omichi conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from Metallurg in Magnitogorsk.
The expert stressed that "Avangard" should pay attention to the game in defense.
We watched a video of the match against Metallurg of Magnitogorsk," Chebaturkin's words were quoted by the official website of Avangard.
- We missed a lot of pucks, not a very pleasant moment.
Missed because of their mistakes, because of failure to complete the game task.
We knew that the rivals had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks on the move - three pucks scored us.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in the preparation for today's game?
The guys and I thoroughly analyze each match, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is performed.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game was played and the score was 2-0.
We missed the goal "in the locker room" - and in the third period began to make mistakes.
Given how difficult the game was, there was no point in connecting the defenders.
We need to defend the whole team.
Now Avangard has a long home series, matches are held every other day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The main thing now - the realization of their moments and fulfillment of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you do the setup - everything is not so difficult to solve.
Due to the new rules introduced by the Russian customs, hundreds of trucks have been in line on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install biotoilets
Hundreds of trucks accumulated at border crossings at the entrance to Russia.
This situation arose due to changes in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the queue is created by the Russian side, which did not warn in advance about innovations.
From October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said the deputy head of Eastern customs Vladimir Denisov.
The document of the new model is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Carriage.
The checkpoints are operating in an enhanced mode.
The FACTS correspondent visited the border and talked to the truckers who were held hostage.
Prices in the roadside cafe-shop at the checkpoint "Novoazovsk" are growing every day, as well as the queue from trucks.
The trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
Customs terminal Novoazovsk - Veselo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport directions from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, the cargo is sent to the Stavropol Territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, before midnight, they were still allowed, and then these rules were introduced, - complains Alexey Golovanev, a long-distance truck driver (pictured), who is transporting cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan through Russia and has been spending the night in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment for cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is carried.
Minimum insurance - 4.5<0xE2><0x88><0x92>5 thousand rubles (about 1100<0xE2><0x88><0x92>1300 hryvnia).
Those who go nearby (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars, pay somewhere 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnias) and pass.
And the others are stuck - no one has such a lot of money with them!
Imagine, if the driver carries a cargo worth only four thousand dollars, but all the way to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for transit!
Conditions for survival at the border - none, - complain truckers, settled to eat near their cars.
In border shops and cafes and so always expensive, but such prices as here, we have not met anywhere!
The sellers oriented and quickly rolled them up: 15 hryvnias is a bar, seven hryvnias - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnias - a plate of soup.
There's only one coffee shop.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet there.
No washing, no shaving...
I can not get out of the car for a week, my wife prepared everything for the trip.
A week will stretch, - comforts himself another trucker Victor Skotarenko.
Will my car be in line in a week?
Why do you have one and a half liters of water? - we are interested in the only border store.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, a crystal bottle or water infused on silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
“Take it while you have something else,” the saleswoman says.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the distressed situation of Ukrainian drivers drew the attention of the authorities of the region.
The leadership of the Ambrose and Novoazovsk regional state administrations were instructed to provide drinking water to all who stand in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border, said Sergey Dergunov, acting chairman of the Donetsk regional state administration.
Ambulance teams are currently on duty at the checkpoints.
Biotoilets will also be installed for the convenience of people.
According to the official, the problem associated with the queues will be solved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Regional State Administration, as of October 31, at the international checkpoints "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk" were 32 and 68 cars, respectively.
"FACTS" will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius Suspects Moscow of Attempting to Defame Lithuanian President
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking figures of Lithuania and the countries of the Eastern Partnership, such a statement was made to the BNS agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to “discuss” the President of Lithuania Dali Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archives, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the preparation of the information attack is being conducted by the Department of Analysis of Public Processes of Administration of the President of Russia on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania more than once and took part in the Congress of the Lithuanian People’s Party.
Also, the participant of the operation allegedly is an employee of the department V. Smirnov.
Under cover of scientific work until the end of 2012, Smirnov regularly came to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnov is now banned from entering the country.
On the eve of the President of Lithuania Grybauskaite said that she was aware of the upcoming information attack.
In her opinion, the main reason is the successful presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and “the country’s striving for energy independence”.
The Lithuanian leader has previously repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She said that the Kremlin treats Lithuania "not respectfully enough".
In addition, Grybauskaite accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin of putting forward to Lithuania “only demands”.
In September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products does not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the leader of Lithuania said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the United States, a school director fired on teenagers.
Directors of one of the American high schools teenagers literally led to despair.
The man, he said, was forced to pick up a gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile bullies threw toilet paper at the man’s house.
Because of this, the school director opened fire on teenagers, as a result of which several wounds in the leg and arm received a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not in the property of the director, he was charged with assault under aggravated circumstances.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125 thousand.
Shooting civilians in the United States becomes a terrible pattern.
On the eve of the man opened fire in the center of the city of Ridgecrest in the US state of California directly on the passers-by on the street.
After that, the perpetrator took two passers-by hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier in the elementary school of the city of Newtown, Connecticut, opened fire.
Adam's mother worked at the school, she was a teacher.
Shooting at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlanta (Georgia).
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and organize a masquerade for our district.
Now I look more like a scoundrel.
I haven’t been invited to give out candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I probably won’t this year either.
However, statistics show that I am a white crow when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I look forward to every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that costumes will cost $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year, sexual inanimate objects are at the peak of fashion.
Women no longer need to be sex workers; they can also be sex food, such as pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for men, I think we’re going to see a lot of zombies with The Walking Dead, and I’m sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will hit our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the suits that are most often searched for are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren’t the only ones.
According to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we are not trivial.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That’s about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, lollipops, Milk Duds candies, Twizzlers chewable candies, and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-demanding children who have prepared to conquer our neighborhoods.
Moreover, we will buy and – let’s not fool ourselves – eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want to eat is corn grain-shaped candies; and yet, according to the National Confectionery Association, nearly <0xC2><0xA3>35 million of them are sold on Halloween.
That’s about 9 billion individual corn grains.
This is a mystery that I still have to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween like a ghost house.
They have amazing titles, such as “Horror Behind the Walls” (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), “Shout and Scream” and “House of Shock”.
Moreover, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized ghost houses in America, generating about $500 million in revenue, as well as those amazing photos where you almost peed, which your friend posted on Facebook and you can not remove, and then the guy who you like, sees this photo and leaves a comment like "classy facial expression".
Finally, let’s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving Jack’s lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we’ve been doing since childhood.
Luckily for us, the baby pumpkin fashion only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these pumpkins instead of sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack’s lamp, slowly drying out on your porch, probably came from Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want harder tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try cutting out something from their 2032-pound pumpkin.
Estonian Defense Ministry website restored after attack by Ukrainian hackers
The work of the Estonian Ministry of Defense website has been restored after the morning cyberattack, the ministry’s press service reported.
According to Vice Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for Information and Administrative Affairs Taimar Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly adjusted everything, by now the work of the site has been restored.
“The damage to the ministry is minimal,” Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to say who organized the attacks.
"We will certainly analyze the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from this, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents," he said.
On November 1, the group Anonymous Ukraine posted an appeal on the network, in which it confirmed a hacker attack on the Estonian Defense Ministry’s website and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be servants of NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO members.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be anyone’s slave.
We stand for an independent Ukraine.
"Hands off Ukraine," Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the company of the marines of the Feodosia separate battalion of the Ukrainian marines will take part in the command and staff exercises of the NATO response forces Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Due to the violence, several schools and hospitals had to be closed.
Four schools in Zimbabwe’s southern Matabeleland province have been forced to close after students were attacked by goblins.
According to the local elder, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue the classes.
The goblin story may sound like a child’s fiction to a European, but in Africa it’s a pretty serious argument for closing a school.
Adults are also afraid of evil.
In the summer, for example, a hospital in Zimbabwe was closed due to goblins also attacking the medical staff.
Announced the release of the racing series Land Rover

Additionally, you can get upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the car between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The participants of the rally applying to Bowler have changed.
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally.
We were very happy to develop the Defender Challenge car – it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to participate in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian security forces do not know anything about the group "Brotherly Circle" - News
About it writes INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
“After media reports appeared about the inclusion of Leps on the checklists of the US Treasury Department on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate ‘Brotherly Circle’, we searched all the databases, but we did not find such a group,” the source said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously written by “NI”, yesterday the US Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group “Brotherly Circle”.
Among them was the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
It appears on the list as "Grisha", posted the day before.
With the data of the popular Russian performer, they coincide.
The exact name - Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another from the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.
In the United States, they are sure that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, was transporting money for the bandits on their order.
A photo of the singer is attached to this message and all his data that corresponds to reality is indicated.
What’s more, Leps has actually recently bought a house in Phuket.
The ministry noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
The blacklisting of a person in the US Treasury entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and the prohibition of business contacts with him of persons living in the United States.
Assistant Lepsa Maya Serikova said that no notifications to the singer were received: "It is difficult to answer the question whether this is Gregory, who everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is the media.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know if they exist in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other - surprising and unexpected," she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, on Phuket Grigory Leps does not live, but, according to the US Treasury, he really has a house on the Thai island.
She said that now Leps is on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during a flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Escaped to the field in the match "Shinnik"
It became known some details about the identity of the fan, who ran to the field during the match 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia between Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and Moscow "Spartacus".
As stated by the head of the KDC RFS Artur Grigoryants, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
He is currently detained.
In addition, Grigoryants told about how the fan managed to break on the field: "It turned out that this, let's call him a spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing heart problems.
He went to the ambulance, the ambulance doctor confirmed.
And then he pushed the two companions away and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the Eastern and Southern Tribunes to the corner of the Eastern and Northern Tribunes.
He ran all over the field.
The stewards are responsible for that.
Until the entry into force of the law on sports, this is the zone of action of the stewards - the police can not interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the podium, crossed the East podium.
And at this time, riots began on the Eastern stand and on the treadmills," the head of the KDC said.
Recall that the decision of the KDC Moscow "Spartak" will hold without spectators the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the championship of Russia against the "Locomotive" and "Zenith", and will pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire crews were summoned to rescue a lost puppy that was stuck 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous career retreat
Cocker Spaniel Ruby fled after being involved in a small accident
Three days later, her, stuck in a career, noticed a man walking a dog
Firefighters descended on a rope on a steep slope to save the dog from imminent death
The puppy was lucky enough to escape after firefighters were called to pick him up and take him to safety after he somehow got stuck at an altitude of 50 feet on a dangerous slope.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker spaniel, ran away after being involved in a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Her owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at Flappit's quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They feverishly searched for their missing dog and posted appeals on social media sites after she fled to a quarry after a small accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a keen dog breeder noticed Ruby stuck at 50 feet on a leap in her quarry.
A technical rescue team from the Klekhiton fire station rushed to the scene, descended on ropes to rescue Ruby, and used a carry-on to lift her up the slope.
Rescue officer Andy Clayton said: “She was in a dangerous position.”
It was right in the middle of a steep slope – 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She did not move a muscle during the rescue, she completely froze.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.
Rescue officer Peter Lau said: “Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued.”
There was a possibility that she could have gotten a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a checkup, and it was found that she was all right, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing to have her in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she had fainted and lost consciousness, she would most likely have fallen.
The firefighters were great.
It was very brave of them to do what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr Alderson of Kitley added: “We were afraid it might fall, but it stayed there.”
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn’t flirt with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a backing vocalist for the 2004 Jagger song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she was having dinner with a veteran rocker, and noted, “He was flirting with me when I was 18.”
She added: “It was a long time ago and he was very kind.”
In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for the 70-year-old Jagger said he “categorically denies that he ever hit Katy Perry.”
The spokesperson added: “Maybe she’s confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: a break with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another horror story about independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join a pan-European free movement area as a condition of EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the barbed wire border along Hadrian’s Wall.
However, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movements across the rest of Europe, although – as predictable – this did not appear in the headlines.
Neither has anyone pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time to turn their formal rules around as they please.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for what it really wanted from the Scots.
This is not a worthy story.
And so old that it turned into a fossil: the first time I heard a “duck” that “independence means passport control” was at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment lost in the retelling of an old fairy tale.
Why does an independent Scotland have to obey Europe’s orders?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or in favour of the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany – founded just this year – emerged out of nowhere and garnered nearly five million votes in the September federal election, thus essentially ousting the Free Democrats (analogue to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments operate with excessive budget deficits – this was true only for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters – which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself at a pre-emptive disadvantage in terms of production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only way to save money is to cut salaries and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of the budget and the currency lies the deeper problem of Europe’s productive capacity.
As a result of the set of green energy measures implemented by Brussels – a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.
These are paralyzingly unfavourable price conditions, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
No wage freezes in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap U.S. shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, a revolt is ripening, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s ruined economy in dire straits.
The result is that Marine Le Pen’s right-wing anti-EU National Front party has just won a decisive additional election, dropping the ruling Socialist Party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to British Labour that it cannot be assumed that a split between the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If - and it is very likely - anti-EU parties gain support in this election, such a bloc will be able to take a dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
This is my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something like the vague “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several of its dependent economies could save the euro, but France and southern Europe would rebuild their own currencies.
I assume that the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
Yet Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that Britain will be left unattended in the cold Atlantic.
In what position does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect Scotland will be able to thrive under a freer European arrangement, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway's experience and preserving our economic independence.
The government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity, which won an impressive majority in 2011 thanks to objections to spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor of the Treasury Aleister Darling and the subsequent Tory and Liberal Democrat coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence just to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Ageing Earlier
African-American and Latino girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty
The tendency to early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to form the rudiments of the breast and grow pubic hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents — usually that doesn’t mean full puberty is coming soon,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in age in menarche (the first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
“Once the breast begins to develop, it’s at least two to three years before menarche,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of Early Puberty in Girls: How to Deal with This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but is considered "premature" when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in height up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or pause — this is something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression can serve as a basis for tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to slow growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child’s age, level of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but admits that “suppression of puberty can mitigate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from their peers.”
Another big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They’re worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they’re going to deal with hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and upset that she was the first among her friends.
There are many publicized theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
In boys, as in girls, puberty occurs earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the premise that has the greatest weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped carry out a study on girls between the ages of 6 and 9, which linked the amount of body fat to puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latino girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations.
All over the world, early puberty seems to be affected by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have facial and pubic hair at a younger age, the tendency to full early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair occurs even in infants and children of nursery age.
“We have to be careful about how we determine the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children’s Hospital Gorieb in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be embarrassed to receive instructions from a pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This could mean an earlier-than-expected conversation,” Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when it happens early, this process is a normal part of life.
Stuck in Chita, the American Boeing is preparing for flight
The American aircraft that conducted observation flights over Russian territory under the Open Skies Treaty and made an unscheduled landing in Chita on Wednesday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time, will leave the airport of the city.
The airport management allowed the board to depart, having received money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other sources, he will go to the United States.
As it was reported, the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Transbaikal Territory due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita airport.
There are 30 people on board the plane, including the crew, and they spent two nights at the airport, ITAR-TASS reported.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, under the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to go outside the airport of Chita, they can pass border control only at two airports in Russia - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude.
The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in 1992 and has 34 member states.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada and European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the development of transparency, assistance in monitoring the implementation of agreements in the field of arms control, strengthening the capacity to prevent crises and resolve crisis situations within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do deceased celebrities earn - MK in the US MK
The ranking of live celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was headed by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was overrun by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
Significantly behind him are other deceased celebrities, who last year "earned" several times less.
The second in the list of the most "rich" departed celebrities, compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million per year, and the line below the author of the comics Peanuts Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also includes Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
The first boutique of Igor Gulyaev opened in Moscow
October 23 was the opening of the first flagship boutique of Igor Gulyaev in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to the general public for his magnificent luxury fur products.
And now they will be able to appreciate even more fans of fashion - in Moscow finally opened his first boutique, which is why the designer and organized a party in the style of dolce vita.
I am sure that in Russia there are the most beautiful girls.
I am very happy to have opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there really is a part of me.
It is with such words that Igor cut the red ribbon and invited everyone to try the models!
Jet manufacturers are at odds over the width of the seat when large orders are at stake
A fierce controversy has erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Show this month.
The controversy revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers whose interests are not always the focus of the airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the claims about the efficiency of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would include a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class cabins, but its main U.S. competitor Boeing says it should be decided by airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales of increasingly larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected at the November 17-21 event.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft — especially whether 9 or 10 people sit in a row — is central to statements about the cost-effectiveness of new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing claims its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on economy-class seats over 17 inches wide placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class on 18-inch seats arranged 9 in a row.
Aircraft giants often exchange strikes on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to become the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war could be, showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant crammed together, entitled “Would you agree to this?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats that are narrower than those of regional turboprop aircraft,” said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
With the change in diet, people gain weight, but the plane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standard for modern long-distance travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average 21st-century American man is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. Health Service statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the 1950s seat concept, when the average waist circumference of those recently called the “reactive audience” was already there.
Airbus says it has commissioned a study showing that an extra inch in the width of the seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ figures on seat sizes and says manufacturers should not interfere in decisions on how airlines balance tariffs and convenience.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It’s really all about giving airlines the choice and the ability to do what they think they need to do to succeed,” said Boeing salon expert Kent Craver.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers, this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this controversy is a race for orders for aircraft valued at least $700 billion at catalog prices in the coming decades – enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the location of the seats is exactly what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the newest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing have reported a 20 percent profitability increase in their latest twin-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in the segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The stated characteristics of Boeing are partly based on the comparison of the 10-seat 777X series with the original 9-seat series layout of the 777 design solution.
The gain in unit cost decreases when compared to the 10-seat layout currently in use.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our developments,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins with full 10-seater rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer dense seats that can go hand in hand with lower fares.
“Eighteen-inch seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ offer is driven by the threat from the 777 model,” said interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Traveling around the world, jet sellers even take roulette with them to check competing plans.
Praising comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense cabin layout for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10-seater rows, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the need for additional cabin modifications, offering wider passage areas on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “take off”, but can divert attention from the wave of sales of the 777X model.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine can deprive the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell College of Medicine in New York said the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a strategy of vaccine use can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track down any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine stroke.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And mice that were not given the vaccine “relaxed,” and this is a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain high levels of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have the desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to stop smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get that pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and it could help them get rid of that habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Oleynikov: a third of rural settlements in the Moscow region are completely subsidized
Deputy Governor of the Moscow region Yuri Oleynikov said that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are fully subsidized
In total, 187 out of 288 settlements receive subsidies from the region’s budget.
In 2013, 187 out of 288 settlements received subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - 100% subsidies.
Within the framework of budgetary security, about 25 billion rubles are sent from the regional budget," Oleynikov said.
The deputy governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytishch, Odintsovo and Pushkino - have revenues of more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough".
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow region is more than 70%, "while there is a decrease in the quality of services," Oleynikov said.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipalities of the Moscow region by the end of November to think about what settlements need to be enlarged, unified into urban districts or change the system of administrative management.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Earlier, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the Moscow region, it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in Mozhaysky, Kashirsky, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomensky districts, Lyubertsy and Kotelnyky there is a request for the enlargement of municipalities.
Discussions on this issue in the cities and districts of the region will begin in November.
Chairman of the Mosoplduma Igor Bryntsalov also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of the Moscow region are planned to unite everything within the framework of the upcoming admreform.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region, less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 - subsidies.
Diana Arbenina celebrates Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide how much pleasure she receives from the upbringing of her children.
Despite the fact that right now Arbenina devotes a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds an opportunity to play with Marta and Artem, and not only spends time on their training, but also entertains as much as she can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
First, she posted a photo on Facebook showing her teaching children to read.
And yesterday I spoiled the fans, showing how she dressed Artem and Martha on Halloween.
For broom racing ready! our first halloween" - so Diana called a photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is not surprising, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday, since they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce “uncertain gender” when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow hermaphrodite-born children to be registered with "undetermined" instead of male or female.
The parents of the child will have the right for a time to leave the column "gender" in the birth certificate blank.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male), parents can temporarily write "X" (indefinite).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to rush with the operation to "clarify" the gender.
According to statistics, one in every 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation into the state’s anti-corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi has denied changes to the lease of seaside properties at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned stakes in three properties on state land.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several state ministers to extend leases to Serkular Key, where the Obeid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without a tender after they expired in August 2005.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's covert involvement in real estate, following testimony given by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy head of administration, Lynne Ashpool, on Thursday.
During several years of discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put up for public tender.
The tenants were against it, and also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, the leases of enterprises to Serquular Key, which brought the Obeid family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
However, he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who acknowledged that Mr. Tripodi had urged changes to the Government ' s rental policy.
The ICAC's transcript of the telephone conversations cited conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had come to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
“Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations a question of developing a commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willie Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to a senior official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli warplanes struck targets in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on missile cargo inside Syria.
Foreign workers on visas of subclass 457 can be tested for "authenticity"
The “authenticity” test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the government as it outlines an expansion of repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, would apply to criteria aimed at preventing the use of Class 457 visas to fill unskilled positions or as a loophole for moving family and friends to Australia.
The paper, submitted by the government for discussion, was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McKew criticized the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“Louder statements like ‘foreigners are at the end of the queue’ and ‘Australian jobs first’ represent a very unpleasant reversal to a time when trade unions demanded a protected labor market,” she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was the white work that needed to be protected – and if some in the region saw echoes of this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The document sets out 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to meet with officials about human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, with the rest under consideration.
If the “authenticity” criteria are accepted, the visa applicant can be examined to see if “the candidate is genuine in conditions where the candidate is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person related to the financing of the enterprise”.
Companies may also be required to report on the number of holders of visas of subclass 457, since previously enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of employees, then hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker has reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man’s nine-year-old son, grief-stricken, accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also aboard the ship.
Australian authorities rushed the man to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A friend of Semen Varlamov said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of hockey player Semena Varlamov Evgenia Vavriniuk said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” the woman said.
Recall that Vavriniuk sued for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semyon Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
According to her, the hockey player pulled her by the hair, and also beat - after the attack, her arms, chest, abdomen and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came with the perpetrator to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail of $5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete in movements around the country, but prohibited him from approaching Vavriniuk.
He also faces up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland of the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of high-speed communication with Scotland and the north of England, with the start of the First Phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer noted that the project “will unite the UK”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" about the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first stage will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second stage is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in rail capacity and shortening travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the ability to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal under HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it’s also about connecting cities to each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get better connectivity thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to “unambiguously” support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed rail has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland’s economic weight to the overall argument for a high-speed rail across the UK.”
We are therefore delighted to work in partnership with the UK Government to consider options for building a high-speed railroad in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh rail line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with British ministers next year and deciding jointly on the next steps.
Is thorium the new hope for nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) negatively affects the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear power does not do both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste in recycling.
Recently, scientists have drawn attention to thorium, another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and, according to experts, its cleavage does not leave waste, which must be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Australian airline passengers will need to keep their tablets and smartphones switched off during takeoff and landing, despite U.S. measures to ease regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided that they remain in Flight Mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision, which required U.S. airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they are considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Administration currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at all times, and passengers to comply with the safety rules reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of use on board its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to the changes, but said it would follow the regulator’s instructions.
“We would welcome consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of the issue of authorizing the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the onboard wireless entertainment system) is on our planes,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas has said it will abide by the current rules.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not plan to change it anytime soon,” she said.
The FAA decree applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the FAA’s decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, rules for carrying hand luggage and instructions for passengers.
“Once the airline has tested and confirmed the interference resistance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group's recommendation, heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan heard in the anthem of the Kuban notes of extremism
The football match between Anzhi and Kuban resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the anthem of the Kuban sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday proposed to the republican parliamentarians to apply to the court, because the anthem of the Krasnodar region allegedly gives calls for interethnic strife, in particular, calls for war with the "Basurmans".
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory, it is in our time in 1995 approved this anthem.
It's a shame, and no one does it.
"Remembering you here, as a mother to the enemy, to the Basurman, we are going to the battle of death" - for which such words to write in the anthem, to poison some believers on other believers," - expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov Speaker of the Parliament Hizri Shihsayidov.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from across the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel struck Russian-made missiles reportedly intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done as part of an agreement brokered by Russia that allowed the U.S. not to carry out the military operation it had come close to this summer.
More about the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president, will tell our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poisonous gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal made by Assad’s friend, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
The group of international experts reported that Syria had dismantled declared chemical weapons factories.
The longer-term and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it is about a thousand tons.
Washington has said that Assad’s days are numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and must go.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The chemical weapons agreement has been called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has made the impression of a man willing to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the US ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, its mother is hardly easier than the fact that he was not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is holding on.
Changing weapons for power.
The President of the Russian Federation created a separate Ministry of construction and utilities
Russian President Vladimir Putin has created a new ministry overseeing construction and utilities issues and proposed to head it to the former governor of the Ivanovo region, Mikhail Menu, in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men at the residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and Men did not refuse to head the new department.
Press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov explained that all the functions related to construction and utilities are transferred to the new ministry from the Ministry of the region.
Mikhail Men - the son of the famous Orthodox priest Archpriest Alexander Men, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemicals named after Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergievo-Posad district, was a deputy of the State Duma, the first deputy prime minister of the government of the Moscow region, deputy prime minister of the government of Moscow.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of the Ivanovo region.
Singapore pawnshop owners are doing well while the middle class is struggling
In a pawnshop in Bendemir shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga lays a gold bracelet, a ring and earrings to pay for her daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family’s monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia — where household debt is growing — is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its transaction, this week became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
A Jewelry Loan is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga), but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Usually, pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% – just above the 15.4% offered at the United Overseas Bank branch, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel pressured by the rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and cheap credit fueled by free monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pawnshops to offset declining incomes as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor’s, a rating agency, pointed to the increase in family leverage, mainly due to the rise in mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest debt-to-GDP ratios of households in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about Thailand’s high levels of consumer debt, which barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising prices, people in the middle and bottom [income scale] will be looking for ways to replenish their income wherever they can,” says Song Seng Woon, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record high gold prices in the last two years have intensified the rush with which people pawn their personal belongings as they seize the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items laid in the 200 pawn shops of the city-state are gold products.
People say, “The price of gold looks good, let’s lay the grandmother’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator EasyMoney has seen the number of customers using its offices grow in recent months up to 20%.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have sparked a fire of criticism due to high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the pawnshop not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase debt directly.
“Customers lay down items they already own, and monetizing personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The institution is gaining increasing public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured financing.
At the same time pawnshops are used not only by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches by pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short period of time for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome temporary cash difficulties,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.
Today, the population is important not the number of available medical institutions and their status, but the quality of medical care provided.
The implementation of the program "Modernization of health care of the Tula region for 2011 - 2013", the reorganization of medical institutions of our city will allow to create an optimal structure of medical care for the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and women in labor.
So, after the unification with the hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the GUS "NGKB" for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the maternity hospital was significantly improved, modern equipment corresponding to world standards appeared.
During these years, about 8 million rubles were allocated for major repairs of the premises, 112 units of equipment were purchased for the amount of 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In the operating room during the cesarean section, the device "Sell-Saver" is used, which allows you to collect blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, return it to the woman in labor, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
The department of clinical and laboratory diagnostics is also equipped with modern equipment.
In the women's consultation there is an electronic registry, in the near future it is planned to introduce electronic cards and patient histories.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it was possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, pregnant women and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beaten and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens have been arrested by French police on suspicion of attacking prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes from one of the Strasbourg hotels and then beat and robbed them.
The head of the gang was a 27-year-old previously convicted native of Chechnya.
Bayern defender David Alaba became the best athlete in Austria in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he overtook representatives of winter sports, which have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place went to the skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third - ski jumper Gregor Schlierenzauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian origin helped his team win the Champions League, the German Championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
The former wife of Arshavin rests with actor Andrei Chadov
The former civilian wife of the football player of St. Petersburg "Zenith" Andrey Arshavin Yulia Baranovskaya is on vacation with actor Andrey Chadov.
Yulia rests in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zadorozhna, her fiancé - skater Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Photos from joint walks of couples published in Instagram Anastasia Zadorozhnaya.
This is not the first photo of Andrei and Julia together.
On October 5, Zadorozhnaya published a photo in which the couple stands hugging on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, the midfielder of Zenit Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his civilian wife Yulia.
Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
Recently it became known that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alice Kazmina.
A new friend of Arshavin was married to a top manager of the corporation.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmania’s health
The federal government insists that a $325 million bailout package for Tasmania’s weakened health system will be complemented by tough conditions that ensure the state government does not waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent measures" to prevent a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.
The four-year funding decision was made after consultations between the government and independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state,” Ms. Plibersek said in a statement.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a planned Blitz campaign.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help bridge the gap.
There is also money for clinics that receive patients without prior appointment, in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of post-hospital care, training of medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
“This investment will go to the ideas expressed by leading doctors on how best to help the health system in Tasmania,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would operate in a regime of strict accountability and accountability.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it spends those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state delivers services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will not solve anything “unless they are followed by genuine reform that puts Tasmania’s health care system on a more sustainable footing.”
However, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to bringing this state’s health care system out of a critical state,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional sample procedures largely offset recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is a “solution similar to a patch.”
“The reason we’re here is because the state’s Labour government spilled $430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government pulls out nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, you can’t pretend that this is good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicklou’s adaptation of Denis Diderot’s novel boasts exceptional staging and historical details, but it’s also harder to handle than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760s, the film tells the grim story of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to a monastery by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to vulgarity or sensation — and that’s the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative runs the risk of becoming a test for the audience as well.
Syria Destroys Its Chemical Weapons, Observer Says
Syria has destroyed major equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, an international monitoring group said on Thursday, as violent clashes rage in the north of the country, near one of the sites believed to hold toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before the
The deadline of 1 November set by this Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or “incapacitate” all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms that allow chemicals to be mixed with toxic gas and to be filled with ammunition.
Completing what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The statement was made during fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts believe is home to a chemical weapons facility as well as its storage site, the Britain-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights said.
A group of activists who tracked casualties through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the part of the government, the group said, 29,954 people are members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Among the dead were 2,202 army defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
The United Nations estimates that 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting rebels in Safir for weeks, many of them linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The fighting highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of a toxic arsenal, in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
In a statement, the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was “now satisfied that it has checked and seen destroyed all Syria’s declared critical production facilities and mixing/refuelling equipment.”
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspection work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites claimed by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the two sites for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to a statement by Syria, “abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items contained in them were moved to other declared sites that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safir was one of two places OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I applaud the courage and courage you all have shown in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzumjiu, Director General of the OPCW’s monitoring group.
For the third year in a row, the civil war has pitted rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, against the Assad government and its security forces, which consist of members of its Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
Regarding other developments, Rami Abdurrahman, the center’s head, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at a air defense facility in Syria’s coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over Bali terrorists' convictions
The survivors and relatives of the 202 killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict handed down to the last of the conspirators, who appeared before the court, and declared that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted men, was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Monday for his role in building the explosive devices used in the attack.
He can be released for 15 years if he receives parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass killings in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also convicted of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a man nicknamed “the bomber” for his reputation as a master of explosives should be sentenced to death.
The decision exacerbated the painful memories of Perth mother June Cortine, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost a decade ago.
Hardly holding back her tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
He must face the firing squad,” Ms. Cortin told AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing I won’t have any more grandchildren and I won’t see my daughters.”
The Surrey Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was put into a van parked outside immediately after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After this attack, he fell into a coma for a month and “died” three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr. Hughes said Patek must share the fate of three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terror cell responsible for the massacre, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds isn’t much.
Patek is the last of the Bali terrorists to stand trial.
He had been hiding for nearly a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent revealed that intelligence data showed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” Ms. Cortin said.
Until recently, he did not regret at all how much grief he had caused other people.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Ms. Cortin says.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make calls from a mobile phone)”
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect the changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAU administrator Michael Worth said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and device styling rules to meet the new guidelines.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already unveiled plans.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They must not restart them until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain gives the "good".
Passengers should turn off their devices again when the plane descends for landing, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are adequately protected from electronic interference could allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Flight Attendants Association, welcomed the changes.
“Once the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option,” Glading said.
We’re frankly tired of feeling “on school duty” when it comes to this issue.
But connecting to the Internet for surfing, exchanging emails, texting or downloading data would still be banned at altitudes below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices into aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no “Words with Friends” — an intelligent Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when there was a notorious case: the actor was taken off the plane of American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was at the gate.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be stacked in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly all over the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones in flight will also be prohibited.
Regulatory powers for telephone calls are vested in the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAU may lift ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they have the potential to create interference for navigation devices, but we know through the FCC that they can create interference for cell towers when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government allow more use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been increasing pressure on FAAs to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCasquill argue that there are no compelling security reasons for the bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radios, high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of the liners are adapted for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices typically emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit only minimal signals when scrolling pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company loaded an entire airliner with its Kindle e-book readers and flew on it to check for problems, but never found them.
FAU Advisory Committee members expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of the devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association said he believes interference from devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said there were only individual pilot reports confirming that the devices could create interference to aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to disconnect devices during instrument landings in restricted visibility conditions.
A group of tourism industry representatives welcomed these changes, calling them a reasonable step towards passengers, who now use a variety of technological devices.
“We are delighted that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Dow, Director General of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Driving schools will be able to conduct exams for obtaining a driver’s license
Exams for driving licenses will be able to take private companies that have their own computerized circuit.
This is reported by "Kommersant" with reference to the draft government resolution "On admission to driving".
According to the newspaper, there are currently about 30 such racetracks in Russia.
It is assumed that students of such "privileged" driving schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Automobile Inspectorate will monitor the passing of exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of theoretical exams and more than 20% of the course students do not pass the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for the autodromes, contained in the draft government decree, come into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains requirements for training in driving two-wheelers.
Starting January 1, 2015, motorcycle owners will be required to pass a category A test in urban traffic.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire drivers of foreigners with foreign rights.
Such workers will be required to obtain Russian rights after passing the exam.
A bird airlifted to safety from a North Sea drilling rig is released back into the wild
A bird that was airlifted to shore after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea has been released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed in a helicopter heading for Aberdeen last month, and was then released by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at a rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, the center’s manager, said: “This water shepherd is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has fallen into a zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird was exhausted and was able to find shelter on the oil rig.
He added: “She was unable to take off again, so they turned to us for help.”
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and determine what changes the UK’s wealth and jobs creators want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in the UK by size, sector and region.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are currently looking for opportunities to export outside of Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnant.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and arduous process of reforming the intricate EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in the European trade zone, even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreed with this.
Last but not least, our survey of business leaders revealed that an overwhelming majority wants the UK to pursue a trade-based rather than policy-based approach to treaty change and relations with the EU.
This result, which has been seen among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that the business is pushing for a “significant change” that will bring authority back to the UK.
The stakes are high – achieving treaty changes and more favourable terms for the UK would provide a 16 percent shift in voting to stay in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubts: this survey shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain’s EU membership.
It also shows that business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
Better conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and, as our survey shows, for businesses, this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels’ regulatory activity.
U.S. spies tapping Pope's personal phone
The Vatican’s activities are under the watchful eye of US intelligence agencies.
New documents from Edward Snowden’s collection show that U.S. intelligence has been listening in on all of Pope Benedict’s previous talks, and is now closely guarding Pope Francis.
His phone had been wiretapped before he became head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also monitored.
In the United States, it was given special importance.
The intelligence service connected to the cell phones of the cardinals, who gathered in Rome to elect the next pope.
The phones of the residence where the conclave participants lived were also wiretapped.
American spies listened to all the main contenders for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure for Washington.
According to Panorama magazine, the “big ear of the United States” continued to intercept the prelates’ conversations until the end of the conclave on March 12.
The United States has designated Archbishop Bergoglio of Argentina as the future Pope since 2005.
U.S. intelligence also tracked talks related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to work at the U.S. Embassy in Rome, obtaining information about policies and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican reconcilingly announced that it does not care about the American “tapping”, even if it happens.
From the leadership of the United States, the Holy Fathers have no secrets.
Snowboarder for the Olympic bill specially photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the bill is 100 rubles.
But online bloggers are already actively ironic about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that the image of the snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photo banks.
In particular, in the free photo store StockExchange, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop tutorial published on the Russian website Megaobzor on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in advertising smartphones RugGear.
The Olympic note is made in blue-blue scale.
On one side is depicted a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - a view of the Olympic stadium and the Firebird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuyev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named after Repin.
At the presentation, it was noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and jumping, but in the end they chose snowboarding, since it is a relatively young sport.
According to a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the public opinion about the widespread distribution of the image of the snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak are not too concerned about the hype around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service of Gosznak Natalia Nikiforov told Izvestia that all the arguments about plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote is turned to the right, in the photos on the network - to the left, - said Nikiforov.
The person at the photo session to create the bill was taken from different points, then the final image was chosen, on it - the characteristic posture of the snowboarder.
She also noted that the copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, since the artist received a salary for his work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is quite positive.
Recognition of the image on the bill is a plus for its promotion, - says the executive director of NP "RusBrand" Alexey Popovichev.
It is quite difficult to prove the one hundred percent similarity of images on the banknote and in photo banks, so lawsuits to challenge intellectual property on this image are unlikely to arrive.
For the first time the Olympic banknote appeared in China - for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 was issued a commemorative banknote in 10 yuan.
Russia has decided to uphold this tradition.
Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their estimates, beer consumption in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Initially, businessmen were expecting growth.
After all, this year is unsuccessful for them: sales fell by 7%.
All this was told by the head of one of the largest breweries in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Goods of Daily Demand in Russia", which has just concluded in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already shrunk by 18 percent, as in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of the production and circulation of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction of the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and illogical prohibitions, which are allegedly justified by the fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer lamented that many legislative prohibitions designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not have much impact, yet new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The most painful for beer producers was the ban imposed since this year on selling alcohol at kiosks.
“We immediately lost 35,000 consumers,” said Isaac Sheps.
For next year, the brewers have two forecasts.
Optimistic - the one that Sheps talked about: sales of foam drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall another 2-3 percent.
To save their profits, businessmen are forced to move away from the varieties designed for mass consumers, to the class "premium": beer will become less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of a drop in sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"According to my observations, the level of alcoholism remains at about the same level," said Alexey Sotnikov, a narcologist.
However, the proportion of patients who use surrogates of strong drinks has increased, as well as those who "crapped" on alcohol-containing tonic drinks like "Jaguar", while ten years ago it was "beer" alcoholism that prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford car factory in Vsevolozhsk.
As they say in the trade unions, all the fired received compensation.
However, much more acute than the problems of workers, the question of reducing industrial production in the region arises.
The deputy of the regional ZakSa Alexey Etmanov at the meeting said that at the plant of the company "Ford" in Vsevolozhsk reduced about 600 people.
According to him, this happened in September: then under the program of voluntary dismissal, which was developed together with the union of the organization, about 600 people left the plant.
The workers, who decided to quit on their own, were offered “golden parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left jobs of their own accord.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think it's limited to that.
However, the authorities in the next two years do not plan to adopt any programs to support regional enterprises in a difficult situation," he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
Ford does not deny or confirm this information.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company's plans to lay off 600 people became known in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of production of cars.
As a reason for the plant called the drop in demand for cars "Ford" in Russia.
According to Petrostat, by the end of nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in the Leningrad region decreased by 5.4%.
Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
In the United States, it will be possible to use mobile during the takeoff and landing of the aircraft
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during takeoff and landing of the airliner approved in the United States, according to the BBC.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, the new rules will come into force by the end of 2013.
However, communication with the Internet to receive and send e-mails will be prohibited during flights at altitudes below 3 kilometers.
Due to the danger of interference with the radio equipment of aircraft, cellular voice communications will still be banned.
Thus, passengers of flights will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of using electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile on aircraft technology and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, following the example of the United States, the current standards for the use of electronic devices in flights may also be revised in the UK.
The Russian mafia in the United States finally established a new name - "Brotherly Circle"
This week, the blacklist of the “Russian mafia” in America has been replenished with new names and four companies.
The US Treasury Department introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli into the “Brotherly Circle”.
One of the Russians turned out to be the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States is suspected of transporting money for members of the group.
In total, the US blacklist includes 22 people involved in the “Brotherhood Circle”, and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization actually exists.
“The Brotherhood Circle statement is more like an attempt to unite disparate criminal groups,” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York.
In his opinion, the “Brotherly Circle” reflects the popular perception of the “Russian mafia”.
“I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” the US Center for Corruption and Organized Crime Research quoted Galeotti as saying.
Professor Liz Shelley of George Mason University agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
“If they work together, it’s more like a criminal network, not an organization,” she said, according to the Center for Corruption and Organized Crime Research.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “Brotherly Circle” unites to a greater extent the approximate Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Ded Hasan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakhari Kalashova, who added to the list in 2012, were closely related to Grandpa Hasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was Grandpa Hasan's nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some personalities were not related to Usoyan.
In his opinion, they all had common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the “Brotherly Circle” of Grigory Leps, the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect that we will receive more detailed information from our American colleagues, in connection with which such a decision was made, why it was included in such lists, - said the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today, a landmark event took place: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began,” Gazprom Chairman Alexey Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia’s export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which holds most of Russia’s European-destined gas, raises the level of risk for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said the direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts working in 2015.
Gazprom said that construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The pipeline’s annual design capacity is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA Employees Charged With Sexual Offences Even Before Charges Against Jonathan Lord Became Known to the Royal Commission
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with sexual offences against children before charges were brought in 2011 against a Karingbah child care facility employee, Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But the commission’s opening statement said it had “never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within its organization.”
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about one case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Fernes, the lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA also made an inaccuracy in its opening speech to the commission, arguing that “there were YMCA external audits that acknowledged that the YMCA was at the forefront of child safety.”
The evidence presented to the commission indicates that the YMCA was notified that it had received the second out of four possible assessments based on the results of a quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, acknowledged that he and his subordinate leadership had misplaced the Lord and had also failed to ensure that staff had a clear understanding of their obligations regarding reporting violations of child safety policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual misconduct against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that YMCA’s corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting the Lord’s violations in the field of child safety.
Employees testified that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, personally cared for them, placed them on his knees, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Oakwell, who was under the Lord's guidance and asked to be trained in child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnath, the childcare manager of the YMCA's Karingbach branch, who was the Lord's leader, "very frightening and often inaccessible."
The Executive Director said he did not accept staff explanations that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with the Lord deterred them from having to report him.
Mr. Hare said he presented to the New South Wales YMCA Council his view that the lesson for an organization from the “Jonathan Lord incident” was not “towards providing information” by employees, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were made was made by YMCA’s director general of child custody, Liam Wheatley.
He said it was meant to prevent evidence from being corrupted, but it was “overdone” and poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a child-friendly organization during Jonathan Lord’s tenure between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child molestation, told the commission.
He said there were “serious challenges” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training, and overseeing staff.
The hearing is postponed until December 20.
Fashion Week in Sao Paulo.
In her homeland, she is considered not just a model, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Gisele Bündchen left work for a while, distracted by motherhood, these days and for this week of parade she came on purpose.
Many months of absence did not prevent her from retaining her place on the podium and on the podium.
Giselle remains the highest paid supermodel in the world.
This time she participated in the parade of the Kolcci brand.
The Fashion Week finale is usually the most interesting show.
Like the stylist Lino Villaventura organized.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of luxury ready-to-wear, the designer actively works in theater and cinema, designing performances and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies that are relevant to the textile industry and the fashion world took part in the closing fashion week in São Paulo.
It is one of the most dynamically developing industries, employing more than 2 million Brazilians and an annual turnover of $ 50 billion.
Tony Blair said he would seize the chance to return as UK Prime Minister, but acknowledged that a return is unlikely.
On the evening before, in an interview marking the fifth anniversary of his resignation from his post, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since resigning in June 2007, after a decade as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the four Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked whether he would return to the post of prime minister, Blair said, according to the London Evening Standard, “Yes, of course, but it’s unlikely to happen, so...”
The head coach of Milan Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret about the result of a draw in the match of the 10th round of the championship of Italy with Lazio.
The expert also noted that the failures at the start are due to a series of injuries of the leading players.
I am very sorry that we did not manage to win - quotes Tmw Allegri.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we did not allow Lazio.
In the second Romans added, but in general I can not say that we have lost concentration.
We had to win.
Last season we did our job of getting into the Champions League.
Now we are behind the schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries of key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
Equestrian experts coming to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before taking his first steps, this baby with his pet Shetland pony Toffee lynx rushed through three rounds to easily take the top prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable pair of the same height received high marks for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is held by the equestrian center Sunnybank in the city of Radry near Cardiff.
Coming out for public viewing against the backdrop of men and women in elegant hats, he moved his cap and proudly spent around the circle of two-year-old Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffy received the highest rating for appearance and character.
Fenton was given Toffee for his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has practiced with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffee make a beautiful duet."
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rosette.
It was just his second performance with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Totally strangers in the arena considered it so phenomenal that they wanted to take a photo with him.
This boy from the village of Nantigloo, near Abbe Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “The entire audience was amazed and everyone shouted applause and clapped.”
He ran across the sand all over the arena and, although he looked so tiny, he did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens to look after.
Judging by the way he started, he will soon be taking part in the “Horse of the Year” – and I am sure he will perform well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The judges praised Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves in the show ring.
They appreciate the consistency of the pony and breeder's performance - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
Chinese newspaper 'subject to reorganization'
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the front page of the call for the release of the accused in the defamation of the reporter, should be reorganized, according to the regulator of the press.
The Guangzhou-based newspaper New Express made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes for writing false articles about a company with a state ownership stake.
Now the “New Express” has to go through the “process of complete correction of errors”, as reported by the regulator.
The order to “correct errors” came from the Guangdong Authority in the areas of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that Yangcheng-owned Evening News Group newspaper New Express published several false reports about the listed Zoomlion company between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial staff of New Express was disoriented," the regulator said in a statement.
He said the decision had been made to “impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revocation of his reporter’s license.”
He also instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a full correction of the New Express errors and recommended that it investigate the newspaper’s related officials and make immediate changes to the New Express management.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for The New Express in which he claimed financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page, stating that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television with a confession that he published false articles for money.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn the public’s trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I craved money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen’s confession, the New Express published an apology on the front page, saying the newspaper had failed to properly check his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of extracting confessions is still widespread in China, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to self-deprecate.
U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel discovered, equipped with its own railroad
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. authorities have described the four-by-three-foot-wide tunnel as one of the most complex secret passageways they have ever discovered.
This zigzag tunnel, which is almost six football fields long, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
The area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were imperceptibly transported through it, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officers seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when they discovered the tunnel.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officials, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in central Mexico after harvesting marijuana in October, which put drug cartels on the challenge of delivering their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passageway about 700 yards long, equipped with rail tracks that ran from the kitchen of one of the homes in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Pensions increase in Belarus since November
In Belarus, since November of this year, pensions have been increased, BelTA correspondent in the main department of pensions of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection told.
From November 1, this year, the average wage of workers in the republic, applied in the previous recalculation of pensions, will be adjusted with an increase in its value by 5.4% and the corresponding recalculation of labor pensions will be made in accordance with the Decree No. 478 of October 21, 2013 "About increase of pensions".
As a result of the recalculation from November, old-age pensions will increase, on average, by 5.3%.
The average age pension will be Br2 million, 295,000.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents of the republic.
The expenses of the Social Protection Fund of the population of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November of this year will increase by Br274.3 billion per month.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of labor pensions in November of this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplements to pensions will be recalculated due to the increase in the budget of the subsistence minimum on average per capita.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - 2.1% higher than the one for the period from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, from November 1, the amount of minimum labor pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and supplements to pensions will be increased by 2.1%.
In Belarus, for the payment of pensions, taking into account the increases in 2013 laid more than Br53 trillion.-0-
British police give Assange extradition notice
British police today handed over the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had handed the 40-year-old Australian an “official demand to surrender” requiring him to appear at the police station, adding that if that requirement was not met, he would be subject to further arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges after he exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the US, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “presented the 40-year-old man with an official demand to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice,” the spokesman said.
He continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the notification to the police.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the U.S. for possible espionage charges after publishing more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
Driver who drove 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs is fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at speeds up to 130 mph (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a takeout drink between his legs.
In the Colchester Court of Justice, Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due diligence and attention.
Adding seven penalty points to his driver's license resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay a <0xC2><0xA3>90 fee and an additional <0xC2><0xA3>100 fee to assist crime victims.
Tax for foreign property owners will cause the London bubble to burst
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but awaits a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a government duty rate of 7% for homes worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual payments for buyers who choose to own homes in a partnership rather than as individuals.
So far, the <0xC2><0xA3>708 million residential property tax in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea districts in the 2012/13 fiscal year has already exceeded the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: “Following the increase in the state duty on expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-evasion legislation, it is very difficult to argue that taxation of expensive real estate is understated regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this move could lead to some foreign investors being reluctant to buy real estate in London or the current owners not wanting to sell it,” he added.
The value of first-class real estate – the top 5-10% of the housing market at a price – in London’s rich southwest belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady year-on-year growth of 5.6 percent, but were overshadowed by an actively developing “domestic market” with price spikes in the southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the movements of the dog's tail are related to its mood.
Previous studies have shown that satisfied dogs wag their tails to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while anxious dogs wag their tails predominantly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the canine family may notice these subtle differences in tail-drilling and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, says: “It is well known that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain participate differently in the formation of stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
He added that just like humans, dogs have the right side of the brain that controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the versatile tailings of other dogs, the researchers observed the animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
It is likely that soon we will understand why their tails are sometimes directed in one direction, and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs videos with the dogs – either naturalistic versions or a silhouette to get rid of any other distortions, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and point the tail more to the left or to the right.”
When the animals saw that the otherwise unexpressing dog was moving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the wagging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail tilted mainly to the left (again from the point of view of a wagging dog), their heartbeat increased and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs intentionally communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience which movements they should be worried about and which they shouldn’t.
He observes: “If there are multiple encounters with other dogs, and often their tails roll in one direction is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on this experience.”
The researchers say these findings could give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal’s emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said this was not the first study to test whether the left and right sides matter to dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a satisfied dog.
And in another study at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when the whirl of its tail was directed to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious, the opposite behavior to the Italian study.”
He said the differences may have been due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
"While there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes point in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed concert in Glasgow due to illness of Alex Turner
The Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after their vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was due to perform at the city's Hydro concert venue on Friday.
However, vocalist Alex Turner's illness forced them to postpone the show.
The statement was made after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to move the show to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical attention, the Arctic Monkeys are also due to postpone the show at the Hydro venue in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and is unfortunately unable to perform."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show in Glasgow at the Hydro venue will take place on November 21.

Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will raise new cardinals to the Catholic Church for the first time in his term of office on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the popes, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope - this is the prerogative of a group of 120 "electoral cardinals".
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that a meeting of all current cardinals, known as the consistory, would be held before the inauguration ceremony.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal voters is likely to decline by February.
He said it is customary for the pope to name as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinal electors back to 120, as well as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
The consistory next year will make a big difference because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
They will also be the first elected cardinals since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with seeking ways to reform the church.
In the past, my dad made his own decisions.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “very possible” that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before - this is all for us for the first time.
Valero said that the popes usually raised the cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he’ll name.”
GM recalls a number of new pickups in the United States to refine the seat backs
General Motors Co. is recalling nearly 19,000 all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to address issues with manually adjustable backrest tilts, according to a notice from U.S. vehicle safety regulators on Friday.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the back tilt mechanism.
As a result, the seat backs do not meet the federal safety standards for head restraints.
“When a car is hit from behind, the head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a notice posted on its website.
The recalled models were manufactured in the period from August 1 to September 10.
The launch of GM pickup trucks began in June and represents the most important launch of the car into serial production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider notifying owners due to the government’s 16-day shutdown, which reduced car sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, which were upgraded for the 2014 model year, grew by about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickup trucks and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon rose by 1.4 percent to $37.47.
The Cries of Obama’s Voter
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change.
He says Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to nullify the laudable effort.
Obstructionism Cannot Justify Problems With Obama’s Reformed Healthcare Website, Drone Attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in my second year of medical school, and give me a sense of hope.
It’s called “Courage to Win,” and it’s a memoir of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing my patient reports in the evening and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches were breathtaking.
The election victory was impressive, and news anchors paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents were guarding every newspaper they could find.
A young team of strategists was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his support rate was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a rough awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember those days of optimism – they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, the changes have really happened.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” rule, the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the ability to choose public health care, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But after countless times I’ve been on the side of the Obama administration, defending it to colleagues and peers, I’ve run out of explanations that I can provide.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain the permission to wiretap foreign leaders or drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on Americans’ privacy by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of whistleblowers who expose government misconduct.
He cannot explain the murder of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial and investigation, or the failure to comply with the limits of state funding and spending during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the findings of the report, which says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And lately, he can’t justify not being able to develop a simple website for more than three years after signing the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that leadership can contradict the political campaigns that precede it?
Obviously, working in an elected position is not a predictable program of action, since our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and such random events as the Newtown massacre.
Nonetheless, all of the examples I have cited above show that they were largely the administration's own choice.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and crude alternative, he seemed unable to make decisions about his own policies or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard about for so long.
However, when Obama’s rating dropped below 45% this week, it became much harder to go back to 2008 with this book.
It makes me long for a lot of promises that have gone away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton inflicted a deafening defeat on Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At the failure analysis meeting, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain true to their goal.
“I want us to regain our attractiveness,” he said.
We have to remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of childcare leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over childcare leave because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who has an unresolved dispute over paying a $6 million carbon tax, made the statement at a time when he was trying to shy away from questions about whether he had a conflict.
Palmer’s United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding to abolish carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest, and said Mr. Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the policy measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid childcare leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they get leave or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the 53-vote contest for a seat from the Sunshine Coast constituency of Fairfax.
Mr. Palmer called for a revision of the electoral counting procedure to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should the decision on this election be made two months after we voted?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have a system where you can come in, enter your data into the computer, vote right away and get the result at 6:30 that same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of ballot pencils.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn’t like it?
Using a pencil seems strange these days.
The Electoral Commission is exploring opportunities for e-voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Palmer said his program includes an international airport for Sunshine Coast and he would take his new job "very seriously".
Public office involves service to society.
“We seek no rewards other than history’s gratitude for being able to serve this district at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division, according to two people familiar with the situation, further confirming that global scrutiny by regulators of alleged currency market manipulation is gaining momentum.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world’s largest financial market, whose daily turnover is $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended in an unfolding investigation that echoes the LIBOR interbank rate manipulation scandal.
Refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank said in a statement two weeks ago.
Last month, insiders said RBS handed over email and instant messaging records received and sent by its former trader to the UK’s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave of absence in his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr. Usher’s instant messaging contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to knowledgeable individuals.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators around the world — the European Commission, Finma, Swiss antitrust authority Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are reviewing allegations that bankers colluded to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started internal audits or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks have been reviewing instant messages and emails for several years in search of offenses.
The news of the inspections has stirred up traders in the sphere of activity, which in recent years has been one of the largest sources of income of the trading divisions of investment banks, which, however, this year faced difficulties due to the fact that low currency volatility reduces favorable opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation by saying that an extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their internal platforms means that “you can start to influence the market for a very small price.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired one of the traders in its London Stock Exchange trading department this week after it caused nearly $6 million in losses late last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the relevant authorities and cooperate with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue has been localized,” Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Healthcare Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that Barack Obama’s landmark health care law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By voting 5 to 4, the judges ruled that separate ordinances under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine are constitutional under the government’s tax authority.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were against.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of that 2,700-page law and further ruled that the requirement of the health law that states increase Medicaid compliance otherwise they would lose all federal Medicaid funding was not unconstitutionally enforceable.
The lawsuit against the bill was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was vehemently opposed by every major Republican presidential candidate during the 2012 primary season, including alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football - the cause of discord?
In the State Duma in the framework of the “Open Tribune” politicians and experts talked about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was this: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game - only scandals and discord.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that to reduce the "degree of tension in society" politics and the media should be correct in their statements.
Perhaps he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire, if they do not want to limit the birth rate.
All speakers also spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion a turmoil.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev are “a model conflict that could have been predicted”, but “we have too many people and authorities answering for these questions”, and seven nurses have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced in relation to migrants, has failed, according to the publicist, and it is necessary to find its own way.
Historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes on a new unified history textbook.
"We still need to create a manual on the history of culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal responsibility for “calls for the dismemberment of Russia”: “If in the United States to say on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!”
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to “instigate”.
As usual, he blamed journalists who bring sick and acute national problems to public discussion: "In the heat of controversy, there is little to say!"
The leader of the United Russia faction, Vladimir Vasiliev, immediately advised journalists to conclude a “charter” and agree to conduct talks on this topic carefully, and then politicians can assume the same obligations.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order as a whole has been established, Mr. Vasilyev said.
As an example, he cited a law that holds regional and municipal authorities accountable for inter-ethnic peace on their territory.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm about this law: it does not have “clear ideas about what migration adaptation is, about its mechanisms and limits.
Therefore, the subjects will treat the scope of these powers differently.
In addition, municipalities do not have the personnel necessary to solve such complex issues, there are no funds, and the methodological recommendations that they could use, the center does not give them.
The head of the Duma Committee on nationalities Hajimet Safaraliev proposed to create a special agency with the formidable name "Ministry of national security", which would deal with issues of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 90s headed a similar agency, abolished later, opposed.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, a "minister without a portfolio", to whom you could turn, if anything.
“We are walking around the edge, shells are bursting next to each other, it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work should receive decent information support,” said the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church for relations with society, Vsevolod Chaplin.
No state neutrality in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, should, in his opinion, be.
Here Oleg Nilov led the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan need to be looked for, but they are pushed on the wrong path, on the wrong road," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "Then the football player is beaten by the whole crowd, then the flags are burned, then the comrades throw stones at each other ...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There is another sport called rugby.
"There will be no equals in the world in this sport!" - said Zavoross ardently.
In rugby in the Caucasus no one will play! - immediately intervened Mr. Zhirinovsky.
You will offer them more curling!
You need to know the national characteristics, it's like Georgian "Zaporozhets" to offer"...
In Yaroslavl, representatives of the Moscow club distinguished themselves by wild behavior on the podiums - during the game with a local club.
Football should be banned across the country.
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the RFU, Artur Grigoryants, said that "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles, reports from the House of football correspondent "SE" Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for burning the flag of Dagestan by fans on the podium during the home match of the 14th round against Anzhi.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFPL.
We have examined all available materials.
For improper behavior of the audience "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, which it broke at an auction for Nortel’s bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, has filed patent infringement lawsuits in a U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of infringing seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match online search keywords to relevant ads, the lawsuit says, which is the backbone of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones running the Android operating system from Google, which competes fiercely with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google raised the price several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in this transaction the determining factor was partly the patent library of Motorola.
“Despite an unsuccessful attempt to acquire at auction the patents that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has infringed and continues to infringe them,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is demanding increased damages from Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is intentional, according to the claim.
Egypt sworn in as first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi is sworn in, but the day of his triumph is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he took the oath of office, becoming the country’s first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years of existence has been a banned organization that has served as a target for harsh actions by successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Morsi arrived with a small convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike the Mubarak-era presidential pump, traffic was halted for only a short time to let his convoy pass along the normally busy road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Although mocked as a non-charismatic “spare wheel” of the Brothers, Morsi’s personal prestige has risen dramatically since his victory and Friday’s performance in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists but for all those who want to bring to an end the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wooden paneled hall where he took the oath.
Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with the army orchestra, performing the national anthem, during which he stood on the stand "peacefully".
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was greeted by the slogan "Army and people - one hand", which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath Friday in Tahrir Square, where an uprising broke out that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and promised to regain the presidency, which had been stripped of his office by a military council that took cases from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take a formal oath before a court rather than parliament, as is customary, he is fulfilling the military’s will, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen region was held on the basis of the Yalutorovsky Automobile Plant.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of welded steel pipes was presented.
According to the commercial director of the enterprise, Denis Gribanov, in 2011 with the appearance of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted to study the market of sales of steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electrically welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for its production.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of products were shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new plant was launched, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small pipe profile, which is used for private households, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the production level of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will make up about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase in staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is undergoing retraining, and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new unit of longitudinal cutting of steel with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another mill, with a pipe production rate of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes that are used in housing and communal services.
The management of the enterprise sets the task to cover up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region for these products.
Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is also aimed at forms of state support for industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its leasing.
This year, it is envisaged to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider subsidy contracts, accepts documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For next year, the budget provides for funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million for energy saving programs.
Reduced to 72 million rubles for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future this form of support will cease, since the motive for its introduction was the compensation of the tax on mining, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so, and subsidies become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
In view of this, the regional government prioritizes direct support for industrial enterprises, rather than financing the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be related to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the evolving situation with oil workers.
The subsidy for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage of the industry in the south of the Tyumen region, and if it is cancelled, it will be difficult to compete with the price of the middle lane of Russia, where the labor force is cheaper.
In addition, the issue of the continuity of the new owner of TNK-BP - the company "Rosneft", which has not yet placed its orders at the enterprises of Tyumen.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uwat project expires in 2013, and no application for its renewal has been received.
Currently, enterprises in the south of the region that specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector cannot form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains whether taxes on oil produced in the Uvatsky district will be paid to the region's budget or will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomic will work 240 hours for an extremist video in the social network
The Leninsky district court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory work a resident of the city, who posted on the social network a video of extremist orientation, a representative of the press service of the regional court told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted on his page in the popular social network video, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was opened against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation “Acts aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as to humiliate the dignity of a person committed in public”.
"The Leninsky district court considered this case in a special order and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime, imposing a penalty of 240 hours of mandatory work," the source said.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in prices for goods after the signing of the association with the European Union
Prime Minister of Ukraine Nikolay Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will decrease significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, among which there are, among others, customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the free trade area, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
This will mean that prices will also fall.
"This concerns goods coming from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
But there shouldn’t be any price increases either.
Therefore, messages on billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is an increase in prices, this is not quite so, or, to be more precise, not so at all," Azarov said.
Investigators verify information about child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, the media published a report that a teacher of one of the kindergartens in the city of Biysk had locked a child in the basement for educational purposes.
At present, investigators are clarifying all the circumstances, as well as a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten employees.
After the accusation in the durnovkusiya Evgenia Vasilyeva spoke
Evgenia Vasilieva, who has been closely watched by the media for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press about both theft in the Ministry of Defense and about her personally - relations with former Minister of Defense Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and her addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, the defendant in the case of "Oboronservice" broke silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: "Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to extract from me any negative information about the former Minister of Defense."
There was blackmail for me to testify or I'd go to jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, we prove our innocence.
We are 100% sure of victory.
At the same time, from the interview, we can conclude that, perhaps, Vasiliev was most affected by the words that she does not care with taste.
Probably, it refers to the statement of the official representative of the IC of the Russian Federation Vladimir Markin that in the collection of paintings, which was collected by the defendant in the case of “Oboronservisa”, there were fakes.
Among the arrested property are a number of paintings that the owner, confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art history examination appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings has established that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap fakes,” Markin said at the beginning of October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they still admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, while they said that I have bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my tastes, to discuss any personal moments?
In my opinion, this is just indiscriminate," Vasilyeva says.
Asked whether she admitted her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes attributed to her, Vasilyeva said: "Naturally, no.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
They just mislead people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement of the IC of the Russian Federation that Vasilyeva avoids studying the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the defendant said that he and his client "the investigator does not allow to get acquainted with the materials of the case."
What was the reason for the revelations of Vasilyeva, who was under house arrest and still did not communicate with the press?
Perhaps as a woman, she couldn't help but respond to the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the journalists of Komsomolka right, who claimed a couple of days ago that she “came into an even greater trance under house arrest” because of the news of Anatoly Serdyukov’s reconciliation with his wife and his return to the bosom of the family?
Victor Baranets, a well-known military observer of the KP, wrote in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?": "Investigators do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more talkative during interrogations."
Earlier, Vasilyeva took on some accusations of illegal sale of real estate by the Ministry of Defense.
The pre-winter trouble.
What to do in the garden before frost
From fungicides in the fall, it is better to choose copper-containing preparations, for example, a 1% Bordeaux mixture or preparations Abiga-Peak, Oxyhom, Ordan, etc.
Do you think travel agents are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
At Flight Centre, the trend seems to be reversed.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel firm now expects its main total annual pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared to its previous forecast of between $305 million and $315 million.
If current benchmarks are reached, this would be a 12–17 percent increase compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre made 8% of profit in the first half of the year and started the second half with good performance, especially on weekly trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits for our 10 countries, and for some of them, a record high profit before interest and tax contributions is expected for a full year,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting the somewhat weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure business went well, while corporate customers spent less.
Its U.S. business has offset losses during the seasonally weak first half and is expected to make a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20.
On October 31, the Barnaul police discovered two game halls.
The first worked in the Industrial district on Vzletnaya Street.
There was a game going on at the time of the check-up.
There were 24 guns in the club.
Another gaming club was found in the Leninsky district on Anton Petrov street.
20 slot machines were used here.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been compiled under the article “Illegal organization and conduct of gambling”.
Tech was seized.
In the near future, materials on these facts will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Leninsky districts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, the criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who brutally dealt with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, the day before in the Kirov district of the Ural capital, after the fire was extinguished in a three-room apartment located in a residential building on Uralskaya Street, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found.
Soon the identities of the deceased were established.
It turned out that these are sisters, one of them is a resident of Yekaterinburg for 44 years, the second is a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
The burnt-out apartment was rented a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under the personal control of the chief police officer of the region Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs bodies are practicing different versions of the murder, verifying the alibi of previously tried citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it establishes for what purpose women rented an apartment, and where they lived before that, what they did, with whom they maintained relationships.
Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School English literature courses will require students to study at least one play of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction since 1914.
The exam will also feature “extracurricular texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate language final exam, with strong recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due to release new English and Mathematics curricula tomorrow, the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
It will make changes to other major subjects next year.
Separately, the regulatory body in the field of exams OFQUAL will present a revised structure of secondary school final exams, with a new system of assessments and less coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was “a broad consensus that we need to reform our exam system to restore public trust,” insisting that school graduation exams would be “more challenging, more ambitious, and more stringent.”
Studies show that English schools devote less time to math (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, while in Singapore, students take about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on the math schedule, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school math graduation exams combined with an elevated score on the ranking table would likely serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional training on the subject.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-life tasks”, including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2 200 rubles
From tomorrow, from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe, tourists will begin to carry boats on an airbag.
For those who want to travel to China, this means extra expenses.
A ticket for a cougar is traditionally much more expensive than for a ship.
As reported in the reference service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of an ordinary ticket will be 2 200 rubles.
Passage through the hall of increased comfort will cost 2 800 rubles.
By the way, this season tickets did not rise in price: at the same price cougars carried tourists and last spring, and a year ago - in the fall.
Dmitry Medvedev: Russia’s GDP growth rate is insufficient for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that Russia’s GDP growth rate is insufficient and believes that the situation can be improved by simplifying business lending conditions and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation.
We planned to grow GDP around 3% this year, maybe even a little more.
It will actually be less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of the recession in a number of European countries, it seems not very bad, but for us it is not enough, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher pace.
Now it is very important that Russian companies and Russian businesses receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing that must be done," the head of government stressed.

A trip through mud, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bvelle provides free health care in rural Cameroon
Bwell and his team spend almost every weekend taking in hundreds of patients.
In this West African country, there are not many doctors — only one in 5,000 people
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bvelle is one of the 10 main characters of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to make him a CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bvelle saw his father come back to life and again fall unconscious, wandering through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bvelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that resembled him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bvelle.
If we had the money, we would have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving whatever treatment they could get.
“It’s not easy,” Bwell said.
You can leave home at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation hasn’t changed much since Bwell’s father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them would be out of pocket.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s healthcare spending is private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
“And because of poverty, they can’t enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bvelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bvelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 other people are stuffed into vans, tie medical supplies to rooftops, and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.
They are not always lucky.
More than once they had to push cars across rivers and dirt.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like real heroes: it’s a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms the locals have to offer.
The free medical care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Bvelle with its wide smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the team starts taking in hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on every trip,” Bvelle said.
They come from all over the county within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches, donated points, or free birth certificates—documents required for school that many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually done in a school building, municipality or home; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-surgery area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the operating and sanitation equipment, Bvelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It’s an unbearable pace, but the dedication of the brigade usually helps support the village musicians.
“They’re drumming all night to keep us awake and working,” Bvelle said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade are sent back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students, has conducted 700 free surgeries over the past year and they know that their help can make a huge difference to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia surgery he received would allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” he said.
In addition to these weekend clinics and hospital work, Bwelle also works at night in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this second work, he said, that provides 60% of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest of the funds are covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in Bwell’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to earn money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses like O’Malley coming from the U.S. and Europe to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, this is an opportunity of practice that they would never have gotten at home.
“We got the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold instruments for Dr. Bwell,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year student, you would never have had such an opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But upon arrival in Yaoundé, their meals, transportation and training are paid for by Bvelle.
“He’s a hero, no doubt,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bvelle, an almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
Helping others to live happily, keeping their father’s promise is what brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle said.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh, to relieve their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see how you can help.
Snowden agrees to testify about Merkel’s wiretapping
Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the conversation, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the Prosecutor General's Office of Germany in the case of possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor's phone by U.S. special forces.
Snowden said he was willing to testify.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear," said Hans-Christian Ströbele, "that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first you need to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival. .
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the U.S. spyware scandal.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Department of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated to journalists by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Makei at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, BelTA correspondent reports.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the public authorities of the two countries will provide ubiquitous assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts with each other," said Vladimir Makei.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus will create all necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The minister also said that the 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission was held in Ankara, following which the protocol was signed.
The parties have developed a roadmap for Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in the trade, economic and investment fields, in the fields of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as the search for new forms and directions of cooperation.
"The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners," he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that at the talks, the foreign ministers of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
According to the Minister, the trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey should be increased and brought to the level of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the sphere of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, since there is untapped potential in this area, he believes.
There have always been very warm relations between our countries, and we hope that in the future they will be further strengthened and expanded.
All necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic ties and for the successful work of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey,” said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama Rejects His Health Care Words
In a storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday stepped back on his often-repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receive notices of termination from their service providers, Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama somewhat tweaked his initial public promise.
“Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called a “news revival” over the shutdown, Obama urged Americans receiving the notifications to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
“You will get better conditions,” he said.
The administration said it should come as no surprise that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required by the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me tell these Americans straight: you deserve better,” Sibelius said in a speech to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online sales platform has been “horribly bad” since October.
“I’m upset and angry just like everyone else,” she said.
I want to regain your trust.”
Annoyed, Sibelius dropped the phrase, which was caught on the microphone by an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday’s hearing in the House after a heated debate with House Speaker Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she herself should join Obama’s health program.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to tell why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which it is now imposing on millions of Americans.
Agency "Rosbalt" deprived of the status of the media for obscene warfare
On October 31, the Moscow City Court decided to invalidate the license for the registration of the Rosbalt agency.
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the media agency of its status for systematic and gross violations of the law on media.
During the process, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, effectively refusing the publication the right to put forward counterarguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
CJSC Rosbalt News Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
The agency also has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has been developing and functioning as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency’s exclusive publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Discussions about the proximity of the publication to the law enforcement agencies continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Along with the fact that "Rosbalt" had an extensive database of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions and said that the head of the project was Natalia Chaplina - wife of Viktor Cherkesov.
At the same time, Chaplin’s role in the leadership of Rosbalt is not completely clear: most often she is called the “project leader”.
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolay Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not appeared in the ratings of the federal media - neither in terms of citations nor in terms of audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the ranking of visits to Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials over the past five months are notes about the Kremlin’s helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group “King and the Fool”, the pogroms in the capital Biryulev.
Rosbalt’s conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the law on the media came into force, forbidding journalists from obscene brawl.
The agency found banned vocabulary in two videos published on the agency's website ("Jigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot desecrated oil towers").
The other sides describe it differently.
Roskomnadzor on the basis of the discovered videos accused “Rosbalt” in a gross and systematic violation of the law on the media and appealed to the court with a request to withdraw the license from the agency.
Rosbalt claimed that the agency’s claims were unlawful: firstly, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, the mother words in them were disguised, and thirdly, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor’s claims to the world court – and when on October 22, 2013, the Moscow City Court accepted Roskomnadzor’s claim, the consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, already on the 25th, the world judge made a decision not in favor of Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offences and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow City Court - if we abandon the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate the certificate of registration of Rosbalt, effectively depriving the agency of the status of the media.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt was alone in this confrontation.
The Agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (a statement addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was filed at the initiative of the Communist Party).
The illegality of the closure of the publication was stated by the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Human Rights Council Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even gave him some guarantees that the revocation of the license will not come.
The trial of “Rosbalt” showed: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be a mass media in Russia today is a big question.
Syria Destroys Chemical Weapons Equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has recognized.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by Damascus one day ahead of schedule.
By November 1, Syria was supposed to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities intended for the preparation of military poisonous substances for use.
The destruction of stockpiles of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, poisonous substances are currently in sealed storage.
International inspectors traveled to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on Aug. 21.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time – not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more chemical weapons – and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians should agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing stockpiles of poisonous substances.
There are a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence services.
They will readily advise the inspectors of new facilities for inspection, if there is reason to suspect that Damascus is not completely frank.
The United States believes that this shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached through the mediation of Russia, destroy or put out of service all capacities for the production of shells, poisonous gases and liquids and for the filling of shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has passed, the next step should be to destroy the already existing chemical weapons of the Syrian army.
It is assumed that this arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, skin-explosive mustard gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozen different places.
To destroy it, it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a timetable for action, which takes two weeks.
OPCW field operations chief Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors had “personally observed the destruction of the equipment.”
"They now have no possibility to continue producing or mixing chemical weapons," he said.
In a statement, the OPCW said that inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and were convinced that the plants for the production of shells and poisonous substances were either destroyed or rendered unusable.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to be inspected there, the document said, but the equipment was transported and inspected by OPCW experts.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was "particularly difficult", as it had to work in the conditions of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said there was still no time for the inspectors to celebrate — they were too busy working.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage “has gone inappropriately far”
John Kerry has demonstrated a softening of U.S. surveillance protection tactics by making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. espionage “has gone inappropriately far.”
The secretary also pleaded guilty, along with Barack Obama, to being “on autopilot” at the time of Edward Snowden’s high-profile revelations about NSA espionage activities.
These leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, actually perceived some of the things happening on autopilot because such an opportunity already existed – both during World War II and during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and of course, September 11th.”
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one’s rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it has gone unbelievably far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to the people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted in good faith and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow up people and attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We were actually preventing plane crashes, building explosions and killing people because we were able to know about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. espionage abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint counterterrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned by their threats to end their involvement in anti-terrorism organizations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“It is really important for U.S. national security interests that Europeans remain our supporters with regard to our common anti-terrorism efforts,” Murphy, a first-term Democrat who chairs the Senate’s international affairs subcommittee on European affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
“And I’m going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.”
News that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency’s head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the U.S.
Other disclosures cited documents released by Snowden that showed that the NSA was monitoring the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of about 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended allied espionage as necessary and said it was common practice on both sides.
Against the backdrop of this uproar, Murphy said his office is organising a trip by members of Congress that is expected to take place this year, and that he hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of the other legislators involved should be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still under development.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to promote better relationships, he said some degree of “best-intentioned hardness” would also be displayed.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what spyware they themselves have used for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to accept the fact that we are not the only ones doing intelligence,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is due to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address hostility to U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
The influence of jailers will increase in the new compositions of public supervisory commissions
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new compositions of public monitoring commissions (ONC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
NPCs are public bodies that control the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozhaev, the unrest in the Kopek colony - it is through the ONC that most of the resonant incidents behind bars are publicized.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and lobbyists of the security forces for control of the ONC.
At the meeting of the working group of the OP on the formation of the ONC, I proposed to make the experience of human rights activities a criterion for selection.
"He was not accepted, and formed lists without developing criteria," says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, an all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison issues.
When he was a deputy of the State Duma from Yabloko, he drafted a law regulating the activities of the ONC.
The OP Council must vote on the compositions of the ONC in 43 regions of the country.
Fewer than a thousand applicants are applying for 1,800 vacancies, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria competitions could not be organized due to the lack of candidates.
The OC promises to organize a re-recruitment for vacancies.
The ONC of Moscow is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that in the new composition instead of 20 there will be 40 participants.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the capital commission, 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the version that is on the vote in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders were wanted in the capital commission.
But the new composition can again enter the representative of the "Fighting Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin.
He had been a member of the ONC for three years, but had never visited prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the security forces, by appointing their chairman of the ONC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so human rights defenders do not exclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
According to them, the promotion of the security forces is coordinated by the member of the ONC Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of law enforcement agencies.
"I don't eat babies on the trail," Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says he has no intention of preventing human rights defenders from visiting arrested opposition figures.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in what list is currently being voted on in the OP.
Borschev’s disclosure of information he considers a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of the leadership of the Chelyabinsk ONC.
Its former executives will be suspended due to last year's cope uprisings.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of the prisoners.
But the ONC of Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to security forces.
The human rights defender-chairman of the local commission “disappeared” from the new lists, but one of his opponents turned out to be, despite the fact that in May 2013 the federal Public Chamber expelled him for unethical behavior.
Borshchev considers the lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions to be “revenge for Kopeisk”.
The revelations of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect the ONC of Mordovia, which is considered a “force”: only one human rights activist wanted to get into the new composition, and she did not even accept documents for the competition.
Member of the OP Council Nikolai Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted in favour because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
The listing was coordinated by the Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, who is also an employee of the FSIN Research Institute.
Grib told RBC daily that he does not believe it is correct to divide the candidates for human rights defenders and security forces and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough powers to hinder the work of its members.
Mushroom is not taken to predict the results of the vote of the OP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended version will be put to a vote in the coming days.
Australian Woman Appeals Against Imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket for falsely claiming that she was attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on June 15 by the Phuket Provincial Court of filing a false lawsuit after Thai police reported that a local taxi driver carried out the attack on the night of Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
However, the CCTV footage later revealed that she returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in a general regime detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than an adult women’s prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who turned to the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was “extremely concerned” about their daughter’s well-being and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“Obviously, it was an alarming time, but we hope she will return home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her holidays in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to a court extending her sentence to two years and forcing her to serve time in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its undermined tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris for the presentation of his novel “Eltyshevs”, translated into French.
Recall that it was this novel that became the finalist of four awards: "Yasnaya Polyana", "Russian Booker", "National Bestseller" and "Big Book".
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded the award of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is the undoubted leader in the generation of current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prose writers.
Almost every publication of his rigid, based on modern life material stories and novels causes heated controversy among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that the combined articles on the prose and journalism of Senchin, reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In the discussions about the works of “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, according to the critic Sergey Chuprinin, it is mostly about the fact that its participants understand the word “literature”, as they see the present and the future of not only our literature, but also life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow it to include most articles and reviews from regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are given, as a rule, in abbreviations in the sections "Paragraphs..."
