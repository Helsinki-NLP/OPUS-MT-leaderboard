White bread, please.
White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black queen on h4 - mat! In chess circles this is jokingly called "stupid mat".
White: the boat on a1, the pawn on b6, the king on c8. Black: the pawns on a7 and b7, the king on a8, the elephant on b8. White put the opponent in the position of tsugzwang, putting the boat on a6, then the blacks have only two options: to take the boat on a6 and b6, or to move the b8 on any other field.
