Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they "look like mappets"
Some members of the assembly are astonished by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be a subject of ridicule.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who do not speak Welsh: in Welsh, twp means "foolish/crazy", and pwp means "like".
A Plaid member said the party as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said his party is "free-minded" about the name change, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "Muppet" is large.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
A committee of the National Assembly, which is currently preparing a law to introduce name changes, said: "The final decision on any words by which members of the Assembly will be appointed, of course, will be made by the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the commission announced the results of a public consultation on proposals indicating strong support for the appointment of the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
For the question of the name of the Members of Parliament, the committee prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from the public consultation.
Members of parliament are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could spark headaches for Assembly Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualifying members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will give the final vote on the question of their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was set in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells subsided as churches in Haarlem face problems
"Historically, the old people I talked to said there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
“Today, there is neither.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are socializing differently today," he said.
“Bars are no longer living rooms in neighborhoods where people go regularly.”
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as leaders think, "sooner or later, it will return to the same place where it started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the type of people who would not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The majority of people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and therefore the day these churches will be shut down completely will accelerate because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by White congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis—the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white-methodists moved away in the 1930s.
Congregation of Negroes practicing their faith nearby takes ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a congregation of blacks during the reign of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of vendors on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but since members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bell of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it a "cultural treasure" and an "indispensable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part brought by the inexpert leaders of the church, and part of the episcopal diocese.
The church board – the governing body of the church, made up of unprofessional leaders – wrote to the diocese in July worrying that the diocese would “request to transfer the costs” to the church board, even though the church board was not involved in hiring the architects and entrepreneurs the eparchy sent.
Some members of the parish complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy is injured in a lobster dive in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told San Diego's KSWB television that he was diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing to the group to help pull him out of the water.
Hamel stated that at first he thought it was the excitement of catching a lobster, but then "he realized he was yelling, 'He bit me!
He bit me!’
The whole collarbone was visible to him," Hamel said he noticed after reaching the boy.
“I called for everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported to be in critical condition.
It is not known what species of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gills, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but they decided the shark was not a dangerous species.
Gills said the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorized authorities closed the beach from the side of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Gills noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of department stores full of professional assistants.
As part of the UK's 2.8 billion pound-pound beauty market, which continues to grow as sales in fashion and households decline, large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be unveiled in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty emerged after supermarkets began looking for ways to use the shelf space that was once reserved for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup series, so most of the products are vegan-friendly, something that is increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Craidon, south London, last week, and the second one opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, director of Sainsbury’s, said stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has started placing Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which it says has boosted grocery sales and made shopping more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after a disagreement over how to share the profits from supermarket chemical stores.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury’s sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a must-have destination for the beauty that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Star Peter Jones of Dragons Den has left "furious" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their Truly brand for household products and accessories.
The couple’s business is related to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This 37-year-old morning host told Instagram she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, retiring from their lucrative branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new major deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when the television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m - meant she no longer had time to devote to their Truly brand for home products and supplements.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and has been said to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
As 37-year-old Willoughby told Instagram he was leaving Truly, Jones hurriedly left Britain for one of his cottages.
One source said: “Truly has always been at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would follow her in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all concerned caught them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell products."
Experts believe that leaving this morning’s host, which is one of Britain’s highest-paid stars, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in pillow and candlestick products, including clothing and household products, and the potential for further delays.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couples go on vacation together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand's ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We’re not commenting on his business exploits.”
A serious conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making comments that some would consider “unpresidential” and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump spoke in his voice disguised as a “news presenter.”
“I didn’t give up on anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North sees no “appropriate response” from the United States to North Korea’s early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
“We have a great relationship with North Korea,” he said.
“We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great partnership.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: missile tests ended, he helped free hostages, and the remaining U.S. troops returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we’re going to have 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, no natural disaster was declared, a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Due to earthquakes that constantly hit Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of times, traveling through many of Indonesia’s islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The main point in President Joko Widodo's election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds swept Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of next year's re-election.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other old weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starridge of Liverpool tied against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri passed the ball to Starridge about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1–0.
He moved the ball from the left side before pointing it at the distant tripod.
The ball moved high above the hexadecimal as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed through the jumped Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always passing as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible,” Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching and I just touched her and I didn’t think much about it and I was just kicking.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The striker of the "blue" pitched a heel back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in that attack, before kicking the ball almost halfway to the pitch, and then sprinted over to Liverpool's halves.
They quickly passed with Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in the middle of the field.
He then fired a missile, leading Hazard into the sixteenth.
Hazard passed the defense and finished in the net of the distant tripod with a left-footed kick next to Allison Becker at Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face the Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country’s disaster agency said on Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and caused waves 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was buried by a shotgun from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Moves on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohaghan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I would ask the people who were near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
“I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.”
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a facility.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, as the police said, they will inform the close people of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mows just tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him he was not allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would be hours before they could return.
Someone heard a police officer tell a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears.
She keeps saying, "It's so horrible."
At 2 a.m., two police vans were in the cordon, and another was outside.
Several police officers were standing in the cordon watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters on 0800 555 111 quoting record 247 dated September 30th.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament Becomes the Newest Memory Strike in History Rewriting Controversy
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclaste of the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thornecroft's beautiful Cromwell presentation is evidence of 19th-century thinking and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is completely accurate is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of commemoration.”
Pig Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, drenched in blood near a coffin at a market in Liupanshui province in southern China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to put vaccines on pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xinying, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found an open door from a neighboring pigsty.
He stated that there was a large boar with blood on his muzzle.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound boar ripped the farmer apart and killed him, according to the report.
“My cousin’s leg was bloody and torn,” said a cousin named Wu, according to a quote in Guyang’s evening news.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig had been locked up to prevent an attack on other people, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, earlier cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had stuck a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an “activator.”
“They’re just playing.”
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rose Will Bring Rain to Southwestern U.S.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves through the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, the Rose will bring floods of rain to northern Mexico and southwestern the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane from 5.00 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to bring large tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rose will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture with depression approaching will create heavy rainfall in the southeast over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden flooding, a flow of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause rainfall that in some places will be approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible due to rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is especially recommended not to go to the desert on foot in the possibility of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring locally plunging rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rains of more than half an inch in total are possible, which can be caused by rivers of rubble and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region since its wet season.
Occasional tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before the rains spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread in the "four corners" on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected across the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, but tropical areas remain high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A great example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost a 20 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with high temperatures at 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our forecast for a longer period suggests the possibility of above-average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States, up to the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavanaugh’s hearing.
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christina Blassie Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with speakers interrupting Friday’s regular turnaround programs at the last minute: Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, drew up a deal with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh was practicing piano and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it hadn’t happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen reported, watched it on Friday.
The company scored average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that featured it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people looking at offices.
To portray it better, it is an audience of a size similar to a playoff football competition or a film academy awards.
The Fox News channel, whose hosts strongly attacked Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued an announcement that he would vote for Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him on Friday morning as he tried to get into an elevator for a court committee hearing.
He stood there for a few minutes with his eyes down as he was being reprimanded, all of which were broadcast live on CNN.
"They're standing here in front of you," one woman said.
“Do you think he is telling the truth on earth?”
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door was closed, that he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks all covered hours later, when the Judicial Committee was due to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was a deal with the FBI to review the charges against the nominee next week, which was requested by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Koons, and several senators thereafter, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called “Checkers” Brexit plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the mutual costs is “completely absurd”.
Wade Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Diteon Simpson for Death of Louisiana State University Athlete
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
20-year-old Ditheon Simpson has been arrested and detained on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, a CBS partner told the WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the pathologist of the parish of eastern Baton Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for the assistance they provided in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of Louisiana State University thanked police for their "activity in the pursuit of justice."
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6.6-foot back grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 goals per game last season.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Simms' death.
“This is what you care about all the time,” the coach said.
Volcano throws ash on Mexico City
Ash eruptions from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached southern settlements in Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go near the volcano after activity began in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was followed by more rumblings and upheavals.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash on cars in populated areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen increased activity on the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police for public order and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of a polarizing vote to secede Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of the separatists detained by law and order police threw eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fights also broke out, and police used batons to suppress the fights.
For more than a few hours, independence groups shouted "No forgetting, no forgiving", while union protesters shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, the local press said.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region, a year after Madrid characterized the October 1 referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
A majority of voters voted in favour of independence, although turnout was low due to boycotts by people opposed to secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narcisse Termes, who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia has a chance of gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I watched my parents cry for joy because they can vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite winning a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders either in self-elected persecution or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, filming the protest in support of police, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting tougher,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders jailed before last year's trial, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after hitting car in house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly hitting a house in Londonbury.
The incident occurred in Balinagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said damage was caused to the gate and the building itself.
At some point, he may have been shot with a crossbow arrow at the car.
Menga's goal brought Livingston a 1-0 win against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
The upgraded Livingston captivated the Rangers by signing Steven Gerrard, with his only two losses in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal proved significant as Gary Hold's side climbed one level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side was left without a away win in the championship this season and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston have continued unbeaten in the division for six games, and coach Holt has not yet faced a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed an opportunity against the ruthless guests
Holt's team had to lead for a long time before they scored, and their directness caused a lot of trouble for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way, but dragged the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts from afar after sliding into Craig Halket's head shot over the goal.
Guests gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with their set actions.
And that’s how the goal came about.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together set up Menga, who just touched a goal from the center of the sixteenth.
Until then, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but could not break through the defense of the hosts, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not play for the most part.
This scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos succeeded in rescuing Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another set action at Livingston.
Livingston's sixteen-year-old was repeatedly crossed and defended, while two penalties requests - after Halket's challenge to replace Glenn Middleton and one to play by hand - were rejected.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont at BBC Scotland's Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to exceed the expectations of this uphill trail.
Their playing style and character barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hulkett was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Conor Goldson and Joe Voral on standby.
The Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
As good as they used to be under Gerard, they are now lagging behind by the same standards.
Their last game was weak – they only managed to open the hosts once – and that’s a bit of an awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Receives Mixed Reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have worsened due to problems including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also spoke out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposed protesters portray the divisiveness of the visitor famous as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city at about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The collision occurred a few months after the death of another cyclist in a car accident on Childers Street, where the driver fled, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been placed and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officers have been injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the prison's office said.
Riots broke out at the HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special forces from the Tornado unit were brought in to resolve the unrest, which includes eight prisoners and is confined to one wing.
Police officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel were assigned to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the police were summoned to the prison to deal with serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (may be useful for arid areas)
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but it’s likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rose’s remaining force sweeps through the desert’s southwestern region, bringing the risk of sudden flooding.
The state weather station has already issued warnings of possible flash floods for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Meteorological Station tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within a 200-mile range of Phoenix since 1950!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches at the edge of the Mongolian state of Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwestern region, including the central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated areas of up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas for sudden flooding, the Rose rain can be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial as the southwestern region is affected by drought.
“According to the United States Drought Monitoring Authority, nearly 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second highest category,” the agency said in a statement.
First, the path of Hurricane Rose led to landslides all over the Lower California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds of a maximum of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes into contact with cooler waters in the Pacific and is decreasing.
Therefore, rains are expected in Mexico with the severity of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected to rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain," weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah until late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rains in Lower California, southwestern Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States," the State Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening rapid flooding and debris flows, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsummer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and is in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police said if anyone had cell phone footage of the incident, they should step forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the greatest resentment and anger” of the Democratic Party.
“A vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s most brutal and scandalous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the greatest malice and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying allegations that Blassie Ford sexually assaulted her several decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Cavanaugh that day.
“The positive vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in early elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our time.
I’m not running, but I’m really fighting,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere and I’m fighting for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats have a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key vote for Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Senate is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and total death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed, many carried away by massive waves hitting beaches when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when 6-meter-high (18 ft) waves hit the shore at sunset, taking many to certain death and destroying everything on their way.
After the earthquake of magnitude 7.5, a tsunami struck.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB disaster mediation agency, in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it towed cars, trees, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coastline, could amplify the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the knock of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicentre of the quake.
Communications "were completely damaged without any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came around the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of a building can be heard shouting frenzied, warning people on the street downstairs of a tsunami approaching.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes into the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the recording.
The quake and tsunami caused a power cut that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened only for assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo planned to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The total death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees took refuge in tarpaulin shelters in their office yard, they walked through scenes of desolation along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses being destroyed," he said.
It's so bad.
Even as relief groups began grim attempts to start relief efforts for the disaster, some complained that foreign relief experts had been prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of the disaster has been declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn’t happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can receive international aid, but it still has no status.”
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been stuck under the shot for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's state paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon told how, when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began circulating in the paraglider community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray tick instead of a son.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while charging an ATM at Newport Harbor
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling up an ATM at Newport Harbor, according to a press release from Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car drained the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to replenish it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “runs from behind a Brink’s employee” and steals a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects fleeing the scene, according to a statement, but police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changed His Name to Jey
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Jey.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West wore the nickname Yay for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change took place just before his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who had to cancel for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has previously said the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yeah' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and it means 'you' there," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, I am you, I am us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only, to Yea alone, the reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West associate Jay-Z also uses his name with or without a dash and all uppercase letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military on civilians
Mexico’s Vice President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
The military shot peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly aid to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double its research funding in the field, said AI developer and practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. has no formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: aiming to be number 1 in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the AI budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of AI will be made by the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of China's Sinovation+ Ventures, an AI company that invests in one of the world's most successful companies.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American otelo player, and later served as director at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee thanked for previous competitions on U.S. government technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would be in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhDs in artificial intelligence,” he said.
The State Council of China issued its Plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s state-run Natural Sciences Foundation funds people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an Authorized Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the creation of a National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission has been dormant for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its bids for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies like the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Gjorgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout stood at 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I came out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave their vote in the referendum in Macedonia to change the country’s name, which will open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, on September 30, 2018 in Strumica.
Before the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small stage and chairs in front of tents set up by people who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not from the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
The poll, published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma showed that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent will vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout should be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero at Manchester City passes all of Brighton's defense by goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly defeated Brighton in a 2–0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He quickly passed between Brighton's three defensive players before entering the open court.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four "greens".
Bypass one defensive player before running a few others to the edge of Brighton's sixteenth.
He then passed to the left of him, to Sterling.
The English striker used his first coming to the 16th to regain the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with his right foot, with a single hit to the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We played 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to get a goal at the time.”
But the initial advantage of the "sky blues" gave Sterling in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful straight ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before leading Sterling to the distant tripod.
The Sky Blues attacked the ball into the net before it went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a group match of the Champions League at 12.55am on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar Arena, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a spoiler against Rockys
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who lead with one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies team had at least a "joker" for a place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
“Although we’re not playing for anything, at least we can throw in knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level of any moment I’m going to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals are still due to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start for the 34th time, practiced throwing on Thursday and will throw normally rested on Sunday.
Washington’s right-wing is 18–7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout points in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding his election of Brett Cavanaugh to the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in early elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks until one of the most important elections of our time.
“This is one of the big ones, big ones – I’m not running, but I’m really fighting, so I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
“You see these horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what’s going on right now.
And they are determined to regain their power using all the means at their disposal, you see the malice, the insolence.
They don’t care who they hurt, when they have to run over in order to gain power and control, that’s what they want power and control, but we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and obstruct".
“And you’ve been seeing that for the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, mean, ugly, and untruthful.”
He mentioned Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, appointed by the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, to which the audience responded with shouts of resentment.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, what.
No, no, no, wait a minute – that was very bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Laboratories no longer accept different opinions.
It is not tolerated by those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last in line of Labour MPs to be told that we are not welcome – just because he is expressing his opinion.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she took a firm stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of the East Labor Party in Nottingham stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a member of the Labor Party parliament, Friday night council meetings were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a “milder, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if indeed it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different opinions are not tolerated within the Labor Party, and each opinion is judged whether it is acceptable to the party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I felt we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to completely change my thinking and take positions that I would never have taken otherwise, whether it was for national security or for the internal affairs of the EU.
Whenever I speak in public, and it really doesn’t matter what I say, there’s critical harassment on social media that calls for condemnation, denial of the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labor Party.
I’m not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because comments directed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist bullying every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labor Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions, and with every request for “no confidence” or change of selection rules, the party becomes narrower opinions.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not be so loud, and then “everything will be fine.”
But that’s not why I came into politics.
Even 32 years ago, when I joined the Labor Party as a student, provoked by Thatcher’s government’s negligence that literally left my classroom collapsing, I struggled to improve public services for those most in need, whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported Friday’s demand, all I want to say is that when the country is pushing towards Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labor Party leader.
But I have a message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labor Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how deplorable threats or political opportunism I survive, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament for East Nottingham.
Ear 38 – 17 Melrose: the undefeated Ear goes to the top
The two late points may have altered the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderfully entertaining match of the day of the Scottish Rugby Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as their improved exploited chances, which took the home team, and coach Peter Murci has the right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested through our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Thank you for the Air, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute point, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Ear an advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for Warriors' game, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted point.
Klimo delayed Ear's lead with a penalty, earlier, exactly in the half, he scored a point, so he converted a solo point to score 17–5 for Ear in the rescue.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Andresson's point, converted by Baghot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Noth, who was carried out on a stretcher, and from the reset, Ear continued to struggle with the point of Stafford McDowall, converted by Klimo.
Air's VD-captain, Blair McPherson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for the extra man with an unconverted point to Bruce Colvin at the end of the time with relentless pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Klima without the ball, McPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty kick line at the back of Ear's sharp attack.
Klimo converted, as he did again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's shot and sent wingman Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
‘Still Game’ star looks ready for new restaurant career
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears poised to move into the hospitality industry after it was revealed he had been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-starred with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be their last, and it appears that Kearnan is planning for a post-Craiglang life.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source said Kearnan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant business".
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia surrounded by land hopes court will reopen path to Pacific
Sailors patrol a disguised naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are moulded with the motto: “The sea is ours rightfully.
It is our duty to return.”
Throughout mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the longing to navigate the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes may now be the highest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a decision by an international court on October 1 after five years of hearings.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and calm and of course expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the international court's ruling on the big screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of volatile talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant it a sovereign outlet to the sea of Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also depends heavily on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia’s favor and that it will not change much even to rule in their favor.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to allocate territory to Chile and said it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
That the international court’s verdict comes just six months after the final arguments indicate that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And the past four years may have set back the cause of Bolivia instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales’ bellicose rhetoric undermined Chile’s remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision is unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Kalsadia also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the sea problem as a political backing.
“Bolivia will never relinquish its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was “fictional” to believe that prolonged sanctions and U.S. objections to a declarative end to the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal the Latest Line of Massive Hats on Their Way to the Biggest Stores Near You
If you want to improve the size of your hat collection or completely block the sun, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of crazy oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats launched Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their creations that fall in the eye on the runway.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide rim in the form of feathers that flooded the model's head.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons with zircons, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sutured lips and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving equipment completely with glasses and a dive tube, and the other looked like a melted cornet of ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're in luck.
Followers of the style predict that huge hats can come to the stores near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after La Bomba, a two-foot-wide straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic fashion house behind the too impractical hat that spread across social media sent another big creation down the track, a straw beach bag nearly the size of the height of the model it was pulling.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia border and a white leather handle, was the piece that stood out in Jacques's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in stores next summer, because the designer has caused such a huge impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for too large accessories."
John Edward: linguistic skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam scores, which is only amplified by individual and group success in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement tailored school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desired as an elective in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it will make him arrogant.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will strike him in the soul.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can observe that languages outperform all other subjects with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher score of "5+".
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students scored higher "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French, and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also scored "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages are now, as an elective, seen at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school curricula as well as elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the Commission on Employment and Skills of the OK noted that 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for failure to fill jobs were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs demanding languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polyglot an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to talk, and French was the only language spoken by more than ten percent, or 15 percent of people.
Therefore, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in OK when looking into the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be numerous languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
At present, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this must be replicated in schools.
In fact, modern languages really should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
"Il faut bien le faire" (it must be done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will lead the Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first game of the pre-season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he plays is still uncertain.
“There will be more than one and fewer than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule ahead of the Lakers season.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
YouTube channel for Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump has launched a series of rallies as part of his campaign, tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled next week, including visits to leaning places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While a vote to confirm his election to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court is stalled, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans could lose control of Congress with a vote in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. East Coast Time Zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia via the internet live on YouTube.
This week, Trump is likely to address the hearing of the man nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, which has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected delay of a Senate vote to a week as the FBI investigates.
The primary goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November election.
Hence, President Trump’s campaign said the five rallies next week were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the start of a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, the rally tonight could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro news.
Saturday marks Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in a month, a country he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican senator Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in polls.
"It's not good for Morrissey that the president has to come to improve the popularity of polls," said Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Cup Rider 2018: The U.S. team showed courage in the fight to keep hope alive at the start of the individual games on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, Saturday afternoon fours may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The twist of luck is a completely invented sporting concept, but the players really believe in it, and most of all in such matches.
Who do you think happiness is now?
“They had a six-point lead and now they’re four, so we’re a bit lucky, I guess,” Jordan Spitt said after the competition ended.
Europeans have an advantage, of course, a lead of four points and twelve more games.
Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in the sails, although they have enough incentive, if nothing else, then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Sleep was great and lead by example.
Those strong shouts of celebration grew stronger throughout his game, with a key stroke leading to a four-four leveling when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His shot to win the 15-year-old's game was greeted with a similar shout, one that tells you that he believes the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to go deeper and take care of your game," Spit said.
That’s all that’s left for every player.
18 holes to score a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but beautiful duo of Europe are four out of four and can’t go wrong.
"Mollywood were the only couple without bad punches on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bad punches on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensure that they are the players who will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players who will secure a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf National, except Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Talks about European fame, however, remain unjustified.
Beetle Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of double pairs, when he merged with Alex Noren.
A blowout and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Doubles and quads are so fascinating to watch from up close because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give each other, the advice they disobey, and the way the strategy can change all at once.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved a significant lead on the last day, but the quadruple season also showed that the US team can fight even though some, especially the Americans, doubted.
The Europeans led 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enter with a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's lead in doubles and fours from 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far at Le Golf Nacional by four points.
Thomas Björn's European team, which fought to keep the trophy he lost at Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team, which had many misses in the morning doubles and won the series 3-1.
The Americans put up more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but could not reach the lead.
Jim Fourik's team needs eight points out of 12 individual games a week to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair ever to score four points in the first four games of Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in doubles, they played great and defeated worn-out Woods and American rookie Bryson Deschambou with an even more pronounced 5&4 score.
Woods, who made it through two matches on Saturday, played great at times, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in doubles and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested while the morning doubles lasted, returned as partner to Henrik Stenson in the quadruples with a 2&1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
The Europeans, however, did not enjoy that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, the three-time winners, set a two-point benchmark for Americans on Saturday.
They scored a decisive 2&1 win over the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the doubles and returned later to beat Pulter and Rory Mcllroy by 4&3 in fours, but lost on the starting, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovered from a lack of four points in an individual game, although as title holders, Fourik's team had a tie to keep the trophy.
After it was the second two days, however, the weekly counterattack seems to remain over them.
North Korea says there is “no chance” of disarming unilaterally without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extended sanctions deepened mistrust of the United States and that there was no chance the country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as stopping nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing itself against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions there is no way to unilaterally disarm first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament that would gradually reward North Korea for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral, nuclear disarmament without discussion, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit of the incumbent U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for “nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to back down on tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first and foremost' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even opposes the 'declaration to end the war,'" Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a futile dream of people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: “If the other side in this nuclear disarmament issue was South Korea instead of the United States, nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula would not have ended at such a dead end.”
Still, Ri’s tone of speech was significantly different from last year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened “total destruction” of North Korea, has praised Kim for his courage to take steps for disarmament, but said much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying “whether it takes two years, three years or five months doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council sanctions must continue fully and without exception until complete, definitive nuclear disarmament is confirmed.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea just hours later due to "gangster demands".
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to disarm a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as moves toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Courses to Get Enough Vacation
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to combat the growing macho culture of learning by staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing when it comes to basic self-care.
Charles Chaizler, a professor of dream medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, is designing what he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech on the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic performance, and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a serious sleep deficiency during the week.
The course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dorm where students press on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how insufficient sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of bedtime routines.
In another section, participants learn about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to rethink their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette.”
A culture of pride in “working all night” still exists, he said, and moreover, modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the “secret weapon” of the student in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Saw, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaizler design the course after attending one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to take action for a course throughout the student city.
He hopes the next step is to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chaizler recommended that students think about setting an alarm about when to go to bed, as well as about when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which shifts the circadian rhythm, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal knocked down Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another defeating, sad day when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's split team to a 1–0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to register their first win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnston, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerard's second 18-game defeat as a manager leaving his team with eight points behind the runaway leading team Harts in the Scottish First League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and Rangers' line-up lost inspiration and chances of equalization.
Now the Rangers fell to sixth place, and Livingston climbed to third and are only behind Hibernian by goal difference.
There may be additional problems awaiting the Rangers after line judge Callum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after being apparently hit by an object from a distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Aer in the semi-finals of the Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 at Livingston who scored a point with the Harts last week and would have been delighted at the way his well-trained line-up choked opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score a point, two minutes after the start when Menga's first loss pushed Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
Then Kehan Jacobs's shot from a distance reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgow could only play openly in defense.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should receive a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Stephen Lawles collided, but referee Stephen Thompson did not give a sign of approval to the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not suffer from a head-on blow by Lassana Coulibaly and a weak blow by Ovi Edaria.
Although the start of Livingston's 34th minute may have been the opposite of the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it based on their play.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' blow.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Coolabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the wingman passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with a blockade.
But Livingston managed to get the guest players to play a type of game they enjoyed, with Litgow and Hackett catching many of the long passes.
Holt's team could have extended the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor set up well and prevented Jacobs from Litgow playing head-on corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another penalty claim after he collided with Jacobs, but Thompson again disapproved.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now one page of our almanac "On Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and we are counting ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a mainstay of science and popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Bell of Colorado, starring the seemingly inconclusive, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it now?"
Rogers: “It’s a geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitting radioactivity into the minerals."
Evans: "Say, it's probably jumping now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” alienated cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” alienated cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize alienated cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their alteration in the laboratory
You can “see” the protein common in many types of cancer and then be returned to the body
The trial vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells, ovarian cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a common protein in many cancers called HER2, and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and “learning” how to target cancer cells works in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump outburst, wearing a hat with his motto, after a Saturday night live performance.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live show on Saturday night after a useless performance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called Ghost City, with a cap that read “Make America Glorious Again,” he began to criticize Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white guy, they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The Saturday evening live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's outburst was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the post.
West also complained to the audience that he had had a hard time going behind the scenes because of his cap.
Behind the scenes I was laughed at.
They told me, "Don't show up with that hat."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in a sunken place, he said, according to Washington Exeminer.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sinking place?" he said that he would "put on his Superman drop, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
“Try it with love.”
His comments attracted resentment from the audience at least twice, and the crew of the evening show seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, one man told the publisher: "The whole studio is dumb."
The news came as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
Vest surprised many with a performance of the song "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
TPSAD leader Candace Turner tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR OPPOSEING TO THE Crowd."
But the hostess of the show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West "was his own and that's absolutely wonderful."
But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their “art”) who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“So are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formally known as Cain West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff and P Didi.
Rapper Snoop Dogg has the name Snoop Lyon and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakmor, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before a high court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington has attacked toxic masculinity.
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman as Jon Snow in the violent, medieval, fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, when he said that such roles on the screen meant that young boys often felt they had to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times culture section, Keith said he believes “something is wrong” and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #NowISay.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted he had "strong feelings" about the issue.
"Personally, I have strong feelings, at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach men as they grow up about the problems we see now?”
Keith believes television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What’s learned from TV and what’s on the street, what makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
“Something is wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that "it ended with battles and horses".
From November, Keith will perform in Sam Shepard's True West Reconstruction, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife, Rose, is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so in a way she gave me a future family and my life in the future,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character who had a love attraction with Keith's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won the Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases have been transmitted through sex, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is high.
Due to the conservative values of the country, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data provided by a staff member linked to a Republican senator as “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia’s lawmakers’ pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were on “ultra-right” sympathizers and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly includes the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information emerged online on Thursday, released by an unknown person in the Capitol Hill as the Senate hearing panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Cavanaugh, the nominee for Supreme Court Justice, took place.
The information emerged shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redstate have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the post is linked to the Waters office and information about a Waters staff member has been released, Hill said.
“These unfortunate allegations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of those false and false accusations – is in no way responsible for the information provided.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"These denials are nervous," Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be challenged.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He needs to stay calm and calm.”
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters' reaction to criticism of Democrats linked to Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
“If it’s true, it’s a big deal,” he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Waters said her office had notified "competent institutions and the police of the false claims.
"We will allow the perpetrators to be identified and will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff."
Opinion on Johnny English Attacks Again – undermines Rowan Atkinson’s spy scams
It is now traditional to look for elements of Brexit in every new British-related film, and that seems to apply to this renewed franchise of the deceitful, action-packed Johnny English – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: Born Again.
Will the careful self-riddenness of the topic of how obvious we are to be a mess be the new export opportunity that the nation has?
Despite all this, the face with big eyes and many faces of the incompetent Johnny English got a license to "roast" things a second time - his name primarily indicates that he is a comic creation with a wide range, made for viewers in cinemas in places where English is not spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for attentive glamour, resembles Clouseau a bit, has Mr. Bean's features and part of the boy playing a note of the song "Carriages on Fire" from the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Its basis is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in the now-forgotten TV commercial of Barclays, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but the humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" film brands like 007 and Impossible Mission themselves contain elements of comedy.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English’s crazy mishaps are not as inventive and focused as the dumb jokes of Bean’s character Atkinson.
The problem is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrates Britain's super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the agent on duty - a disappointingly small role for Kevin Eldon.
At the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combative figure and already suffers from a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best in this character of quasi-Theresa-May, but there is nothing special in the scenario to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling in Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher in a private school, but "on the black" gives classes for undercover agents: there are a few good guys here, when English offers a school for espionage that resembles a rock academy.
English is hurriedly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former associate Bow, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, in a relationship with a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicky Pepperdine is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for screwing up everything in the Royal Secret Service, return to action and meet the fatally beautiful Ophelia Buletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, portrayed by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd actions: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; they make a desolation after smuggling themselves on a luxury yacht on Volta; and English starts a real anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet on Wall's inside to get to know her.
All the brakes are removed for the final sequence, but as kind and noisy as it is, there is plenty of children's TV throughout the movie.
Nice, moderate things.
And as with other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that will harness his talent?
Labour denies plans for British workers to work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week - but pay for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but they would take the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea "corresponds" to the party's economic agenda and plans to make the country more workers-friendly.
The transition to a four-day working week is backed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high-ranking party member told the Sunday Times: "The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that is in line with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to adopt such an idea, the Green Party pushed for a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the aspiration has not been accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not the party's strategy and the party is not considering such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to grab the power of "faceless directors" and "profiteers" in utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their share back because the Labour government could make "deductions" for unethical behavior.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of the company's boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds, with 10 percent of the capital of private companies going to employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy are making a statement to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the Bureau’s findings could prompt some Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview published Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Peley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusations came out, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, looks like it's carved in stone.
"My decision has been made on Brett Cavanaugh and a shocking indictment is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“Everyone she named couldn’t confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring famous stars and having an impressive mission; ending poverty.
Now held for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival will be visited by tens of thousands of people who will come to the large lawn of the Central Park, not only to enjoy performances on names such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must complete several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call or some other useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is a Global Citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to seek action or just another case of “click-activism” – people who feel they make a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claimed to have registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters, who acted for many different purposes.
They say these actions have helped spur world leaders to herald commitments and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and hints resulting from their activities, of which $10 billion had already been sent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers, based in the UK, dedicated to "helping children realize their potential," which has pledged to provide $35 million for Rwanda to help address the country's malnutrition after receiving 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a note in history,” said Ambassador Tracy Ullman of Food Power, in front of the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said more than 5,000 actions were taken related to calls to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, “Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It’s going to be a long and difficult road – we’ll never make it.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. May Use Navy to Block Russian Energy Exports: Interior Ministry
Washington could use the navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinki said.
According to Zinki, Russia’s involvement in Syria – namely, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government – is a front for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because of energy trading, just like they are doing in Eastern Europe, southern Europe,” he said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, blockade to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki addressed attendees at an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit group that presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, to raise the stakes and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "uncomfortable pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statement came after the Trump administration launched a mission to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to backtrack on the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, should double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance met with resistance from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the first person in the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will carefully consider" whether to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “carefully consider” running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, and that means a woman at the helm,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether to run for president.”
Warren praised President Donald Trump’s work during a meeting in the city hall and said he was “guiding the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m too concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominated for Supreme Court Justice, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her constituency think she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent support such a proposal.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's nomination, with 38 percent in favour of a potential nomination and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names from the Democratic Party that are being discussed for nomination in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Trek Palin's post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump rally
Trek Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"As my son goes through what he's been going through since he came back, I know how other families are feeling that have been torn apart by the post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds that our soldiers are returning with," she told a crowd at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest an “elephant in the room” and said her son and other military veterans “are coming back a little different, they’re coming back hardened, they’re coming back and wondering if there’s any respect for what they and their fellow airmen, and every other member of the military, have given for the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Vassila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vassila Police.
Eighteen states and the city of Washington support challenging new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the city of Washington support challenging a new U.S. policy that prevents asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the city of Washington filed a petition to the court (amicus curiae) in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Parliament case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" had abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
The attorney general, who represents Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many of the U.S. asylum applications originated, as nations with persistent gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturns a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington City Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of law-making at the state, federal and international levels."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the application and such a provision violates that principle,” according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, defenders in the letter argue that policies that prevent immigrants from entering are harmful to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs “to offer the necessary labor force.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never conceived as the solution to all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are underway in Palu as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is unbelievably serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her baby boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
“There is no clean water.”
Residents return to their ruined homes and choose from their watered-down objects to save something they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who has fractured his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent subsequent minor earthquakes.
Tears came to his eyes as he described the powerful earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I was pressed into the rubble on the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily listing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke about China Daily’s paid allowance in the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. congressional election on November 6, China dismissed the accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election marks a combined U.S. intelligence for Reuters, a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise for trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which they level import tariffs on each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war targeted exporters from states such as Iowa, which backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter to China, said Beijing was hurting U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the weekly Des Moines Register, "now doubles the harassment with propaganda ads in our free press."
“In the dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government is abusing the cherished American tradition of free speech and free media by placing advertisements in the De Moine Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Conversely, in a nearby newspaper stand here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not see a real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China rejected his offer to publish" the column, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are drifting away from women's voices ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
With many Republicans silently watching or defending Brett Cavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn there will be negative repercussions, especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotion surrounding the case is extremely strong and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
There is no turning back from such things," Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Maxwell College at the University of Syracuse, wrote to Hill in a column published Saturday.
Richer said he suspected that the FBI's pressure to investigate Senator Jeff Flake (a Republican from Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, in front of the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" at a protest in the Senate hallway when Republicans, who have control of the legal affairs committee, decided to continue with the nomination of Cavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blacy Ford, Mick said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high," said Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
“People are already saying they’re tall; that’s right.
But they can be taller, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even ahead of Ford’s public testimony detailing her accusations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court justice nominee, analysts suggest there could be negative consequences if Republicans continue voting.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote on the committee or the last vote, or whether Cavanaugh will go to the hearing, it’s also about the way the Republicans handled this and how they treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps select Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans are divided over who to trust after Ford and Cavanaugh testified, although most accept the first-mentioned side.
A new survey by U-Gov found that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent thought Ford lied.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Cavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court nominee of showing her genitals at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup business that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The legend's latest project in technology, Inrapt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he told the start-up business.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "internet data warehouse" or POD for short.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all being available on one viewer at a time.
What is unique about the personal storage of data on the Internet is that it depends only on the user who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrapt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several developers with a project contract, and a community of coders-volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrapt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not discussing with “Facebook and Google whether to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a press release released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrapt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the Consortium of the World Wide Web Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
Recently, Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesperson in the Internet neutrality debate.
Even with the launch of Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the new era of the internet,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: a famous holder of the Victorian cross of the First World War
The only Anglican priest to receive the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for more than 100 years.
Colonel Bernard Van received the confession on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Belenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British military decoration.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wang, said it was "incredible symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the decoration.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "Through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to where the shots were fired from and with "great courage" led forward, before attacking a cannon nest himself and disabling three of the attendants.
Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's works were "something I know I'll never be able to accomplish, but it's something that makes us humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Youth Imperial Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of combined martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine being up all night to watch Bellator 206 without being able to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 fights, including six with the main card, which were broadcast live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gerard Moussassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in Britain were stunned when the channel switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after staying awake until the early hours of the fight.
One Twitter fan described the switching of a children's cartoon as "some painful joke".
"The law is that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of Bellator Marketing and Communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pepa Pig, yes"
Bellator CEO Scott Cooker said he would work on a schedule that would include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think when I think about releasing it again, I think we can probably find a solution," Cooker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to find a solution on Sunday in our time and Monday in their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we received many messages during the transfer, and none of them were favored.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't. It was a legal matter.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We’ll limit the number to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – we tried to deliver more for the fans’ sake and went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation.
Recordings on a Desert Island: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ to Sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “everyone’s not like me.”
Speaking on Radio 4's first show, Discos on a Desert Island, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a supporting character in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said, “To this day, those feelings of inferiority and diversity were the things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist became a well-known supporter of LGBT campaigns and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without division and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age gap was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at an early age,” he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said "all his views" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept him to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 — because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you’re not going to be here to be in the front row,’” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Pride by Heather Small - which was spinning in his head in preparation for the Olympics and from which he was still anxious.
CDs on a deserted island on BBC Radio 4 are on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michelson, who is out of shape, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays in the 47th game of the Ryder Cup, but will have to change shape to avoid an unfortunate turning point.
Michelson, who plays the biennial event for the 12th time, was sent to the bench by captain Jim Fourik during Saturday's doubles and quadruples.
Instead of being the center of attention, as the five-time winner often represents the United States, he split the time to cheer and practice his game, the range, in the hope of fixing what was pressing.
Never been the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the tight Le Golf Nacional, where distant rough strokes are a regular punishment for negligence.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mikkelson, in his ninth game this week, faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who plays alongside rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Mickelson’s game can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, touched my back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the celebrities and has given a lot to these teams last week and this week.
I don’t think he played two games.
I had more in mind, but that's how it went, and we thought that's what we had to do.
He loves to play like everyone else.”
Mikkelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup where he has never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furik said his presence brings something intangible to the team.
He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s resourceful, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy at team meetings.”
“I think the younger players had fun playing with him, as they did this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Björn knows that the great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Björn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before individual matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable position.
The Dane made his debut in a game at Valderrama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a lead of five points ahead of the Americans, but "crossed the finish line with their noses only", with the smallest lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"I remind myself that we had a great lead in Valderama; we had a great lead in Brookline, when we lost in Valderama, when we almost won," said Björn, vividly after watching the 2018 class win by 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a lead of 10-6 at Le Golf Nacional.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Get ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play well.
This isn’t over until the game is over.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the trophy and the focus remains on that.
All the time I say, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opponent's side - the best players in the world."
Björn added, pleased with the results of his players on a difficult golf course: "I don't want to give premature marks on this issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Tomorrow is a game, and that’s a different thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you play individually, then you test all your abilities as a golfer.
That’s the message to be sent to the players, to do their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to do his best.”
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furik will require players to play better individually than they did in doubles, with the exceptions of Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fourik himself was at both ends of the change on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brookline before ending up as a loser when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every word there," he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start like the last start we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medina.
When the momentum moves in a certain direction, it carries a lot of pressure in the middle matches.
We set the line accordingly and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is given the task of confronting Rory McLeroy first and facing the most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pulter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to play this way with the guys because I think that's how we'll cover everything," Björn said of the selection in the individual games.
The new German warship has been delayed.
The German Navy’s latest frigate was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War, but it won’t happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new class of frigates Baden-Wittenberg, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but troubled issues after the delivery hindered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wittenberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trace.
Among other important features is less frequent maintenance - it should be possible, the newest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from domestic ports.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships – which should allow Germany to have power across the oceans – will be obsolete by the time they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blom & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a number of key "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Wittemberg class would have a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the crew of the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It also turns out that the ship is drastically above its planned weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – an increase from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the newest frigates are particularly important because of the warnings of Germany's diminishing naval strength.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, confirmed that the navy was “out of deployable ships.”
The representative said the problem worsened over time because old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wittenberg class could join the navy.
National Trust eavesdrop on bats' secret lives
A new study is being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide conservation efforts in the future.
The study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow ordinary and soprano bats, as well as brown long-eared bats and doubenton bats at Inverrow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special cameramen will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using handheld detectors.
Expert analyses of the sounds from all recordings will determine the frequency depending on the species of bats.
Then a map of the habitats will be drawn to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the landscape.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of life are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the beds and the loss of habitat.
Windmills and lights also pose a risk, as do fly adhesive tapes and some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, due to their habits of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
NTS, which takes care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land in the state, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of beds, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Treve Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species that live in Scotland.
Property manager David Thomson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Trive we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there are a lot of unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us learn more about what they need to thrive.”
He stressed that it is important to check for bats before renovations are carried out because the unconscious destruction of litters can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their litters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Protection Trust, is encouraging the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and our other species, we just don't know how they live."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and lawyers to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and added that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman named Katherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to keep her from talking about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was presented today is fake news," the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or said in front of his camera.
“They like to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that’s part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they called "unacceptable transfer of suspicions from private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek damages for "moral damage in addition to an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is arguably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good boy" but gave in to that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had had sex, but that there was consent.
Majorga also claims she went to the police and pictures were taken of her injuries in the hospital, but she later agreed to a no-judgment settlement because she feared retaliation" and was worried "that she would be publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to change the deal because she is traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer moved to Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100m.
Brexit: Britain 'will always regret' losing carmakers
Britain will “always regret” if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He said it was “worrying” that Toyota-Britain told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker says the impact of a no-deal Brexit will cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a production shutdown at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in Britain have voiced concerns about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without a deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers call the risks of the logistics chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border cut that industry says could cause delays and deficiencies in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a daily stock of inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "exactly designed to avoid such border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will allow us not only to be successful in the present, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Radio 4 program today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but from other manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the long run that the additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Tzuvalaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a representative of the union at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never come back.
According to one government spokesman: "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed “for another week” as the fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination for Supreme Court justice continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election meddling, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential violations of the president’s laws.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general would jeopardize Miller’s independence has fueled gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a recorder to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he “wouldn’t like” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI into the lawsuits against Cavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date for the meeting has not yet been set, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week, given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things go, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings was not due to a reluctance to "great influence" from television journalists, although he added: "I'll agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
“The president is organizing more questions and answers sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing evidence: “We’ve looked at those numbers.”
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the president of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do that more often, and you can see that we’ve been doing it all the time over the last few weeks, and talks with the President of the United States will replace press briefings.”
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of assembled journalists.
The Secretary of Health sent a letter to EU workers in Scotland’s national health system on Brexit fears.
The Secretary of Health wrote a letter to EU workers working in Scotland’s national health system expressing the country’s gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of resolving applications for EU citizens working in lower-level public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: “The withdrawal negotiations between the UK and the EU continued throughout the summer, with a view to making the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of no deal.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the workforce, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are of value to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, the defender of the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury in a match Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reid, the head coach of the Tennessee State, told reporters the injury happened just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline of the playground and just crumpled to the ground," Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, then put him in a stretcher and took him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/degree of injury" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombie is a second-year student and plays his first season in a red jersey at Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made a total of five knockouts on Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 knockouts this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK
Under Tory’s new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters.
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The ministry expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year, funds that will be used to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and focus on high-income people.
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, with additional funds stepping up the government’s efforts to improve the situation of homeless people.
The additional amount, which in addition to the current administrative fee includes higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it, can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year.
An estimated 13 percent of London’s newly built properties were purchased by non-UK residents, leading to price hikes and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get involved in the process.
Many wealthy areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded that the administrative fee be reduced to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of offering high property prices to keep the land but not use it, and asked Mrs May to change the quotas for affordable homes in order to remedy the “shameful housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and ending evictions for no good reason.
He also wants to give councils more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime ministership to bringing back the British dream of making life better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for non-residents of the UK, as well as foreign companies, to be able to buy homes as easily as hardworking British residents.
The dream of owning your own home has become too distant for many people, and the humiliation of the homeless has become too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland'
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "ultimate ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland's national club in the future.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of reviving a club in the northeast that is currently ranked third in the Premier League with only three points less than the club at the top.
This summer, he moved to the Stadium of Light after bringing St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that’s it,” Ross told the BBC’s Scottish Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland all the time in Hampden with my dad and there was always something pulling me back.
However, I can only get such an opportunity if I am successful in managing the club.”
Some of Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he didn't feel any anxiety knowing he had to follow such established names at such a large club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My success at the moment is assessed as ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get this club there, but I will probably think that I have achieved success here only if I bring the club back there.”
Ross has been working as a manager for only three years, a career he entered after working as an assistant to the boss at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third league and brought St. Mirren back from the brink of losing the championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a crossroads for me,” he recalls taking over Alloa.
“I honestly believed that a career as a manager is the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, I made enough money from it, and I enjoyed certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in the role of manager.
“I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and I’m doing it now, and I feel more comfortable in this role than I’ve ever felt in my entire adult life.”

According to one study, the perfect time for a beer is at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in profits for British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA Business Consulting said: "The sunny weather and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profits of pubs increased by 2.8 percent and restaurants decreased significantly.
The drop in restaurant sales of 1.8 percent in June worsened further in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly sell beverages have seen a much greater increase compared to previous years than restaurants where there has been a decline.
Pubs that mostly sell food were also badly affected by the sunny periods, though not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales by only three percent.
Paul Newman, a holiday and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent over a period of one year will be especially devastating in addition to the current pressures created by costs.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for owners of places where food is predominantly sold, and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide much-needed respite.”
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, rose 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a stalled launch of new brands.

One in five children has a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents.
One study found that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” profile that they show to their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates a social media profile that hides it from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta accounts, an abbreviation for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted on such profiles.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a cleaned-up “main” profile that they showed to their parents, along with other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter stumbled upon a teenage boy asking others to rape him.
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them was their secret.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Elid Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” on the board of Scottish Athletics
Elid Doyle was elected non-executive director of the board of Scottish Athletics at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete and President Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the sport’s leadership to take advantage of her extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletics community has tremendous respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit enormously if she became a board member," Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I'm ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."

He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell whether I will recover or to what extent.
The whole process was laborious, but I managed to fully recover, again I can walk and do agility exercises!
Thank you for your message of encouragement!”
A Breast Pump Ad in Which Mothers Are Compared to Cows Has Separated Opinions on the Internet
A breast pump company has caused divisions of opinion online when it published an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To commemorate the launch of what is said to be the world’s “most powerful breast pump,” user-centric tech company Elvie has released a hilarious video-inspired advertisement to showcase the freedom the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn of cows full of hay on a song whose lyrics are: "Yes, I milk, but you don't see the tail" and "If you haven't noticed this is not fumes, this is my breast."
The chorus continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, I'm milking my breasts."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlighted the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, just like us, need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except for the fact that their children are stolen from them just a few days after they are born.
The Elvie breast pump discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra (“Elvie”/“Mother”)
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "Really inappropriate advertising."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "funny."
“I think this idea is brilliant.
I would have bought a pump like this if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
“It’s a great product,” one commenter said.
Another commented: “This is a fun advertisement for mothers who milk (often at their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced while discreet pumps were peed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires, no pipes, and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out of the house while milking the milk.
Anna Ballarin, partner and RDR at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between milk-milking women and dairy cows, we wanted to put milk-milking using a pump and the challenges that it brings in the center of attention, while showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings in a fun and closer way.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has been featured in all titles.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Martha Jakubowski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp on Texas border
The number of migrant children in custody has increased significantly, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared endangering their own stay in the country if they asked to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would be required to file fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegally residing in the country, and many of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That's why we continue to pursue those individuals," Albens said.
In order to speed up the processing of child cases, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than within 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard was.
Many of them will appear via a video conference call, not in person, in order to bring their legal status case before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for relief will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months said.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where because of its size, there is a greater likelihood that signs that the child is facing difficulties will be ignored.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could add to the trauma that most of them are already facing.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying in Syria under the pretext that they were participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they will be treated appropriately."
"They must withdraw immediately and without imposing conditions," he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to wage this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" of the two terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them trained and advised by both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Muallem said the conditions were good for them to return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing a question that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction assistance until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene early meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "considering the articles of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further meddling in it.
Why Trump won a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely, which is likely the hope of many liberals.
In what will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final in the presidency ever seen!”
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, peak time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Nielsen said Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak times, up 1.7 million from four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC peaked at about 3.5 million on the evenings of the news.
“It’s like a fire that people feel attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neil Baer, the chief television producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” for a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed by an attack.
Nell Scovel, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He said, 'Because I think he's really funny,'" Mrs. Scovel told me.
There is also a certain fun value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the well-being of the global economy.
This is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet you are no longer an uninformed citizen when for six hours you see a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of the source of "deep background" for his book "Fear", a bomber jacket made of Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather ("clothes with thick arrogance."
I will never be able to see Super Mario in the same way.
“Part of what he does and what gives you the feeling of watching a reality show is that he brings you something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars for Trump’s rotating show crew and daily turnarounds.
You can’t afford to miss an episode because then you won’t be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Flace this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watching MSNBC while he was filming on CNN.
He couldn’t stop watching, at least not when Brett Cavanaugh was due to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in a critical state.
"I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past and people saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'"

Influx of foreign funds in the narrowest midterm elections in the race for the Upper House
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district is receiving a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, from which there are two candidates in the race for the same seat.
Pittsburgh’s recently reconstructed suburban area is run by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another area in a snap election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th congressional district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional district.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that old areas were being manipulated in favor of Republicans, a violation of the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional district is a tough campaign funding competition between the main party sponsors, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a notorious name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in Pennsylvania's early election for the 18th congressional district held in March that featured widespread media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the area by a margin of 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a small advantage.
U.S. Punishes El Salvador for Supporting China
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under some pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw U.S. diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only in relation to El Salvador, penalties were taken into account, which received US aid of about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and the country’s high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar rally last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading towards the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials said they wanted the conference to progress and effectively put an end to any consideration of punishing El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to address a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the rally, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations about the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that could happen is the release of Special Adviser Robert Miller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, for which there is currently very solid evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation into the fact that Mr. Trump’s campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear again before voters, and possibly before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There is a lot of uncertainty here, and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, or that of his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are now facing several such points of change.
What do we do if Mr. Trump resigns from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is in the hot seat after the newspaper reported that last year he proposed to covertly film the president and speculated that he was inappropriate for the office he holds.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is inaccurate.
“What are we going to do if Brett Cavanaugh’s new investigation requested by the FBI is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault allegations and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that blames Mr. Trump?
If we fail all these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead.
But I don’t think that’s going to happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on a table with the swastika logo.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

'Rangers' Graham Dorans optimists ahead of 'Rapid Vienna' clash
The Rangers are hosting a clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware of the fact that after a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, a victory over the Austrians will solidify their position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
Graham Dorens, the midfielder due to a knee injury, was prevented from appearing in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone to greater achievements.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game believing we could do something and came back with a point.
Maybe we could have given a little more in the end, but the draw was likely and fair.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and we were better.
On Thursday, we have another big European night ahead of us.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a good result in the last game, but I am sure that with the support of the fans we will retaliate and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a difficult year considering everything that has happened, my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is some positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that now we can move forward, put last season behind us and achieve success.”
Women can’t sleep at night because of this fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to discuss the same thing,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationalwide.
Here’s where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t share your wishes with them early.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how you can get care because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a traditional long-term care policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy, which can help you cover your expenses or provide yourself with self-insurance with your own funds, if you have them.
Organize your legal documents: Avoid legal battles right from the start.
Get a health care authorization so you can empower a person of trust to oversee your medical care and ensure health professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the power of attorney for your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medications he takes and his allergies?
Please note these details in writing so that you are ready.
"It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are," Martin asks.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan like this.”
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST (British Summer Time) as a "random act."
The victim did not see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are appealing to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communications, aid workers are unable to obtain information from Dongala County, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Below are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a county stretching more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coast in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The district, which is an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite Sulawesi coast.
Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongal.
A tsunami also struck western Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck an area near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached 10 metres (10 ft) and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focused earthquake struck Pidi Jaya County in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the quake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, meddling in a report on domestic violence and opposing arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police officers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in the Matt-Su detention facility with the possibility of getting out if he pays $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he was pleading in court, the network said.
Palin faces three A-class offenses, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with B-class misconduct, sentenced to one day in prison and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The Alaska Veterans Court case is pending.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, meddling in a crime report for domestic violence, and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she said her son’s violent behavior stemmed from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck an area near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors call for rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck at the Home Depot in October to raid a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists in his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a statement of intent to seek the death penalty delivered to the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, it is possible to pronounce the death penalty on both of these grounds from the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The execution of the attack required "detailed planning and deliberation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "terrible, cruel and perverted."
"Sajfulo Habibulajevic Saipov caused, injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Laure Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccio," the statement reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since a death penalty case was prosecuted in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was executed in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty on all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and imposing a life sentence without the possibility of release will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at a Tory party conference.
Former Ukip leader said politicians must "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's lawmakers proposing that he be in charge of EU negotiations.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn said at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have so far "been outside the EU" if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in terms of reuniting her deeply divided members was highlighted by the anti-Brexit members of the Tory party who joined a separate anti-Brexit protest held in the city.
The prime minister has been trying to continue implementing the Checkers plan despite attacks from pro-Brexit, counter-Brexit and the EU.
Allies insisted it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and would force Eurosceptics and Labour members to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bonn told the pro-Brexit rally Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "reject the Checkers plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been involved and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge of the negotiations, we would have been outside the EU by now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to reject the Checkers plan.”
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: “We did not fight world wars for now to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bonn dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely inaccurate."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tory and pro-Brexit party, was also present at the march and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Checkers plan is not well received by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well received by our party and our activists who are actually the ones taking to the streets who owe our election victory.
Please drop the Checkers plan and start listening to us."
In a targeted message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to pass on the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let you get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us a victory in Brexit and that will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, counter-Brexit figures marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in downtown Birmingham.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists appeared this weekend carrying banners with the words "Tories against Brexit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, mocked the Conservatives about the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference regarding the application created by the party.
"These are the people who tell us that they can put in place IT systems and all the necessary technology for Canada plus plus, for a border without controls, for a free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to think twice about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "think well of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spokeswoman spoke about her future at a town hall in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Jeff Dill, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with voters since Trump took office, using a city hall format.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman on top.”
The suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Sims from the team "LSU"
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Simms of the LSU team that occurred on Friday was arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Diteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms had a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of it," Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, said in a statement.
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the crime scene, possessing a gun, and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
As a 192-centimeter junior who grew up at Baton Rouge, Simms played in 32 games with 10 appearances last season, an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 goals per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closer to world title after team orders secured victory over Sebastian Vetel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team’s orders would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the lid while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered boxing first and left Hamilton to fight the turmoil at the end of the group, something that was supposed to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the box one lap later and came behind Vetel, but Hamilton went ahead after the one-on-one action that forced the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave the interior at his own free risk to remain on the sidelines after the double move to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the net and finished seventh on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race and steered the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimi Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the boxing lap 44, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen came in fourth.
“Today is a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team made a really exceptional decision to have their own pair in the race," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she had not published a letter from Christine Blassie Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad and rude and dishonest."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's been going on in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and mean and reckless and insincere," he said.
“When you see posts and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you release this information?
Do you remember her answer... did you publish the document -- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute then.
Did we publish it... No, we didn’t publish it,” he added, imitating the senator.
A letter of information was sent to Feinstein regarding the accusations against Cavanaugh by Ford back in July, which were published in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t publish her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked.”
But the president did not seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same at the rally on Saturday: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexually abusing three women, the president suggested that Democrats use allegations to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to regain power in any way they can.
You can see their malice, their meanness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to trample on in order to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the match against Dundee
The Dundee Stars compensated for Friday's loss of the Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took advantage of two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Frances Beauvilliers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney scored an advantage for the host before Dwyer took the lead back to Giants.
François Bouchard tied for the Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's boys, who retaliated with a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides in the season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the addition of Kendall McFaul, which was provided by David Rutherford while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan secured the host's lead by 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Cooney to score 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first pause, when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard brought them back again with a powerful game and a goal, with a score of 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen secure Dundee's lead in the game for the first time late in the second period and he secured his team's victory in the half of the final period of the fifth game.
The Giants, which have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
An air traffic controller was killed while helping hundreds of people on a plane escape the quake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero since he died helping a plane with hundreds of people take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks continue to devastate the area, with many trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which was continuously swaying.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air flight number 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower the moment he thought the tower was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision likely saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be taken to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This news broke our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sighee and Butong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to be increasing as many bodies are still underneath the rubble, while many cannot even be accessed," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves reaching up to six metres devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances carry bodies every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere."
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” asked CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia Air Niugini Says One Man Disappeared After Plane Crash in Lagoon
The airline that operated the plane, which crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says one person is missing after it said the 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had not been able to locate the male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane struck a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane flew very low.
"That's a very good thing," Janes said.
Janes said he and the others managed to cross the water that reached up to half of them and headed to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working near the port's reconstruction also helped rescue people by using an inflatable boat to carry people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 ft) of water.
Data from the aviation safety network showed that 111 people had died in accidents on airlines registered in the PNG in the past two decades, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst Determines Timeframe of the Night a Woman Was Burned Alive
The prosecution ended by presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury that he used phone records to connect the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellys was with Chambers the night of her death, contrary to his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellys was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from her phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is due to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide the case later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to refute the negative attitude towards this genre by incorporating positive messages into their music.
Bristol's "High Breed" argues that hip-hop has moved away from its origins as a music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to go back to his roots and re-popularize conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced their revival through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York Nanny Sues Couple After Being Fired After Sending ‘Racistic’ Message
A New York-based nanny is suing a married couple for being fired on discrimination grounds after mistakenly receiving a message from her mother complaining that she was "another black woman."
The couple denies being racist, saying the lawsuit is actually "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first day of work of the new nurse, Giselle Morris, she learned that she was black.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaxman had actually done, she “feel uncomfortable” firing Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is African-American, was doing her job poorly and that she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines instead.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day at work and then sent home to Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple and seeking compensation for $350 a day in redundancy for six months, an engagement that would include her living with the family, what she was originally engaged to do, but without a contract.
"I want to show them that these things should not be done," she told The Post on Friday, adding, "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple responded to the lawsuits that they were racist, saying that firing Ms. Morris was reasonable because they feared they could no longer trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told The Post.
But would you trust your children to a person you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Claiming the lawsuit constituted “extortion,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to attack someone who is in such a situation?
“It’s not good,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still pending, the public immediately condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won’t be able to connect with a talking bear, reveals new letter
Karen Yankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
It’s very interesting that we now know all this about Paddington’s huge success.
After saying her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he got the inspiration to write the book from a little bear-shaped toy, would still be optimistic if his work wasn't well received, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "both bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt a quiet pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and didn't want to brag at all," she said.
But because he felt Paddington so real, it was almost like having a child who achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though success is not due to you.
I think Paddington’s success was perceived that way.
Although it was a creation and a figment of his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington itself.
My daughter was on her deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital "Louis Pasteur 2" in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad and that he was not expected to survive," Ms. Ednan-Laperousse said.
“Then Nad called me to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
And I said, "Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications she was given to keep her heart pumping was slowly decreasing and they were leaving her system.
She died early, and that meant all her systems were failing.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay calm.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperousse, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
I bowed my head and the tears didn’t stop.
It’s hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Grieving Women Put Cards on Bridge to Prevent Suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys set up cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son had great potential to become a chef, as well as an infectious smile.
Everyone remembered him for his smile.
People have always said that his smile can illuminate any room.
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place."
His brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, “I’m constantly afraid that it will have a sequential effect.”
Ms. Davis makes the cards “to let others know that there are people out there who they can reach out to and talk to, even if they are friends.
Don’t sit quietly, you have to start talking.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was married for 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt unhappy or depressed, or he didn’t say anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of the Christmas day when the children opened their gifts, and he did not look them in the eye at all and made no contact with them.
She said his death was a huge trauma for all of them, but they had to find a way to get through it: “Such a thing is breaking up the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Cavanaugh's future has been uncertain since the FBI opened an investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something that resembles what he was looking for, a time-limited investigation with a limited scope, maybe we could achieve a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "disintegrating" amid a guerrilla stalemate.
Why didn't Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is solely due to timing.
The midterm elections are due to be held in just a few weeks, i.e. on November 6, and if, as expected, Republicans face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who in turn worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to change the draw and enter the Supreme Court.
Refugee numbers in North Korea 'decreased' under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seog, citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 border crossings last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
Most of the refugees from North Korea eventually obtain citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China regards these people as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
North-South relations, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on the stalemate of denuclearization talks.
This followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed U.S. sanctions for stagnation in progress since then.
“If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm first,” Mr. Ree said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said that given his temperament, he was inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman acted that way, they would say she was ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Cavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blassie Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening remarks, sometimes even yelling and sobbing as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him “a grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation” organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony is proof that he can't serve in the Supreme Court because he turned out to be biased against Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Cavanaugh from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, he’s not fit to serve in the court where he’s currently in office,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible verdicts that Cavanaugh would make against the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered to be the subject of conservative justice.
In confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'That's really wonderful, isn't it,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to use it.
It's really a sharp criticism, months and years of gathering anger,which she can't get rid of herself without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, right?”
She continued, "I've been helped a lot by a woman who was in an executive position somewhere, who told me that she cried when she was angry, but she managed to develop her own technique, so when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think that’s genius.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet valve for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in an office dominated by men is when I once started crying with unspeakable rage and an elderly woman, a cold manager whom I had always had a certain fear of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll enjoy the fact that they managed to reach out to you.”
Patricia Schroeder was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and withdrew from the presidential race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she shouldn’t consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me 30 years later with a laugh.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given the fact that the campaign was long overdue, she did not have enough funds, so she promised not to enter the race if she did not raise $ 2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 each would only give her $250.
“Do they think there should be a discount for me?” she asked.
During her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, that is, gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, she began to cry.
“If you saw me, you would probably think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the media reacted to the incident.
“You’d think Clinex would be my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She cried?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of fire with the start of the U.S.-China trade war has been daunting and although the battle is far from over, the clash between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly over the course of this week with the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has been returning in kind every time, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to repay the U.S. on an equal footing, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will give up the same in the near future.
To force Washington to retreat means to accept its demands, but public bow to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing does well, pressures from the trade war with the United States could result in positive support for China in the long run as it reduces the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for the start of a sharp decline from an economic point of view in any of the countries is much more dangerous than previously determined by observers," said Abigail Grace, a security research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New Research.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild a country that has been ravaged by a long war that has lasted for more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas devastated by the terrorists in order to return the situation to normal.
All conditions are now provided for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilaterally imposed economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime welcomed aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he said he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team beat the US team in the 2018 Ryder Cup with an end result of 16.5 vs 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its primacy after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mikkelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, at his first blow from a hole pointed the ball into the water in pair-3 on the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all rounds, becoming one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began to be organized in the current format in 1979.
Jordan Spit lost 5-4 to European team's lowest-ranking player, Torbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top-ranked player, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have last played at the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio García, a participant in eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the most titles in the tournament with 25.5 points during his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop.
This year has been really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I’m very happy to have the title back.
Team play is the most important thing and I am happy to be able to help," said the emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He now cedes the place to his compatriot John Ramm, who beat Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, 2-1 on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," Ram, 23, said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It is an amazing statistic of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to steer the game toward low-grass courts, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finow, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
Team captain Jim Fourik said after the team's disappointment, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
This morning we had a tough time with the team.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the Association of Professional Golfers of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it to them.
They outplayed us.
New information on the red tide: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinelas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, conditions of uneven flowering of algae have been observed in the Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide, a consequence of the flowering of red algae, stretches about 130 miles off the coast from North Pinelas County to South Lee County.
Parts of the red tide can also be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but the number is still lower compared to last week.
A red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
