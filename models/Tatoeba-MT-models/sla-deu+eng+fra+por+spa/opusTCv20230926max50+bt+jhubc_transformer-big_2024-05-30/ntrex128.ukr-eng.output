Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will be “associated with the muppets”
Some are horrified by the recommendation to change the name of their post to "Member of the Parliament of Wales" (MWP).
This recommendation came about because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Parliament of Wales".
The whole political spectrum is concerned that this may provoke ridicule.
One Labour AA said his group was concerned about rhymes from Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means “mindless” and pwp means the act of defecation.
The CA from the Wales Party said his group as a whole was "not satisfied" and offered alternatives.
One Welsh Conservative said his group was "unbiased" about the name change, but pointed out that the MWP could quickly become a "mappet".
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to change the names, noted: "The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves."
The Welsh Self-Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of the public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the Assembly as the Parliament of Wales received widespread support.
As for how to call the CA, the commission proposes to call them "members of the Parliament of Wales", i.e. WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest public support.
Of course, the CA offers alternatives, but trying to reach an agreement can cause problems to Chairman Elin Jones, who should submit a bill on changes within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules for the suspension of the Association and the structure of the system of committees.
The CA will hold a final vote on its new name when the legislation is discussed.
Macedonians go to vote on a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote was organized to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes holding a referendum on changing the name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are silent, because the churches of Harlem are going through difficult times
“The old people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither one nor the other.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
“People are socializing differently nowadays.
Bars are no longer the kind of local lounge they regularly visit.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders hope, and “sooner or later they will be where they started.”
Churches, he added, can be replaced by houses with condominiums, and there will be people who will not help the shrines left nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white,” Adams explained, “so this will speed up the day when all these churches close, because it is unlikely that the majority of those who move to condominiums will become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white communities even before Haarlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and Saint-Martin a decade later.
The indigenous white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community, which held ceremonies nearby, received ownership of the building.
Saint Martin moved to the black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street. These merchants did not want to hire blacks and promote them.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners wanted to rebuild it and installed a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in Saint-Martin, proudly called the carillon "bells of the poor".
An expert who played the carillon in July called it a “cultural treasure” and an “indispensable historical tool.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world, played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to a larger carillon in the church Riverside.
According to Mr. Merriweather, he was not replaced in Saint-Martin.
What has been happening in Saint-Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The council — the governing body of the parish, which consists of lay leaders — wrote to the diocese in July that it was concerned that the diocese would “try to transfer costs” to the council, despite the fact that the council did not take part in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California
According to officials, on Saturday, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him. The boy was diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place at almost 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and he and a group swam to get him out of the water.
At first, Hummel thought it was just the thrill of catching a lobster, but then realized that the boy was screaming: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his collarbone was completely torn.
“I shouted to everyone to come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken on a propeller to the Children's Hospital Rady in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told a news briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim received traumatic injuries to the upper part of the torso.
For investigation and security purposes, authorities blocked access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with islands with cosmetics similar to those in department stores. Work on the islands will be qualified sellers.
As part of the increased entry into the British market of cosmetics worth 2.8 billion pounds (continues to grow at a time when sales of clothing and household goods are declining), increased islands with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country. Next year, if the idea turns out to be successful, the shops will appear
Investments in cosmetics are related to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space that was previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing assortment of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will have more space: branded areas will appear, similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also updating the range of Boutique cosmetics: now most of the products presented will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly demanded by young buyers.
Fragrance Shop is also testing its trays at two Sainsbury’s stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, north London, last week, and the second one will open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of food every day in small stores forces supermarkets to make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coupet, Sainsbury’s CEO, said their stores would become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to counter Aldi and Lidl’s discounters with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has opened branches of Argos in hundreds of its stores, and a number of Habitats departments have also opened. Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago and claim that this has boosted food sales as well as made both chains more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to update the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over how to share pharmacy revenues in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds will help by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We have changed the look of our islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasant for customers.
We have also invested in specially trained consultants who will be able to give advice.
The range of brands we present is designed to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which competes with the old way of buying. "
Peter Jones is "rave" because Holly Willoughby left the deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
“Dragon’s Lair” star Peter Jones is “raging” over the fact that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has quit the deal with his brand of goods for life (the cost of the deal is <0xC2><0xA3>11 million) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for the Truly homewear and accessories brand.
The couple's business was associated with the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of the program This Morning announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby brought Peter Jones's "Dragon's Lair" star to rage when she stepped out of their lucrative livelihood business at the last minute to focus on new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “raunting” when the golden girl on TV confessed during a tense meeting Tuesday at Jones’ business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m meant she no longer had enough time to dedicate his clothes to their brand.
This business was associated with the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow and had to double Willoughby's fortune, which is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby said on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from the UK to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was no doubt Holly’s top priority.
It was to become its long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to withdraw from the business stunned all stakeholders.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost on the eve of the launch.
Headquarters in Marlowe has a full warehouse of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter This Morning, which is one of the highest paid stars in the UK, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes) and create further delays with the launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother of three and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willoughby and Kapp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman of the board in March.
The couple spent the holidays together, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of Baldwin's firm, which is engaged in television production.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his case.”
Hard conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for a comment that would be considered “non-presidential” and also for the very positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump do such great things?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
I didn’t do anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But talks on denuclearization have come to a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea sees no “appropriate response” from the United States to its first disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the United States is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Speaking at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have such a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of U.S. troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battered stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds killed
In particular, after the earthquake on Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was affected, a national disaster was not declared, and this is a prerequisite for obtaining international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is somewhat difficult,” Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign staff will be able to work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Given the fact that there are constantly earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, but they are not typical of other coasts.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was valid, probably contributed to the deaths.
Moving between the many Indonesian islands is not easy even in the best of times.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
The medical ship, which was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, sails to Palu, but will be able to reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and increased road and rail costs.
But the funding shortfall has created problems for Mr Joko’s administration, which plans to re-elect next year.
Mr Joko is also hampered by persistent interfaith feuds in parts of Indonesia where members of the Muslim majority have opted for a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, tens of thousands evicted from their homes as a result of the confrontation of Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores a goal from the depth of the field and equals the score with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat to Chelsea in the Premier League with his goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Starridge received a pass from Jerdan Shachiri when he was about 27 meters away from the Chelsea goal. At this point, his team lost 1-0.
He flipped the ball on his left leg and charged it in the direction of the far rod.
The ball flew high above the penalty area in the direction of the upper right corner of the goal.
He flew over the jumping Capa Arisabalaga and fell into the gate.
"It was just an attempt to take that position so as not to waste time. Players like Shachiri always go into the attack as much as possible, so I just tried to make sure I had as much time as possible," Starrige told LiverpoolFC.com.—
I saw Kante approaching and made one touch, I didn’t think about it too much and just took the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half in which Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The striker of the blues passed the pass back to Mateo Kovacich, turned around in the middle of the field and quickly ran to half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly played against the wall in the middle of the field.
Next, he made a good penetrating pass, which led Azar to the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defense and made a decisive left-foot hit in the grid of the far rod. The ball passed the goalkeeper of Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the stadium “Sao Paulo” in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the quake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Indonesian disaster relief agency said on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the wreckage of buildings destroyed during Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which caused waves 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was flooded with debris from destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
The investigation into the murder began after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stabbing wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called for people who saw or heard something to respond.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is now in its early stages, but I ask everyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have filmed something on a DVR, to contact us, as the information in these videos could be very important for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are currently informing the victim's closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed in or out of the house.
When he found out what had happened, he lost the gift of language.
Residents are now told that it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime appeared a woman in tears.
She says, “It’s so horrible.”
At 14:00, two police vans stood behind the fence, another van was in front of the fence.
Several police officers stood behind the fence and watched the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to write a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and call code 247 and the date September 30.
Cromwell's statue near Parliament becomes a new monument that will suffer from "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved retribution for the Taliban-style destruction of many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell’s community called Mr. Crick’s proposal “foolish” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Community, said: "Given the current debate about the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell near Westminster Palace would become a target was inevitable."
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or on his orders.
It is likely that Cromwell will undeservedly be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The majestic Cromwell statue of sculptor William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testimony to the mood of the 19th century and part of the historiography of the figure, which, according to many, is still worth honoring.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, probably more in the late 19th century than now, consider Cromwell a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is accurate is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures who represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also to be celebrated and honored.”
Killer Pig Destroys Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by the surname Yuan, was found dead in blood with a torn artery near a pig farm at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
In Xinjiang, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is going to vaccinate pigs in a pig house.
On Wednesday, he reportedly left with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his brother found him dead and saw that the door of the pigsty was open.
The brother noted that in the pigsty there was a large boar with blood on its mouth.
Forensic examinations confirmed that a 249-kilogram boar killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and distorted,” said a cousin named Wu, who was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when police were gathering evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking people.
It is reported that Yuan's family and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rarely, but cases of attacks of pigs on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and inflicted a man with critical injuries.
Ten years before that, a pig weighing 295 kg kept a Welsh farmer pressed against a tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a trigger.
“They are just playful.
They're like children, very inquisitive... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rose will bring extensive downpours to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the coming days, the Rose will bring rains with floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
The rose had winds of 137 km per hour (this is a Category 1 hurricane) as of 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that on Sunday Rose will go to the north.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific begins to form a valley that moves east to the west coast of the United States. When on Monday Rose approaches the peninsula of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push strong tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, the rose will bring up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Further, in the coming days, tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching basin, will create heavy downpours in the southwest.
In this area from 2.54 to 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous storm floods, garbage streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will result in increased precipitation in places up to 5–7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5–10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in large areas of Arizona.
Rainfall floods are possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise not to go to the desert on foot, because tropical showers are possible.
Heavy rains can make the canyons stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring raging winds and dust storms here.
The approach of the valley will cause heavy rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The amount of precipitation can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause low flows of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and Monday morning, and in the evening Monday and Tuesday the rain will become more extensive.
Heavy rain will go over the "For Corners" from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes can be observed throughout the United States, as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, you will see a wonderful example of sharp temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
This is an almost 7-degree difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to return and spread again.
It is expected that in a significant area of the center and east of the United States will be warm until October, and temperatures from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperatures.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of exceeding average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Cavanaugh hearing.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks watched the delightful testimony of Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
The political confrontation continued, with the channels interrupting scheduled programs to announce Friday’s latest news: a deal prepared by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was groping her drunk and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his emotional testimonies that he was 100 percent sure that this was not the case.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, as reported by research company Nielsen.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately possible to get figures from other networks that also showed the hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
For comparison, such an audience is similar in size to the audience watching a playoff game or an Oscar award.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion show hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the leader among all channels during the hearing, which lasted all day, with an average viewership of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the central figure of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh. After that, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras recorded how protesters shouted at Flake as he tried to take the elevator to the hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was cursed, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth?
They said to him, “You have power, and many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast channels were broadcast live hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for a full Senate vote.
Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would consider charges against the candidate next week, which the Democratic minority demands.
Flake was partially persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking with Koons and then with several other senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice had an impact, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to nominate Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “games in politics” around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview, which came alongside Theresa’s front-page interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Brexit plan, saying it was “absolutely absurd” to offer Britain and the EU to levy duties on each other.
Who shot Wade Sims: police arrested Dayton Simpson on suspicion of the death of a player at the University of Louisiana
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of a dispute between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the affiliated CBS television channel WAFB, the police seized the glasses from the crime scene and noted that they found the DNA of Simpson.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was given a bail of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police Special Investigation Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that facilitated the arrest.
Louisiana State University sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement agencies for their “carefulness and commitment to justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
Last season, his average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what worries you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ash on Mexico City
Ash, which ejects volcano Popocatepetl, reached the southern areas of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as activity began in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center monitored numerous noises and tremors.
The photo on social networks shows thin layers of ash on the windshield of cars on the outskirts of Mexico City, such as Hochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located at a distance of 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after the earthquake of magnitude 7.1 in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with a special police unit. Thousands of people joined protesters in demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on secession.
A masked pro-separatist group held back by special forces threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
Clashes took place later in the day, the police used sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, groups of independence supporters chanting “We will not forget, we will not forgive!” faced supporters of the country’s preservation shouting, “Long live Spain!”
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal by Madrid but marked by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region, which is seeking independence, remain high.
Voters mostly decided to vote for independence, but turnout was low, as the majority of those opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia could gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy of being able to vote, but now we are in a deadlock,” he said.
Despite a vital but very difficult victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have failed to maintain momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders are in voluntary exile or imprisoned pending trial for their participation in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the police support protest on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidate status in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we see from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after a car drove into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car drove into a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noted that the gate and the house itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point on the car shot with a crossbow.
Strike of Menga secured “Livingston” victory over “Rangers” with a score of 1-0
The first goal of Dolly Menga in the composition of "Livingston" became a winner
Raised in the Livingston class, he stunned the Rangers and brought Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's strike proved decisive: the team of Gary Holt in a second rose to one level from Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has not won a single away win in the Premier League this season and next Sunday will play against the leaders of the "Harts", from which it is behind by eight points.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues its unbeatable run to six games in the division, and head coach Holt has not yet suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
“Livingston” misses the chances that are provided by the unknowing guests.
Holt's team should have been ahead of them long before they scored, because their directness creates all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defensive but struck along the goal, then Alan Litgow broke past the goal after squeezing and accepting Craig Hulkett's blow along the goal, which he made with his head.
The hosts were satisfied that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, while they knew that they could cause problems to the guests from the standard provisions.
And so the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson engaged Meng, who took the ball and scored from the center of the penalty area.
Prior to this stage, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but the defense of the field owners proved impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly not disturbed.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was hit by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow struck past the goal in another standard Livingston hand.
The canopies constantly flew into Livingston's penalty box and were constantly neutralized, and two penalties applications - after Hulkett's attack on Glenn Middleton, who came out as a substitute, and for the hand game - were rejected.
The phenomenon of "Livingston": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and the result of "Livingston".
Everyone played well, they continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and line-up has remained virtually unchanged since returning to the top level, but a tribute should be paid to Holt for how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hulkett played great, organized the defense very well, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to be constantly on guard.
The Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
Previously, they played very well under Gerrard, but now significantly do not reach those standards.
They lacked the last ball — only once they broke through the defenses of the field masters — and it was something like an awakening for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received ambiguously in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and blue skies were visible.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
There have been some disputes between them over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police did not allow 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters of the president still showed up nearby to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — many Kurds among them — also made themselves heard. They condemn Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests show the ambiguity of the guest, which some German Turks called a hero, and others — a dictator.
Road accident in Depford: cyclist killed in a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the Deptford area in the southeast of the city at approximately 10:15 a.m. British Standard Time.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident came months after another cyclist died after a driver escaped from the scene on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
London police said they were working to identify the man to inform his immediate family.
Travel is prohibited and bus routes are changed, motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Injured in Riots
Six prison workers were injured as a result of riots in a men's prison under strict regime, the prison administration said.
The riots at Her Majesty Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire began around 9:30 a.m. British Standard Time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
To stop the riots, initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special unit "Tornado" was called.
Officers were provided with medical care in connection with mild facial injuries received at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “We have recruited specially trained prison staff to deal with the ongoing incident at Her Majesty Long-Lartin Prison.
Six employees received medical care in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and their time behind bars may be extended.”
In the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin more than 500 prisoners, among whom the most dangerous offenders of the country.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was sent to inpatient treatment after the attack of the prisoner.
In October last year, a special police unit was summoned to the prison to stop serious riots, during which prisoners were attacked with billiard layers.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with downpours (arid areas may benefit)
Tropical depression seldom strikes Arizona, but it could happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rose travel through the desert’s southwest, creating a risk of heavy flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday for areas from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained their tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950.
And Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, in the Mogollon-Rome area of Arizona is expected from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and in some places up to 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive between 2.54 and 5.08 cm of rainfall, with places possibly up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flooding, the Rose rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of these downpours are likely to be useful as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category of drought, according to weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rose leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rose, on Sunday morning still in hurricane force with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm meets cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Thus, it is expected that in the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday, the hurricane will cause a landslide in Mexico.
The amount of rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a significant risk of flooding.
“The total rainfall from Lower California to northwestern Sonora is expected to be between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, with places possibly up to 25.4 cm,” according to weather.com.
Next, Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, go further through Arizona and late Tuesday night reach southern Utah.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rains in Lower California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern American desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flooding and garbage flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer-Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset with knife wounds.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 a.m. British Standard Time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are asking to respond to anyone who may have any video of these events on their phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “tolerated the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, frenziedly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusations that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on the charges she made.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "the American people saw the brilliance, the character and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable public service experience,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president casually mentioned Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, some of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
“I’m not running, but I’m really running,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, an aide to one of the Republican leaders told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed, many washed into the ocean, when giant waves hit the beaches as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six meters (18 ft) high crashed into the shore at dusk, knocking many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and did not immediately start to flee, and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a briefing in Jakarta.
“It wasn’t just a tsunami, it moved cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been overturned and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
Shootings in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPTT) said the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could contribute to the strength of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage "widespread" and noted that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the wreckage of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the casualties and damage could be greater than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"The lines of communication were completely damaged and we did not receive any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had fled to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could become much bigger,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves arrived at the time indicated in the warning.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a house shouting out wild warnings about a tsunami approaching people on the street below the building.
A few minutes later, the water wall crashed into the shore, taking buildings and cars with them.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage that severed communications around Palu, making it difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
Military personnel have begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other necessities.
The city's airport is open only for assistance, and it will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala made it safely to the city of Palu, where they hide in tarpaulins installed in the yard of their office, but on the way they saw scenes of devastation, Mr Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to take decisive action to deal with the aftermath of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, financing, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we will be able to accept international assistance, but that status has not yet been granted.”
Already the second night fell on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, and friends and families of those who have not yet found, still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones will be a miracle that will adorn these gloomy plots of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers picked up a woman who had been lying under rocks for two days with her mother’s body nearby.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s paragliding national team, trained two missing paragliders to participate in the Asian Games, which took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paragliders trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Handon tells how hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel, which spread among the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray tick, not a double blue tick.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while replenishing an ATM at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee of Brink, who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to the news of the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to add more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man “ran from behind to an employee of Brink” and stole a bag of money intended for replenishment.
Witnesses spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, the news said, but police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about these individuals should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "Formerly officially known as Kanye West."
41-year-old West was called Ye for a while, and he used this abbreviation as the title for his album, released in June.
The change took place on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
On the show, he replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation due to "emotional reasons", the author of the show said.
This is not only an abbreviation of the current professional name, previously West said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe ‘is’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us, we are us.
Kanye, which means “the one,” was shortened to simply being – it’s just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusing, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brother Love.
West's former colleague, J.Z., also experimented with hyphens and capital letters.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador vows not to use army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised never to use the army against civilians. Soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the massacre of students.
On Saturday, in Tlatelolco Square, López Obrador vowed “never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shelled a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those enrolled and opening more free public universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
The US should double its funding in the field of artificial intelligence
As China ramps up its AI activity, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on AI research, according to Kai-Fu Li, an AI investor and practitioner who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the U.S. does not have a formal AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“A double budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next major advance in AI will be made in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Sinovation Ventures Foundation, which has invested in Face++, one of the most famous AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player at Othello, and later served as the executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee noted previous technology competitions held by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when the next ones would be to help identify the next promising participants.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China taking academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring from universities in recent years to work on AI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the United States increase efforts in the field of AI.
“I believe that the Green Card should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, with the quality of academic work in China lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $ 2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As for the National Science Foundation, it now invests more than $ 100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has taken no action for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country’s name
Macedonia's people on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments struck a deal based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the deal argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gheorghe Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and because of the boycott campaign, there are doubts whether the turnout will reach a minimum of 50%, which will allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the referendum ballot is: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU, provided that the agreement with Greece is accepted?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay for joining such bodies as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote does not entail legal obligations, enough members of parliament said they would support it to make it decisive.
A two-thirds vote in parliament is required to change the name.
The state election commission said that no reports of violations were received until 13:00.
However, turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the ballot boxes.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said the 62-year-old Gyoze Tanevski in Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum to change the country’s name, paving the way for accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of tents organized by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go there with our heads held high, not through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring many necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said the “yes” result would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since the beginning of its work in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling passed the defense of Brighton and brought Manchester City a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The goal of Aguero in the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton and found himself in the open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He bypassed one defender, then bypassed several more on the edge of the penalty "Brighton".
Then he made a pass to the left when he saw Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch at the penalty area to give the ball to Aguero, who with his right boot launched it into the right side of the goal, defeating Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at this point.”
But the initial advantage of the sky-blue in this Premier League match was secured by Sterling.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the territory of “Brighton”.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along Leroy Sané's left flank.
Leroy made a few touches and then made a pass to Sterling in the direction of the far rod.
Sky Blue forward threw the ball into the goal just before he slipped out of the line.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to take away the glasses in “Rokis”
Since the Washington Nationals left the playoffs, there were no significant reasons to wait for another start.
But prone to rivalry, Scherzer hopes to reach the pitcher slide on Sunday in a match against the Colorado Rockies, provided that the Rockies will still have difficulty reaching the playoffs. Now, the Rockies are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
The Rockies at least have a wild card for a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still eager to secure their first division title.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, at least we’ll be able to leave the ball knowing how the spectators are behaving here in Denver and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I’ve seen this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?
The Nationals will still announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to believe that it will be Scherzer.
Scherzer, for whom it will be the 34th start, on Thursday held a pitching session and can play on Sunday, his usually weekend.
The Washington Right has a score of 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 of innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The president casually recalled the situation around his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters appearing in the midterm elections.
“Everything we did will be at stake in November.
In five weeks, some of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
It’s one of the big ones, the big ones — I don’t run, but I really run, so wherever I can, I fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power, using any means, you see the meanness, the crap.
They don’t care who suffers from them, who needs to be crossed over in order to gain power and control, they want power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats’ mission, he said, is to “resist and hinder.”
“And you’ve seen it over the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “evil and mean, disgusting and lying.”
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, naming Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which provoked the audience to loud cries of discontent.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you provide a document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting — it was really bad body language — the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to convict me, it almost came as no surprise.
After all, I am the last of those Labour Members who have been told that they are not welcome, and all because we express our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in almost the same way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was convicted for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, these questions are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party said in a statement on Friday: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local Labour Member of Parliament have been like this.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a “more friendly, softer” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began to be implemented.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not allowed in the Labour Party, and each opinion is evaluated from the point of view of whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues with whom I previously thought I had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take positions that I would never agree to, whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak publicly — and it doesn’t matter what I say — it’s followed by a tirade of attacks on social media with calls for withdrawal, condemnation of the center’s politics, I’m told that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments I receive are usually political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily face streams of sexist or racist attacks, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of “distrust” or change in the rules of selection, the party narrows down.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice. I have been urged not to stand out, not to speak so loudly that “everything will be fine” with me.
But that’s not why I came into politics.
I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy because, because of the lack of attention from the Thatcher government, my high school class was literally falling apart, and since then, I've been trying to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether it's a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been embarrassed by my political views and disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday’s events, I want to say only one thing: in an environment where a country is moving towards Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have one more message, not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, as members of the Labour Party, and not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats to withdraw me and no political gain will prevent you all from acting in what I consider to be my best interest.

"Air" 38 - 17 "Melrose": undefeated "Air" rises
The last two attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserved a triumph in today’s great entertainment match of the Premiership of Scotland.
Now they are leading the table, it is the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the excellent defense and improved ability to take advantage of the chances gives the hosts and coach Peter Murchy every right to be satisfied.
“So far we have been tested by our games and we are still undefeated, so I have to be satisfied,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented: "I pay tribute to Air, they used their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, implemented by Frazier Clima, led the Air forward, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, issued by the Verriors, allowed the Melroses to show the numbers, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Klimo strengthened the leadership of "Air" with the help of penalties and just before the break made and implemented a solo attempt, which gave a score of 17-5 in favor of "Air"
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Buggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was taken out of the field on a stretcher, and from the restart the Air broke ahead with the help of Stafford McDowell's attempt, which was implemented by Clima.
Air captain Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay by an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin under fierce pressure.
The hosts returned, but when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball from the penalty area line, McPherson made a touchdown behind Aire Mall.
Klimo implemented the attempt, which he did almost every time after the restart, after which Kyle Rowe received a kick in the box from David Armstrong and sent flanker Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the host team.
It seems that the star of the series "Still a game" is set for a new career in the restaurant sector
It seems that the star of the series "Still a game" Ford Kiran is set for a new career in the hospitality industry. Such a conclusion can be made after it became known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, the script of which he writes and in which he stars with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the series, and Kirnan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun hinted that Kirnan wanted to enter the "prosperous restaurant business" of Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol an equipped fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean-blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
We have to bring him back.”
In landlocked Bolivia, there is still a living memory of the loss of the coastline that ceded Chile in the bloody 19th-century conflict over natural resources, and there is a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are now perhaps the strongest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of hearing the case.
“There is momentum in Bolivia, there is a spirit of unity and calm and, of course, it expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the announcement of the ICJ decision on big screens across the country. They hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia, that after decades of fragmentary talks Chile will be forced to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president who faced opposition to his re-election next year, also has high hopes for a decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if it does, little will change.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to award Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the ICJ’s decision, taken just six months after the final arguments were put forward, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
The case of Bolivia has not progressed, the last four years could contribute to a rollback.
“The issue of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales’ militant rhetoric undermined the remnants of Chilean benevolence, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to put an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calçadia also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never relinquish its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
This resolution is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ree spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the Singapore summit by rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has come to a standstill more than three months after Singapore’s summit with Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the belief that prolonging sanctions and opposing the U.S. declaration of the end of the Korean War will someday bring North Korea to its knees is “an impossible dream.”
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive hats, which is already heading to the main streets of your city
Whether you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a number of eccentric oversize-style hats from the spring-summer 2019 collection on the podiums of the brilliant Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and the named designers have already sent their dizzying creations outside the podium.
Valentino stood out with an extravagant beige hat with wide feathered fields that covered the heads of the models.
Among other oversight accessories are decorated with precious stones watermelons, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple hat, but they are not for keeping your head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks—very timely before Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had sewn lips and more resembled Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One resembled a scuba gear with a tube and glasses, the other looked like a horn of ice cream that had melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you are in luck.
Stylists say that huge hats can go out onto the main streets of your city.
Oversize hats came into fashion thanks to "La Bomba", a straw hat with fields sixty centimeters wide, which was seen on everyone: from Rihanna to Emily Ratazhkovsky.
The iconic brand, behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere on social networks, gave the world another creation: a straw beach bag the size of a model in a swimsuit that carried it.
A yellowish-red raffia bag with a raffia fringe and a white leather handle was a central element of La Riviera spring-summer 2019 collection by Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the influence of the designer is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is mandatory for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain high standards of education, and in 2018 we again received excellent exam results, which are complemented by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
These schools, with more than 30,000 students enrolled across Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SIC). They are committed to providing the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language they understand, they perceive it with their mind.
If you talk to her in her native language, she feels it in her heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot use English alone if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest exam results this year, we see that in independent schools, languages lead in the rankings of the subjects with the best grades.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A score.
Data collected from 74 schools of the SRNSH showed that 72% of students received a higher A score from Chinese, while another 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish also got an A.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now languages as a subject of choice are taught in the same way as NTIM subjects (science, engineering, engineering and mathematics), within the framework of independent school programs and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons employers are unable to close vacancies are due to insufficient language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more promising positions require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if someone has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because it is a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people (15%).
That’s why investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will provide children with a better chance of finding a full-fledged job.
In Scotland, each school will learn their own languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, it will always be possible to choose several languages to study with qualified teachers.
Scottish Independent Schools strive to create a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed regardless of what the future holds for them.
Now it can not be denied that in the international business environment languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should truly be considered “skills of international communication.”
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
It's going to be fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron debuts with the Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see the first start of LeBron James for the Los Angeles Lakers, almost waited.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the first pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play, is not yet decided.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games of the Lakers pre-season schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today begins a series of election rallies from the city of Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including rallies in friendly states including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump is seeking to form support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after a vote in November.
What time will Trump’s rally tonight in West Virginia take place and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to recall the tensions of the hearing this week over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate vote for a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain popularity before the November election.
Representatives for President Trump said the five rallies next week were aimed at “intensifying volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“Control of Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season approaches,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
At the planned at the stadium "Wesbanko Arena" in the city of Wheeling today's rally can come supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
The visit will be Trump’s second in a month to West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, whose rating is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not good for Morrissey that the president is coming to raise his ratings in polls,” Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team is up for the fight and full of hope ahead of Sunday’s singles
After three sessions that ended in a one-sided victory, Saturday afternoon forsoms may be exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
Emergency impulse pendulum is a completely fictional sports concept that players really believe in, especially in such competitions.
So when do they say that the impulse is working?
“They were six points ahead and now they’re four, so I think we’re taking it a little bit as an impulse,” Jordan Spit said as he left.
Europe has an advantage, of course, four points ahead and another twelve in the game.
Americans feel a little bit of wind in their sails, as well as being encouraged by many, not least the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each earned three points out of four.
The singing with his murderous blows from the ti-stage to the green shows an example.
These laryngeal chants of celebration became louder when, in the continuation of his round, he made a decisive patt and leveled the score on the fourth match after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His patt, who allowed them to win a 15-hole match, was met with a similar shout, one that tells you that the American team is not giving up.
“You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own match,” Spit said.
That’s all the players have left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe has four out of four and can not make mistakes.
The Mollywoods were the only couple who did not make boggi on Saturday afternoon, they also managed to avoid boggi on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and on the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This run and how their energy seems to flow to this tumultuous crowd and back makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players besides Fleetwood or Molinari to cement a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the triumph of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of morning forball, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One boggi and two doubles on the first nine holes led the Spaniard and the Swede to a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
Forballs and forsoms are very interesting to watch from up close through the interactions between the couple’s participants, through the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and it’s also interesting to watch how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe still plays better as a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of force also showed that the US team intends to fight, which some, especially the Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with a score of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's forbols and forsoms, it is ahead of the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the duo won two victories over the lagging Tiger Woods, and now have four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Björn’s European team, which is trying to regain the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in morning forball with a 3-1 score.
The U.S. made greater resistance in force and won two matches, but was unable to narrow the gap.
Jim Fourik's team needed eight points in 12 Sunday singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Mollynari (along with Mollywood) are only the second pair to score four points in the first four games of Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in forballs, they teamed up to defeat the swollen Woods and newcomer American Bryson Deschambeau with an even more spectacular 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of genius, but so far he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in forball and forceball and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning forballs, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in force to get a 2-to-1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the world rankings.
Europe could not do everything in its own way on this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
Three main winners Jordan Speath and Justin Thomas on Saturday set the standard for Americans with their two points.
They won a decisive 2–1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Poulter in forball and later defeated Poulter and Rory McLroy with a score of 4–3 in forsoms, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did the team return with a four-point deficit in singles, although Fourik's team only needed a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it is beyond their power.
North Korea says ‘no way’ will disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions would deepen distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would in no way be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong-ho told the annual UN General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken “substantial goodwill measures” such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and committing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
And while Ri repeated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement proved important in that it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization that Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ree cited a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the incumbent U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and raises the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
“To believe that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the extension of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ree did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the party to this denuclearization issue, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a dead end.”
Despite this, the tone of Ree’s speech differed sharply from last year when he told the General Assembly that North Korea’s missile targeting of the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” who wanted to commit suicide.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was much more to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not set a timeline for this: “It will take two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and steadily until we see a complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for "gangster demands".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes “appropriate measures”.
He said he needed “appropriate measures” to guarantee the security that Trump promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to relax enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has provided all of its students with more sleep. It is an attempt to combat the growing culture of steep learning all night after refueling with caffeine.
The teacher found that the world’s number one university students are often uneducated when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end, one girl came up to him and said, “Why am I being told this now, in my final year?”
“She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” the teacher told The Telegraph.
In the course, which was introduced for the first time this year, students are explained the basics of how good sleep habits help achieve academic and athletic results, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s medical services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was discovered that students were severely deprived of sleep within a week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dorm room where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, exercise machines and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performance, and the importance of sleep-related routines.
Another section tells participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Further, the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Chaysler.
A culture of pride in staying awake all night still exists, he added, noting that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even with an excess of weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a mode of starvation that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheysler design the course after enrolling in one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all graduate students with a request to undergo a similar program of study before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chaysler recommends that students put a reminder to go to bed, as well as to put on an alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” that is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, which leads to problems with falling asleep.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": the goal of Menga upset the guys Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another attack of away grief: Dolly Menga's strike brought Steven Gerrard's divided team a 1-0 defeat to Livingston.
The Ibrox team sought their first away win after a 4–1 win over St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games. Gerrard's team was eight points behind the Scottish Prem.
Meng scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lacked inspiration, did not look like they could equalize the score.
Now, the Rangers have fallen to sixth position, and Livingston have risen to third, and only Hibernian are ahead of them by the difference of the balls.
In addition, the "Rangers" may encounter another trouble, because the lineman Callum Spence was forced to process the head wound after the guest sector in him threw some object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that once flew past Eyre to the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
And Holt released the same Left 11 line-up that scored one point at the Harts last week, and was delighted with how his compelled guys squeezed rivals at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingston have worked more with the resulting ball.
They were supposed to score after just two minutes of play, when the first pass of Menga into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed this big chance by sending the ball past the goal.
Keagan Jacobs' deep free kick went to Skipper Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow hit the rear pole.
The Rangers did gain control, but in the last third there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should be entitled to a penalty at a quarter-hour mark after colliding with Stephen Lawless, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers managed to make only two strikes in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's calm strike.
And although the goal of Livingston at 34 minutes may have contradicted the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only by their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' workout.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Menga for a simple finish.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this change worked almost immediately when the winger made his way to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to make guests play the kind of game they liked when Lithgow and Hulkett made one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved in the final stages, but McGregor did well against Jacobs before Lithgow hit from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, made another late application for a penalty when confronted by Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and time is running out... in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that evolved over time into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's counting has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film The Coronado Bells, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play dubious-looking cowboy scientists.
Man: “What is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear how the radioactivity in the minerals affects the atoms.”
Evans: "Well, it's really cracking right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, which is part of the treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient and their change in the laboratory
These cells are then able to “see” a protein that is common to many types of cancer. Then these cells are again injected into the patient.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can “see” the common cancer protein (HER2), and then re-injecting these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of several cancers’, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers,” he explained.
A similar approach, which consists in extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to target cancer cells, worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
After appearing in the studio of the show SNL in a baseball cap MAGA Kanye West gave a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
What caused the negative reaction of the viewers
Spectators at the SNL (Saturday Night Live) show squeaked Kanye after his tumultuous performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in a baseball cap that read “Bring America Back to Former Glory,” he burst out with a tirade in which he criticized the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"Often in conversation, white people ask me, 'How can you like Trump? He's a racist.'
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a lawsuit against Christine Blasey Ford for sexual assault.
Although West's speech was not broadcast live, a video of his tirade was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting this post.
West also complained to the audience that behind the scenes with him happened an unpleasant situation through the hat.
According to the Washington Examiner, West said: "When I was behind the scenes, I was treated rudely.
I was told, “Don’t go out to the audience in this baseball cap.”
They mocked me!
And then I’m told I’m in a place where the oppressed are silent.”
West continued, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'm going to put on my Superman baseball cap because that way no one will be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love.”
As reported by the weekly Variety, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction of the audience in the hall, and the actors of the show SNL looked confused. One of the viewers said: "The studio was dead silence."
Vesta was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before the broadcast.
West stunned many by performing the song I Love It (I Love It) in a Perrier water bottle costume.
Vesta was backed by TPUSA chairwoman Candace Turner, who tweeted, "One of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR standing up to NATO."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is who he is, and that's just great."
"However, I will NOT reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who, in my opinion, professes and erupts an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she added.
Before performing on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: he is now "the one formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name. He follows the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was formerly known as Snoop Lyon, and the music legend of recent decades Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then became "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder after knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed another man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast magistrates' court on Monday.
The prosecution will consider the charges.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington condemns the idealization of brutality
Keith Harrington became famous for his role as a warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones" produced by HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor has spoken out against the hero-macho stereotype, arguing that because of such heroes on screens, young boys often seem to have to become cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought "something went wrong" and asked how to address the problem of the idealization of brutality in the era of the #MeTo hashtag.
Cat, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, said he was “quite determined” to tackle the issue.
"I'm quite determined at the moment. When did we get on the slippery path of idealizing brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men when we look at their growing up through the lens of the problem we see now?"
Cat believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality through depictions of extraordinarily courageous heroes.
He continued: “What is natural, and what is planted in us?
Why does television and the street teach that young men feel pressured to be such men?
In my opinion, the really important question today is “How can we change this?”
“It’s clear that the young people are on the wrong track.”
In the interview, he also noted that he would not appear in any of the sequels to Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, as "I'm done with the battles and the horses."
From November, Keith will play in the production of the play "True West" by Sam Shepard - a story about the film producer and his robber brother.
As the actor recently admitted, he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best he received from participation in the series "Game of Thrones".
“During the filming of this series, I met my wife, so she gave me a future family and defined my future life,” said Cat.
In the fantasy series, which won the Emmy Awards, Rose played Igritt - the love of the hero of Harington John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018. The ceremony took place on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Says 14% Rise in New Cases
In China, a sharp increase of 14% in the number of citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS was reported.
According to health authorities, there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, indicating a change in the past trend.
For a long time, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions in some regions of China.
However, health officials said during a conference in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
Sexual transmission of HIV in time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to research, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men later marry women because of the dominance of conservative values in the country.
Transmission of the disease in most cases occurs as a result of improper use of protective means during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to ensure free access to HIV medicines, seeing this as a partial solution to the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leakage of Republican senators’ data to the network by her full-time employee and sharply criticizes “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denounced unsubstantiated allegations that one of her full-time employees posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
A Los Angeles-based Democrat says the allegations are being disseminated by “ultra-right” political columnists and websites.
“Lies, lies, and then even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The information contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch of Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing in the Senate commission on allegations of unlawful acts of a sexual nature, brought against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the post of judge of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The leak came some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill reported that on such conservative websites as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the IP address of the source of the leak is associated with the office of Waters and behind it managed to find the data of her full-time employee.
“These unfounded claims are absolutely false, they are not true,” Waters continued.
“An employee of my office, whose personal data and security has been compromised as a result of these fabricated and false statements, has nothing to do with the leak of this information.
These unfounded statements are absolutely false, they do not correspond to reality.”
The statement was quickly criticized online, among others, by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she cannot be a member of Congress with that character.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, there is no need to be angry.
The defendant must not act impudently.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and unmoved.”
Fleischer seems to have drawn parallels between Waters' reaction and Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to take Waters' place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“This is so news if it’s really true,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had already notified "relevant state and law enforcement authorities of these false statements".
"We will do everything possible to find those responsible," she continued, "and they have responded to the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
Review of the film "Agent Johnny English: A New Mission" – a passing parody of spy militants with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look in every new British film for meanings inspired by Brexit. They are also in the new part of the series of comedy parodies on Johnny English. The first film called "Johnny English" was released in 2003, later the series was renewed in 2011, filming "Johnny Ingish"
Will the ridiculous-ironical self-satisfaction about how miserable we are become a new export potential of the nation?
One way or another, Johnny English, with his moving face and flabby eyes, was given a second chance to make a mess, with his name more than anything else indicating that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
As you know, Johnny is a hilariously cheerful secret agent, in whom, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, there is a little from Inspector Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bean and a lot from the guy who played one note of the tune from the movie "Fire chariots" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
A prototypical character is also a traveler and a mystery of an international scale, which always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten television commercial of Barclaycard.
In the last film about Johnny English there are a few good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny English in his knightly armor approached the helicopter, and the propeller blades snapped at his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for buffooning is well-revealed, but humor is transient, and at some points it is too much, especially when compared to "serious" film brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible", one of the "ingredients" of which is also a comedy.
It seems that jokes are meant for children rather than adults, and I don’t find the ridiculous things that happen to Johnny English to be as inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson’s jokes in the silent Bean films.
As always, the film begins with the fact that a serious threat looms over the UK.
The British super-secret spy network is infiltrated by a hacker and reveals the names of all field agents, which was a complete surprise for the acting agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played in the film only an episodic role).
This turned out to be the last straw for the Prime Minister, a proud person who has already suffered devastating criticism and is in deep depression due to the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried her best to convey the image inspired by Theresa May, but the script was not able to fully reveal it).
Intelligence advisers have informed her that all active agents have been compromised and she needs to involve someone from the retired.
The choice falls on the awkward Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some super-fashionable institution and unofficially teaches children how to operate undercover (in this part with the spy "school of the year" English for teenagers there were several successful jokes).
English is quickly taken to Whitehall for an urgent briefing, where he meets again with his long-suffering buddy Buff, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine captain (the role of an exalted annoying person does not quite match the talent of Vicki Pepperdine).
So, when everything in Her Majesty's Secret Service is gone, "Batman and Robin" return to the line and unexpectedly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistol, played by Olga Kurylenko.
And at this time, the Prime Minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who has made his fortune in the field of technology and claims that he can fix the problem with the British network - the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff go on a journey and again resort to their ridiculous tricks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a chic French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally going abroad on a luxury yacht Volta.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but with his good spirits and madness, he somehow resembles a movie for children.
A passing film.
As with other Johnny English films, I asked myself the same question: Can the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour rejects a plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but be paid five days a week
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is set to discuss a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but be paid five days a week.
It is reported that the party wants to oblige the heads of companies to transfer the money saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence to workers, giving them an extra day off.
Workers will have a three-day day off and will bring home the same salary.
According to the sources, this idea will correspond to the economic program of the party and will direct the country’s resources to support the working class.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved at the British Trade Union Congress. It is seen that in this way workers will be able to benefit from the change in the overall economic situation.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the Party’s approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as to the Party’s overall industrial strategy.
Labour is not the first to endorse this idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment approve of this aspiration.
The Labour Party speaker said: "The political program of the party does not provide for the introduction of a four-day working week, so we are not considering this idea at the moment."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party’s election congress last week.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” of utilities and “searchers.”
The “shadow” chancellor’s plan also means that shareholders of water companies may not get their full share of capital if the Labour government introduces “deductions” on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers in the board of companies and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of ordinary shares of private sector firms to workers who are expected to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy talk on the 60 Minutes show about whether the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, which is led by the FBI, the final vote for his appointment to the post of Supreme Court Justice has been postponed for at least a week. The question arises whether the Republican senators will continue to support Kavanaugh after the results of the investigation of the Bureau.
On Sunday’s 60 Minutes show, Scott Pelley, a correspondent, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
During the hearing, I said that I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it all happened and the accusation came out, I asked him, “Did you really do this?”
He was determined, unshakable, uncompromising.”
It seems that Graham's opinion will not change anything.
“I believe that bringing Kavanaugh to justice is a provocation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied everything,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And everyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t know what can change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how can it reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival – an annual event in the music world with a staggering number of star performers and an equally astonishing mission – to overcome poverty around the world.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the true purpose of the festival – the organizers are striving to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international non-governmental organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to an event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors must complete a number of tasks or "actions", such as taking a volunteer project, writing an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else to help draw attention to the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So are there any results already, because the organizers of Global Citizen have 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding for an act with a free concert really a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” when people feel they are really making a difference by signing an e-petition or posting on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “acts” of their supporters aimed at achieving various goals.
The organization claims that these actions prompted world leaders to announce more than $37 billion in funding and programs that will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 financial commitments and public statements as an example of its performance, with at least $10 billion already collected and spent.
According to the group, the funds provided have already directly affected the lives of approximately 649 million people around the world.
Among the main financial commitments are the fund The Power of Nutrition (Power of Nutrition), which is territorially related to the UK. As part of the project, investors and implementers committed themselves to "help children grow up" and promised to provide Rwanda with $ 35 million in aid to overcome the problem of malnutrition organization after receiving more than 4,700 reports citer in t
“With the support of the UK government, philanthropists, governments elsewhere and citizens like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history,” said Tracy Ullman, a spokeswoman for The Power of Nutrition, speaking to the public at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also said that after 5,000 “acts” calling for better nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on his website, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen said: “It’s a long and difficult journey, so sometimes we’ll fail and fail.
“However, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Jianell Mona are just a few of the star performers who will perform at the New York City festival this year, with Deborah-Lee Farness and Hugh Jackman leading the show.
The interior minister said that the United States can use naval forces for the “blockade” to prevent the export of Russian energy resources.
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke quoted in the Washington Examiner as saying that Washington could “if necessary” seek help from the navy to prevent Russian energy resources from entering markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke said Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that they are in the Middle East because they want to become an intermediary in energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
“Thanks to the U.S. Navy, it can provide free passage through sea routes and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that positions itself as the “voice of every consumer” in the United States.
He then compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
“The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy resources efficiently and replace them with alternatives,” he said, calling Russia “unilaterally developed” because its economy depends on energy carriers of mineral origin.
While these statements were being made, the Trump administration set out to increase exports of compressed natural gas to Europe, displacing Russian-origin energy from the market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To do this, Trump administration officials and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which costs $ 11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington is fiercely opposed to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I don’t like it when a third country interferes in our energy supplies,” Dieter Kempf, the head of the German Federal Industry Association, said after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s last meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren "will think seriously" about running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously think" about running for president after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Goliath, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for president.
According to The Hill, Warren said: "It's time for women to go to Washington and get a government job, and for that, a woman should be at the head of the government."
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
During a public meeting, Warren expressed her appreciation of Donald Trump’s presidency, saying he was “leading his country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been candid in her criticism of Trump and his proposed candidacy for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "... undoubtedly, the FBI should conduct an investigation before the vote."
However, according to poll results released on Friday, most Warren voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
According to a survey conducted jointly by the University of Suffolk Center for Policy Studies and The Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential Massachusetts voters opposed the senator’s nomination.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The results of the poll showed that the former governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support. 38% voted for his potential nomination for the post of President, against - 48%.
During the discussions of the nominations of other well-known Democrats who can run in 2020, also called the former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin during a rally in support of Donald Trump
26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence. The incident occurred on Monday night.
“What my son is going through now, what he is going through when he returns, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are returning home with,” she told a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called Trek's arrest a "problem that nobody cares about" and said her son and other war veterans "are returning home differently from what they used to be, more cruelly, and want to know if what their fellow soldiers, pilots and other military personnel have done for this country is respected here."
Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett said Trek was arrested Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assaulting a woman, as well as obstructing a report of a violent incident and carrying a gun while intoxicated.
18 States and District of Columbia Support Appeals to Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies refugee status to victims of harassment and domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives from 18 states and the county sent an analytical note to the court consultant in Washington to support the claimant in need of asylum and challenged the policy in court.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case following the American Civil Rights Union lawsuit, which challenged federal policy and was filed in August, is not disclosed.
The plaintiff said her partner "and his brutal bandit sons" had beaten her, but U.S. officials refused her when she applied for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
Prosecutors supporting Grace’s lawsuit said residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (of which refugees often seek asylum in the U.S.) often face serious problems such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee policy overturns the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, according to which undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Carl Racine said in a speech Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state laws, federal and international laws."
"Federal law requires that decisions on applications for refugee status be based on consideration of the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the prohibition violates this principle," the court's advisor said in an analytical note.
Further in the analytical note, prosecutors cite arguments that the policy, which prohibits immigrants from entering the United States, harms the country's economy, since they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "refill the necessary labor resources".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a warrant for immigration judges in June saying they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain civic groups or political views,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems, even those serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers are desperate to find the survivors, while the death toll in Palu has doubled.
For the survivors, the situation continues to deteriorate.
“The situation is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother, reassuring her boy with a fever at the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance brings the bodies.
There is not enough clean water.”
Some residents return to their ruined homes, searching for flooded possessions, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the quake, which was 7.5 on the Richter scale, were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Geris with a fractured back and shoulder, are resting near the Palu Army Hospital building, where patients are being treated in the open air due to repeated tremors.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recalled how a strong tremor shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I’m trapped in the wreckage of the wall,” Garris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife begging for help, and then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Psychological Pressure’ Using ‘Propaganda-Included Ads’
A week after a state-run Chinese newspaper ran four pages of U.S. daily newspaper advertising material on the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited a paid app by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s most popular newspaper, after accusing China of trying to influence the November 6 congressional elections. China rejects these accusations.
U.S. officials said Trump’s statements accusing Beijing of attempting to interfere in the U.S. election mark a new phase of escalation by Washington aimed at putting pressure on China.
While foreign governments may place advertisements to boost trade, an escalation in the trade war between Beijing and Washington is taking place in time, as part of which they have already raised import duties.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the imposition of repressive tariffs in China was intended to strike at exporters from states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brensted wrote in a column in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, is “increasing pressure by publishing propaganda ads in our independent press.”
“To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the tradition of freedom of speech and independence of the press, which is common to the American people, by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Brenstead wrote.
"In contrast, on the street layouts here in Beijing, you will find only some voices of dissenters. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people are really thinking about the direction of development of the Chinese economy, which is a concern, from which it can be concluded that the media of China are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most respected Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but did not name which one.
Analysts warn that with the failure of Kavanaugh, Republicans are turning female voters against themselves before the midterm elections
With many well-known Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh after he was charged with several sexual harassment charges, analysts warn it could trigger undesirable reactions ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, especially among women.
There are passions raging around this situation, and most Republicans publicly declare that they would like to go to the polls.
Such things can’t then just be played back,” Grant Rieger, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told The Hill on Saturday.
Rieger expressed doubts that the FBI investigation, which Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Republican) insisted at the last minute, would be enough to calm angry voters.
According to the Washington, D.C. edition, the chief adviser and spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn, Catherine Jean-Perrier, said on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it, neither tomorrow nor in November.”
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters sang "November is Coming!" during a demonstration in the Legal Committee, when Republicans decided to move ahead with the approval of Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazy Ford.
In an interview with the news website, Stu Rotenberg, a non-party political columnist, said: "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
“They say it’s happening now, and it’s true.
However, motivation may increase, especially among female voters aged 18-29 from the suburbs, who are still undecided and often do not vote if they do not like the president.
Even before Ford testified in connection with the Supreme Court candidate’s accusations of a sex offense, analysts predicted a negative voter response if Republicans insisted on approval.
Earlier this week, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said: “This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party.”
As Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA (a group that helps Democrats in the election campaign), said in an interview with the news channel, “it’s not about the committee’s vote, the final vote or how Kavanaugh ended up on the bench, but how they reacted to it.”
However, the opinions of Americans about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Kavanaugh, are divided.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe Ford’s testimony, while 35% of respondents believe or rather believe Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents noted that, in their opinion, Kavanaugh gave or most likely gave false testimony, while about Ford said the same 30% of respondents.
According to The Guardian, following Flake's insistence, the FBI is reviewing the accusations made by Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee about how Kavanaugh attacked her while intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez said a candidate for Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals at a party during their Yale studies in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a “new Internet” to create competition between Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Internet, is launching a new startup to create competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of the world of technology, the company Inrupt, is engaged in the development of the open source platform Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and who to give access to this or that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which will allow users to create a "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can store contact lists, current to-do lists, calendar, audio library, and other tools for your own use and work.
It’s like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of this personal online data store is that it fully meets the needs of the user, who can access any information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the company aims to leverage resources, processes and relevant skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, several full-time developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own standalone apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all of their business models are undergoing drastic changes in a short period of time.
“We don’t ask their permission.”
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to “provide commercial energy and ecosystems and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate over net neutrality.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the next era of network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: celebration on the occasion of the presentation of the representative of the Church of the Order of the "Cross of Victoria" in the years of the First World War
The only representative of the Church of England, who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria for his participation in the fighting during the First World War, is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his participation in the attack at Bellengliz and Leocourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper bullet four days later and never found out that he had received Britain's highest military award.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, called it "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather accomplished the feat for which he received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vanne moved his battalion through the canal of Saint-Cattain "through a very thick fog and under dense fire of field guns and machine guns".
Later he hastened to the firing line and with "desperate courage" led the line forward, before this one broke through to the field gun and destroyed three guns of the enemy unit.
Lt. Col. Wanna was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather had done something he himself would never have done and deserved respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Wann laid the wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud to take part in this parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the respect shown to him by so many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, and instead they were shown "Pig Peppa"
Imagine staying up all night just to watch the eventful Bellator 206 tournament and being denied the chance to watch the main event.
The tournament, which was held in San Jose, featured 13 fights, including six matches of the main program, which were broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just before Gegard Moussassi and Rory McDonald were getting ready to fight, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the fight.
Some spectators weren’t thrilled with this, as they didn’t sleep until the very morning, waiting for the fight.
One fan tweeted that switching to a children's cartoon was "some kind of failed joke".
“According to the government’s decree, the content that aired at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to play a children’s show,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and public relations, when asked about the show.
Peppa Pig, yes.
Bellator President Scott Cocker has promised to work on the schedule of broadcasts to reach viewers in the UK in the future.
“I think if we talk about repeating the broadcast, then we can arrange it,” said Cooker.
“But now there is a Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can’t do anything until we have a Sunday, and they have a Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages to which we responded, and the text of those messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical problem and tried to fix it.
However, it turned out that it was a non-compliance with government regulations.
I can promise you this will never happen again.
We will reduce the tournament to five fights instead of six as usual. We tried to redirect the signal to the fans, but so far we have postponed these attempts.
It’s a really unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels “Worst” Than Others Because of His Sexual Orientation
Olympic water jumper Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he did not understand that "not everyone is like him" until he went to high school.
Participating in the broadcast of the Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he noted that he spoke openly about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that because of paternity, he became less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The host, Kirsty Young, who has been running the program for a long time, has been hospitalized for several months.
Arriving as a paria on Laverne's first show, Daly said he felt "worse" than others as a child because "society did not accept when someone liked boys and girls".
He said, "Until now, the feeling of inferiority and difference was exactly what gave me the drive and strength to succeed."
According to him, he sought to prove that something is "worthy" so as not to disappoint all those who eventually learned about his orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known champion of LGBT rights and has taken advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke openly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion admitted that feelings for his husband, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was a real surprise for him.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years older than him last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” (he played at the first Olympics at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it’s hard to find someone his age who would have experienced similar ups and downs as well.
In June, the couple had a son, named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and since then, according to the Daily, his "perception" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, I would only think about getting gold,” he said.
"You know, there are things that are much more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not put up with the idea of the end and before he died asked if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him you weren’t going to sit in the front row because you weren’t going to be around anymore,” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daly took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life: to dive in front of my compatriots at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that,” Daley said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song, Proud, performed by Heather Small, which resonated with him in preparation for the Olympics and still evokes ants.
The Desert Island Discs program airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
On Saturday, from the match of the tournament for the "Ryder's Cup" brought Mikkelson, who was out of shape
American Phil Mickelson set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the tournament for the "Ryder Cup", but he has to restore form, so that this event does not become unhappy for him.
Mickelson, who participates in the tournament, which takes place every two years for a record 12th time, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Fourik for the duration of Forballs and Forces.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner cheered the team all day and trained aside, hoping to master the emotions.
Since Mickelson was not famous for striking punches even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete was not quite suitable for the difficult golf course Le Golf National, where the raft usually punishes for wandering punches.
And if the field itself is not such an obstacle, in the ninth match on Sunday Mickelson will have to meet the champion of the Open Championship and the master of precise shot Francesco Molinari, who paired with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all his matches this week.
If the Americans, who are three points behind after 12 singles matches, start well, Mickelson’s match may be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his athlete, and, probably, besides this, he had nothing to add.
"He fully understood his role today, slapped me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has no doubts about his ability.
Mickelson is a member of the Hall of Fame who has done so much for the teams last week and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play in two games.
I predicted more matches, but it turned out that way, so we decided to act like this.
He wants to be there, on the field, just like everyone else.”
If Mickelson goes on the field on Saturday, he will break the record of Nick Faldo, who played the most matches in the tournament "Ryder's Cup".
With this, he may end his career in the Ryder Cup tournament, which has never corresponded to his individual achievements.
Mikelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Fourik said his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
“He’s funny, capricious, witty, he likes to joke with others, he’s a guy that’s great to have in a team,” Fourik explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun bumping into him and this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He’s more than just a player.”
European team captain Thomas Björn knows big break doesn’t solve anything
Thomas Björn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a tangible break before the singles matches of the last day of the tournament for the Ryder Cup does not guarantee victory.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but won the match with a slight margin of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big gap in the match at the Valderrama; a big gap in Brooklyn, where we lost, and at the Valderrama, where we barely won," Björn said after watching the winning games Class 2018 with a score of 5:3.
So history teaches me and every player on the team that nothing has been decided yet.
We have to play tomorrow with maximum efficiency.
Go out on the field and do whatever it takes.
The game will be finished only after the result appears on the scoreboard.
We have a goal – to win this trophy, and that’s what we want.
As I said before, I’m focusing on the 12 players on our team, but we’re well aware of who’s up against us – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult field, Björn added: "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow, things can be different.
We’re going to have a game tomorrow, that’s another thing.
It’s great to play on the field with a partner when things are going well, but it’s just when you’re standing there alone that you can check out what you’re worth as a golfer.
Here’s how to set up the players to perform tomorrow: on the verge of opportunity.
You leave your partner without support and now he also has to show what he is capable of."
Unlike Björn, Jim Furyck's opposing number expects his partners to play better on an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Until Fourik himself, fate on the last day turned different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but was defeated when the team from Europe created "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the team’s captain in 1999, organized the players before the final day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to one side, players in the middle of the distance are subjected to special pressure.
We put the players in the team accordingly, as if we were going to do something incredible tomorrow.”
Thomas was commissioned to try to lead the counteroffensive in the top match against Rory McIlroy, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
“It is these partners, and in this order, that I chose because I want to distribute efforts evenly throughout the game,” Björn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The introduction of a new German warship was postponed again
The state-of-the-art frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be put into operation in 2014 instead of outdated Cold War warships. However, according to local media, this will not happen at least until next year due to faulty systems and a rapid increase in costs.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, received from the spokesman of the military department, the commissioning of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the series of the most modern frigates of the class "Baden-Württemberg", postponed until the first half of 2019.
The vessel was supposed to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but problems that arose after the shipment harmed the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which the Navy ordered in 2007, are to replace the outdated frigates of the Bremen class.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies to reduce visibility, in particular, radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance period. It is expected that the new frigates will not be able to return to the port of deployment for about two years.
However, Die Zeit journalists warn that because of the constant delays, state-of-the-art warships, which were supposed to strengthen Germany’s military power at sea, will also become obsolete at the time of commissioning.
The long-suffering frigate F125 hit the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a warship has been returned to a shipbuilding company after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned significant "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship unfit for military operations.
The shortcomings of the software are of particular importance, since the crew of the ship of the Baden-Württemberg class consists of about 120 sailors - this is only half the number of soldiers who served on the old frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it turned out that the ship has a significant excess weight, which worsens its performance and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
The Rhineland-Pfalz frigate is believed to be twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros turned into a colossal 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion US dollars).
Problems with obtaining new frigates have gained particular importance in the light of recent warnings about the decline of the German naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the Bundestag’s commissioner for the armed forces, said that the navy of the country had “a small number of ships suitable for combat missions”.
The official said the situation had deteriorated rapidly over time, as the old ships were decommissioned and new ones did not arrive.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to replenish the navy.
The National Trust will observe the secret lives of bats
The new study, which is being conducted on land tenure in the Scottish Highlands, aims to establish how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals, in order to conduct measures for their preservation in the future.
In the gardens of Inverry in Wester-Rosse, scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will observe species such as the dwarf bat and the pygmy bat, as well as the common earfish and the water nightshade.
Special registrars will be placed in strategic locations on the territory of the land tenure to observe the behavior of bats during the season.
Employees and volunteers of the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile research using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and affiliation of bat cries.
Then it is planned to develop a detailed map of the animal’s habitat and prepare a report to link the behavior of animals with their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the Scottish National Trust, hopes the findings will help determine which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of habitat care measures (e.g. meadow formation) and identify optimal forest conservation practices for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations have declined significantly in Scotland and the UK.
They are threatened by active construction and development of territories, which deprives them of places of nesting.
Other negative factors include wind turbines and lighting, adhesive paper for flies, chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
The rats are not actually blind.
However, hunting at night makes the ears more effective at catching prey than the eyes.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on the flight path.
The National Trust of Scotland, which oversees over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance, and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide, takes bat problems very seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly carry out surveys, inspections of nesting sites and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland. It is located on the territory of the Trivee estate in the Dumfries and Galloway area. It sheltered eight of the ten bat species that live in Scotland.
The site manager David Thompson argues that this is the perfect place for them.
"There are excellent conditions for bats on the territory of the Trivet site," he assures.
"There are old buildings, many giant trees and other favorable living conditions.
But we still have a lot to learn about bats, and with the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we're going to be able to learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the area for bats before carrying out any technical work, since the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for the breeding of young can kill up to 400 females with cubs, which is likely to destroy the entire local population.
Bats and their nests are protected by law. Animals are forbidden to kill, torture or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Centre, urged the public to join the organization's efforts.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats. We still haven't revealed the characteristics of many species' populations."
Ronaldo denies rape charges, and his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German edition
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “defamation” and said people were “trying to get attention” using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published information about the suspicions.
The American Catherine Mayorga accused the forward of the national team of Portugal and the football club "Juventus" in the rape that occurred in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to Der Spiegel magazine on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her $375,000 for her silence.
A few hours after the charges were brought, the 33-year-old Ronaldo appealed to 142 million of his fans in a video stream on Instagram, calling the corresponding messages “slander”.
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today’s accusations are libel,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner said on camera.
“They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to take advantage of me, but situations like this are part of my job.
I’m a happy person and I’m fine,” the footballer added, smiling.
According to the Reuters news agency, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the published accusations, which they called “an unacceptable message of suspicion in the sphere of private life”.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damage in an amount consistent with the seriousness of the violation, which is arguably one of the most notorious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a Palms Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after the meeting in the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's number, where he allegedly raped her anally. Such testimony was transferred to the district court of Clark County (Nevada).
Mayorga says that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees in front of her and said that he was "99 percent a good guy", who was summed up by "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital, where the injuries she received were photographed. However, she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement, as she was "fearful of revenge" and wary of "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman now seeks to cancel the previous arrangement as she continues to suffer because of an incident she said took place.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was preparing to transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United. This summer, he became a player of the grand of Italian football, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will “forever regret” the loss of automakers
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, Economy Minister Greg Clark warns.
He added that he was alarmed by a statement from Toyota UK, which told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the company would be forced to suspend production and operation of its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Secretary Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU as a matter of urgency at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s CEO at Bernaston.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about the impact of Britain’s exit from the EU without an agreement on international trade.
For example, BMW said that the production plant of the Mini model in Oxford will be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of automakers are that a no-deal Brexit could pose risks to supply chains.
Toyota’s production line operates in an expeditious supply of parts and materials according to needs – parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be shortages of parts at the border, leading to delays and shortages of materials.
As noted in the company, in the warehouse Toyota can be placed parts no more than for one day. Therefore, production will have to stop.
Greg Clark noted that the plan for the organization of relations with the EU prepared by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), "separately provides for schemes to avoid problems at the border."
"We need a deal. We need to make an optimal deal, which, in my opinion, will allow not only to achieve success at the current moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the program Today on BBC Radio 4.
“Given the testimony of Toyota and other automakers, it is imperative that we maintain the established high-performance supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be stopped, but in the long run, it expects that the increase in costs will lead to a decrease in the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, will force the reduction of jobs.
Peter Tzuvalaris, chairman of the Unite organizing committee at the Bernaston plant, who worked here for 24 years, said the other participants were extremely concerned: “From experience, I can say that the cuts in jobs are not being restored.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for shaping our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, says White House
White House officials said on Sunday that a responsible meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as discussions continue over Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy for Supreme Court Justice.
Rosenstein oversees Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's election meddling, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For several months, Washington has been discussing the possibility of firing the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of early termination of the presidency under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House amid reports that the official was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he “wouldn’t like” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a time-lapse with a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a vote in the Senate.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date for the meeting. Perhaps it will take place this week. I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I'm constantly making sure that the press has the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the infrequent briefings were not due to an aversion to the "game of publicity" on the part of television reporters, although she added: "I will not deny that they are playing the public."
She then suggested that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
“The president answers questions more often than any president before him,” she said, adding, without citing a source: “The statistics speak for themselves.”
Sanders said the briefings would still be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask a question to the president of the United States, it’s better than talking to me.”
We try to communicate often with the press. This should be especially noticeable over the last few weeks. The opportunity to talk to the President of the United States is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly responds to questions during events outside the White House, public meetings or press conferences with senior guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, acting in front of journalists in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way.
Scotland's health secretary writes to EU workers over concerns over Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health addressed in a letter to citizens of other EU countries who work for the National Health Service of Scotland to express gratitude for their work and ask to continue it after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain’s departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of applications for permanent immigrant status for EU citizens working in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman noted: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued on the issue of withdrawal. Already this fall, we should wait for appropriate decisions.
But the UK government is stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know that this period can be very disturbing for you.
That is why I would like to emphasize once again how I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and beyond share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving healthcare services for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home. We really want you to stay."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Christian Abercrombie underwent an urgent operation after suffering a head injury in Sunday's match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, which his team lost with a score of 31:27. This was reported by a journalist Tennessean.
The head coach of the Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
“He came to the side line where he was sick,” Reid said.
Behind the line, coaches and medical staff gave Ebercrombie oxygen before picking him up on a stretcher for further examination.
A Tennessee State Tigers official told Chris Harris of WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie had operated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no evidence of the type and severity of the injury." The Tennessee State Tigers are trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a sophomore, spent his first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after moving from Illinois.
He made five interceptions of the ball on Sunday before leaving the game, thus having 18 interceptions per season.
Foreign buyers will pay more state duty if they purchase real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay more duty if they purchase real estate in the UK. Under the new Tory plans, additional funds will be spent to help the homeless
This event neutralizes all attempts of Corbyn to attract young voters
Higher state duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise an additional 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
As Theresa May announced today, foreigners buying real estate in the UK will pay more duties. Additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless.
The move could be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing aimed at high-paid workers.
The increase in the duty will apply to individuals and legal entities that do not pay taxes in the UK. Additional funds will be directed by the government to help those who are forced to spend the night in the open air.
The additional duty, which accompanies an increase of two years old on second housing and real estate intended for lease, may be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
According to experts, 13% of new real estate, which is being built in London, falls into the property of foreign citizens. This leads to an increase in prices and complicates the task for those who only dream of their own housing.
Many affluent areas of the country, in particular, in the capital, are empty, as a large number of foreign buyers most of the time live outside the country.
The new plan comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for lowering the state duty to make housing more affordable for young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying land without further use. He urged Theresa May to abandon the quotas for affordable real estate in order to correct the "disgraceful situation in the housing market" in the UK.
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of important real estate reforms, including rent controls and the impossibility of eviction without good reason.
He also proposes to expand the powers of local councils in the field of construction of new housing.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I pledged to dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream – to making life better for every new generation.
This requires a change in our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always remain open to those who want to live, work and build their future here.
However, it can not be called fair the fact that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become unattainable. The problem of living in the open air still remains very painful."
Jack Ross: 'I want to be Scotland's head coach'
Sunderland head coach Jack Ross says he “seeks above all” to ever lead the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman set out to rebuild the club from the northeast of the country, which now ranks third in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning St. Mirren last season to the Scottish Premier League.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to the second team of Scotland, but that’s it,” said Ross during the program Sportsound on BBC Scotland radio.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the Scottish team play at Hampden Park, which always attracted me.
My only hope is to be successful as the club’s head coach.”
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former head coach of Alloa Athletic FC says that he did not feel the excitement of moving to a large club following such authoritative names, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley FC and Ipswich Town.
"At the current stage, I will consider that I have achieved success if the club returns to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and material and technical support, this club, without a doubt, corresponds to the level of the Premier League," he said.
“It will not be an easy task, but another result I will hardly consider to be successful for myself.”
Ross has been building a coaching career for only three years. Before that, he worked as a second coach at FC Dumbarton, and also spent 15 months at the coaching staff of FC Harts.
He then helped Alloa recover after the FC made it to the third division, and the following season with St. Mirren went from the departure stage to winning the first division title.
According to Ross, now he feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I found myself at a crossroads," he recalls, talking about the transition to Alloa FC.
“I honestly believed that coaching was more suitable for me than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was successful, I made good money on it and reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are a lot of challenges that you have to overcome every week.
I still face them, experiencing stress and tension, but as the head coach, I feel in my place.
I have always been interested in coaching. I have never felt more comfortable in my adult life than when I chose this profession."

Study: 17:30 on Sunday – the perfect time for a beer
Summer heat has helped to increase the revenue of British pubs, which are experiencing not the best times, but increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
Pub and bar sales were projected to increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues declined by 4.8%.
The author of the calculations Peter Martin from the organization CGA, engaged in consulting on business development, noted: "Thanks to the sunny weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cup, July passed in the same scheme as the previous month, when the revenue of restaurants went up by 2.8% of the business.
June's fall by 1.8% in July intensified.
Pubs and bars focused on serving drinks, so far have the best performance – the growth of their profits is equivalent to the losses of restaurants.
Pubs serving food were also affected by the heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are only interested in drinks.
In controlled pubs and bars, sales of beverages per month increased by 6.6%. At the same time, food sales decreased by 3%".
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hotel business analyst, said: “We’ve seen similar trends since late April.
Weather and large-scale social or sporting events remain the main factors influencing sales in the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to lose profits. An annual drop in sales of 4.8% is a particular concern amid the need to cut costs.
The long hot summer has not come at the best time for food-serving establishments. Let’s see if the milder temperature we observed in August can give them a much-needed rest.”
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, in July was 2.7%, reflecting a slowdown in the launch of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry indicator for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance indicators of 47 working groups whose total turnover exceeds <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. This is a generally accepted industry standard.
One in five children has a social media account hidden from their parents.
One in five children under the age of 11 have a social media account hidden from parents and teachers.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages on Instagram
This news has heightened concerns about the possible posting of sexual content
20% of students reported having a “main account” that they show their parents
One in five children, sometimes less than 11 years old, creates an account on social networks that hides from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages on Instagram, a social network for sharing photos.
This news has heightened concerns about the possible posting of sexual content.
20% of students reported having a clean “basic” account that they show their parents, as well as one or more private ones.
A mother who accidentally stumbled upon the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter saw a call “rape me”.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two social media profiles. Half of these children admitted that the additional account is secret.
HMC chairman Mike Buchanan said: “We are deeply concerned that many teenagers are eager to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Aileen Doyle will be a "representative of the interests of athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics
Aileen Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an independent director at the annual general board meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most titled track and field athlete. Council Chairman Ian Beatty called the move a great opportunity for those leading the sporting movement to take advantage of her broad experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Aylid enjoys great respect among the athletes of Scotland, the UK and the world. We are convinced that by bringing her to the board, athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously," Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I will be inspired to act as a representative of the interests of athletes. I hope that I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland."
The American, a four-time Olympic champion who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and now a sports columnist for the BBC, lost the opportunity to walk because of a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will be able to recover and how much.
Thanks to incredible efforts, I managed to recover completely. I learned to walk again and today I do dynamic exercises!
Thank you for your words of support!”
In advertising milk sucker women compared with cows – opinions of Internet users divided
The manufacturer of suction cups has faced a mixed reaction of Internet users to advertising, in which young mothers are compared to active cows.
To commemorate the release of a product dubbed “the world’s first silent natty milk sucker,” consumer goods tech company Elvie has released a humorous music video-style ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new sucker provides mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled coop to a song containing the words: "Yes, I feed myself, but I have no tail" and "As you can see, this is not a udder, but my breasts".
Then the choir sings: "Suck, suck to feed the children. Suck, suck, so as not to waste milk."
However, an advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page caused a heated discussion online.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the reaction of Internet users was ambiguous. Many noted that the advertising underestimated the "horrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
“It’s not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk. However, their children are taken from them a few days after birth," one of the users wrote.
Elvie milk sucker can be easily hidden in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "It's clear that it's traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not get them to advertise a milk sucker for women who need to feed their babies?"
Someone else added: “This advertising is very far from reality.”
Other users spoke in defense of the commercial. One of the women of the video seemed to be "very fun".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would definitely buy such a thing if I was still breastfeeding.
Sucking up the milk, I felt really like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I did not look for hidden content in it.
“Great product,” someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "Funny advertising focused on moms who suck milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertising is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women demonstrate the milk suction cups hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on the information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, the Elvie suction cup works completely quietly, has no wires or tubes and is easy to hide in a bra for feeding. Thanks to this, women can move freely, hold children and even go outside.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of the Mother advertising agency, commented on the situation: “The Elvie suction cup is such a revolutionary product that it required a bright and provocative presentation.
Drawing a parallel between women who squeeze milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the peculiarities of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new suction cup will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie’s suction cup has made headlines.
As part of the Fashion Week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product during a fashion show from fashion designer Marta Yakubovsky.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to place children in caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, the guardians were the undocumented immigrants themselves. Now they are afraid to jeopardize their own opportunity to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential carers and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the Bureau had arrested dozens of people who had applied for care for unaccompanied minors.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal history.
"About 80% of people who are carers or members of their households are in the country illegally. Many of them are foreigners who have committed offenses.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these people,” said Mr Albens.
According to the asylum workers, in order to deal with the cases of children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days as it used to be.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing instead of coming to court in person to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who, according to the court’s decision, do not have the right to obtain asylum will be deported quickly.
According to asylum workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed. This can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Human rights activists argue that these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological state of children.
They added that by moving children to a tent camp and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends, we risk aggravating the trauma that many of them have already suffered.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to immediately withdraw troops
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, so "they will be treated appropriately."
"They should leave immediately and not make conditions," he said at the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the “war on terror is virtually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The U.S. has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France sent more than 1,000 soldiers to the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Muallem assured that the country has created the right conditions for their return. He also accused "some Western countries" that those "spread unreasonable fears", because of which the refugees do not dare to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of people," he said.
“We are seeing an attempt to politicize a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help Syria rebuild the country until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity for political talks to continue.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish agreement, it was possible to prevent a large-scale offensive of the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against the jihadists, including the militants of the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, which "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee soon, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Muallem put forward conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying his work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected
According to this logic, Trump could be re-elected in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, he does not resign early after the scandal and impeachment.
Without a doubt, this would be “the most dramatic end to the presidency of all time”!
At the moment, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (to 1.05 million) on CNN and actually tripled (to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers per prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC cable was at the top of the list with 3.5 million viewers on the evenings when the main news was discussed.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s beyond our comprehension,” said Neil Behr, executive producer of the ABC drama Last Candidate, about a secretary of state who becomes president after a devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an experienced humorist writer and author of "Only funny moments: as well as a few harsh truths about penetrating the club of Hollywood men," offers a different theory.
She recalled a trip in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he said. That's the story Mrs. Scowell told me.
Chaos is fun.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, the stories from Washington are able to determine the future of the Rowe v. Wade case, the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Suspension is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say you're just trying to stay informed citizens when you watch a six-hour panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "well-informed" sources for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's ostrich skin jacket for $15,000.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
“The feeling of a reality show is partly due to the fact that you are fed something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the TV program “Pawnshop Stars”, about the rotations in the cast and daily plot twists in the show “Trump”, <0xD0><0x98><0xD0><0xB4><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xBA><0xD1><0x84><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB0> <0xD0><0xA4><0xD0><0xBB><0xD0><0x9B><0xD0><0xA4><0xD0><0x9B><0xD0><0xA0><0xD0><0x9C><0xD0><0x9B><0xD0><0x9D><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0x90>

When I was able to meet Mr. Fleiss this week at his house on the north coast of Kauai, there was warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn’t get away from the TV – not when Brett Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but I think they were right.”

External injections of funds into the toughest midterm elections in Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania has been sent additional infusions of money, because through the revision of the boundaries of the electoral districts, two incumbent congressmen compete for one seat.
In the fight for this suburban area of Pittsburgh, the borders of which have recently been changed, enters the Democrat, member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won in another district in the additional elections last spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent congressman, Republican Keith Roths, who now represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, whose borders largely coincide with the new 17th.
The maps were rewritten after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts were drawn in favor of Republicans contrary to the constitution.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district has sparked a fierce standoff between major party financial divisions, the Democratic Party’s Congressional Election Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee (NRCC).
The surname Lemba became very well known in Pennsylvania after winning with minimal advantage in the 18th District during the March additional congressional elections, which enjoyed widespread public attention.
This place belonged to Republicans for more than a decade. President Donald Trump won in this district with an advantage of 20 points.
Political experts gave a slight preference to Democrats.
In the United States considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but changed their minds
The diplomats recalled Washington's weak resistance to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which previously supported Beijing's position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. Previously, Trump also had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled staff hired by the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," department spokeswoman Gezer Nauert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, in particular in the field of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would be painful for this Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As a result of internal meetings, officials from the states of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity. A similar event was held last year, and it was seen as a step forward in efforts to contain the flow of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place. In fact, this is where consideration of the issue of sanctions against El Salvador stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence now plans to speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration considers this event very important.
At the same time, the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, because there were no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the internal discussions, which were reported by three U.S. officials, two of whom are diplomats, on condition of anonymity.
The information they provided was confirmed by a third-party analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn the history
The next problem may be the report of special prosecutor Robert Mueller about possible obstruction of justice on the part of trump, a strong confirmation of what can be found in the currently available public information.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is reportedly investigating a possible link between the Trump campaign and an attack on our voting system by Russia.
If Congressional influence passes into other hands, Trump will have to report to Congress, as well as to voters and, ultimately, to party members.
There are many “ifs” in this case, and I don’t want to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, as are his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler if the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is determined by such turning points, and the rampant movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are now waiting for several such breakthroughs.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr. Mueller’s fate depends?
Rosenstein got into trouble when the newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record conversations with the president and shared his thoughts on the incompatibility of Trump with the post.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
“How are we going to react if the investigation into Brett Kavanaugh, which the FBI recently launched, is not thorough enough or honest enough, or if Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Supreme Court is approved despite convincing sexual harassment and false testimony charges?
And above all, will we in the medium term vote for those members of Congress who can bring Trump to justice?
If we fail these trials, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Saturday candles on the swastika table.
With such an inheritance, can I not look with optimism to the future?"

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about meeting with the Viennese “Rapid”
Rangers FC hosts Rapid (Vienna) on Thursday. After an impressive draw in Spain in a game with Villarreal earlier this month, a victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with good chances of leaving Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrance was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a match with Villarreal, which ended 2:2. However, he believes that FC Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve more.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal are a strong team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came out to the game with the hope of getting something and scored one point.
Maybe at the end of the match we could go ahead, but in general, a draw can probably be considered a fair result.
In the first half, the opponent was the best, but after the break we corrected the situation in our favor.
On Thursday there will be another important confrontation in the Europa League.
I hope we will be able to get three points, but it will not be easy. Our future opponents showed a good result in their last game. However, we can count on the support of fans. I am sure that we will be able to give a fight and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a tough year, starting with my injuries and ending with changes at the club itself.
We have a great line-up, and all the guys are happy. Training is going well.
I hope we can move on, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize care for themselves, few spoke about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in Nationwide’s survey said they talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents talked about it with children.
“People want to be looked after by a family member, but they’re in no hurry to start a conversation about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
This is where you need to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care unless you tell your wishes to relatives in advance.
Consult with your counselor and family to determine where and how to receive care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Involve a financial advisor: He can advise on how to cover the related costs.
Sources of financing for long-term care include a traditional life insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, or self-sufficiency at your own expense (provided you have the money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: this will allow you to avoid legal harassment in advance.
Prepare a power of attorney for your representative, who will supervise your medical care and ensure that specialists will fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to do it in person.
In addition, we advise you to issue a power of attorney for the disposal of funds.
Choose a trustee who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills in case of your incapacity.
Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs urgent medical care, so he is taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down such information to be ready.
"It's not just about finance. It's about who the doctors are," Martin says.
What medications can be taken and
Who takes care of the dog.
Make a plan like that.”
In Ilfracombe, a man fired several times from a pneumatic rifle
The man fired several shots from a pneumatic rifle while returning home from a party.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at 2:30 a.m. British Summer Time, as "an accident".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries do not pose a threat to his life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, government officials said, but the death toll could rise.
Due to the failure of the communication means, officials involved in the provision of humanitarian aid can not get any information from the regency of Dongal, the area north of Palu, which is located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 points.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some basic facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Dongal located on the island of Sulawesi.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people as of 2017.
When the earthquake that caused the tsunami occurred, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
The Dongala is a regency that stretches for more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
As of 2017, the regency, an administrative region located in the lower part of the province, is home to approximately 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic sectors of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowal, on the opposite Sulawesi coast.
According to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit by the tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the Dongal tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit the western part of Dongal, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismicly active Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, located in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were in Aceh province.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake rocked southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake was recorded.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake rocked one of the islands of Mentawai, located near Sumatra, and caused a tsunami up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the regency of Pidijaya in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic due to the fact that people have not yet had time to forget the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the debris of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many houses, and thousands of tourists could not leave the island at once.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska’s former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by Alaska State Police on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing a report of a case of violence and resisting the arrest.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took away her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody in the detention center of Matanuska-Susitna with the right to make a bail in the amount of $ 500.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked if he would plead guilty, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, imposing up to one year's arrest and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class B misconduct, which is punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as obstructing the reporting of a case of domestic violence and carrying a weapon in a state of alcoholic intoxication when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for justifying her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, the earthquake caused a tsunami: killed hundreds of people
At least 384 people have been killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Communications and power supply networks have gone out of order, and the number of casualties may increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of the island of Sulawesi, located in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The video, which is distributed on social networks, shows the moment when the element struck.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach of the city of Palu, when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Demand Rare Death Penalty for New York Terrorist Suspect
In New York, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, a 30-year-old driver of a Home Depot pickup truck, reportedly drove on a bicycle lane along a highway in the West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began shooting down cyclists and pedestrians who were in his way.
According to a statement of intent filed in the Southern District of New York State to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court materials, each of these charges presupposes the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder with the aim of extortion that federal prosecutors usually put forward in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, who described Saipov’s crime as “horrible, cruel and malicious,” the attack was the result of “careful planning and premeditated deliberation.”
The victims to whom Saifulla Habibullaevich Saipov inflicted injuries, inflicted damage or killed were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Laure Decadte, Darren Drake, Ariel Ehrlich, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Dajandro.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been ten years since the Southern District of New York last filed a criminal case that is punishable by the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal execution was in New York City in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he did not regret what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to carry out an ISIS attack on videos he was watching on his phone.
Police said he also asked for an ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital ward.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and imposing life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only exacerbate the psychological trauma of all those affected,” Patton said.
The defense of Saipov previously also asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Farage needs to be put in charge of Brexit talks
During a protest at the Conservative Party congress, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, as one of the deputies Theresa May proposed his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have “already succeeded” if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
The attention to the problems that May faced in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks was further drawn by the fact that Conservative MPs who oppose leaving joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to implement the Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks from Brexit supporters, those opposed to leaving, and the EU.
Allies insist that it will not give up trying to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what it offers and “chaos”.
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihala, Mr. Bone said he wanted to "abandon Chequers".
He invited Mr Faraj to step out of the shadows and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for this, we would have already left,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We fought in world wars not to obey.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestion that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and do not want to go out is completely untrue.”
Conservative Party member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists, who actually walk the streets and fight for the votes of voters.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.”
In an address to Theresa May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their posts when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said politicians must "feel the pressure" if they are going to back down from the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people and our political elite,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political elite, which is planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing this country’s people’s army, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed Birmingham, and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved banners of "Conservatives Against Brexit" after the group launched this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives because, after the opening of the conference, security problems arose because of their party program.
“These are people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland,” he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There is nothing good about Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “think seriously” about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that during a general meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday, a Massachusetts Democratic representative spoke about her future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, ran in November for a second term against Republican member Jeff Deal, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is seen as the main candidate who can compete with trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a general meeting since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she planned to participate in the presidential election.
Warren responded that “it’s time for women to go to Washington and get the government to work, and for that, a woman should be at the head of the government.”
Arrested a suspect in the murder with a firearm basketball player "LSU Tigers" Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead outside the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
“Wade Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result,” Murphy’s Chief of Police J. Paul told reporters at 247sports on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, it was established that Simpson was at the crime scene, had a gun with him and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton County Police Department.
The six-foot-and-six-inch-tall Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 stars last season, playing an average of 17.4 minutes on the pitch, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton reduced the lag in the fight for the title of the world champion after the team decided to give him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas left Lewis Hamilton behind on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well with a pole position and almost bypassed Hamilton, who tried to hold his position in the first two corners and gave Vettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the tail of the race, which was about to solve everything.
The Mercedes driver made another lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton broke into the lead after a certain wheel-to-wheel maneuver, causing the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior because of the risk of being jammed, after a double maneuver he managed to break ahead in the third corner.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and remained in seventh place until the end of the first lap.
He then led most of the race, as he did not change tires to quickly reach the finish line and remove Kimi Räikkönen from fourth place.
In the end, he stopped at a pit stop on the 44th round, but could not increase the pace on the last eight, thanks to which Raikkonen took fourth place.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri taught full on all weekends and showed nobility when he gave me the opportunity to drive.
The team did an exceptional job to get first and second place,” Hamilton said.
Body language did not impress.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein for her firm stance in not disclosing the contents of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead expressed his opinion on events in the Senate that, he said, demonstrated human "sneakyness, vileness and deceit."
“The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that have been happening in the Senate over the last few days, is anger, you see evil people showing meanness, vileness and lying,” he said.
“You look at the publications and the disclosures, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer... Did you disclose the contents of the documents? – “What?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t disclose.”
Wait a minute.
Did we disclose?... No, we did not disclose,” he added, copying the behavior of the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing the accusations made by Ford against Cavanaugh, and its contents were made public in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I did not disclose the information received from her,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn’t break my promise.”
However, her objection did not seem to please the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "I tell you, her body language was not at all impressive.
She may not have done it, but I’ve never seen anyone do it any worse.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to return power by any means necessary.
You see meanness, vileness, they don’t care who to offend, who to cross over to gain power and control,” Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars – Belfast Giants, 5:3
"Giants" player Patrick Dwyer threw two pucks in the match against "Dundi"
The Dundee Stars rehabilitated for Friday's defeat in the elite league against the Belfast Giants, winning Saturday's match-response with a score of 5:3.
The Giants took an early lead in two goals thanks to throws by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney tied the score in the home game, and then Dwyer again took the Giants forward.
Dundee player Francois Bouchard tied the score, and Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
This is the third defeat in the season of the elite league team Adam Keefe, who received a will victory over "Dundi" with a score of 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth meeting of the teams in the season. Three previous matches won the team "Giants".
Dwyer scored the first puck in the fourth minute (3:35) after passing Kendall McFall, and four minutes later Beauvillier, who had received the puck from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period at the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sullivan returned the field hosts to the game, and at the sixteenth minute (15:16) Coney, having received a puck from Matt Marquardt, equalized the score.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants before the first break, dropping his second puck at the end of the first period.
The field masters regrouped, and Bouchard in the twenty-eighth minute (27:37) again leveled the score, throwing a puck when his team outnumbered.
Thanks to the efforts of Coney and Charles Corcoran, Nielsen brought Dundee forward for the first time at the end of the second period and secured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the final period.
On Friday, the Giants, which have already lost four of their last five games, will play an away match against Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller killed so hundreds of people on plane could avoid earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been named a hero after he helped take off a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people have been killed and many missing after a powerful earthquake that caused a tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong tremors continue to shake the area, many people found themselves under the rubble in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower, which rocked heavily, at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed in place to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was safely taken to the air.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
The representative of the Indonesian company-provider of air navigation services Johannes Sirright said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, according to the Australian news agency ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sorry to hear about this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as the country's disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Butong is restricted.
“The death toll could rise as many bodies are still under the debris and many cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, where mass burials will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft deliver aid and food.
Reza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency ambulances bring bodies every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Gelfand, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the people who survived this tragedy, but we do not know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air accident in Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after the fall of the plane in the lagoon, one man disappeared
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said that as of Saturday, it is not possible to find one passenger.
The airline says its representatives are trying to find the man and to do so, they are cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more detailed information about the passenger, for example, about his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane flew very low above the ground.
"It's very good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and the others managed to get to the emergency exits on a sinking plane, being to the waist in the water.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to upgrade the berth also helped with the rescue operation, bringing people ashore with an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in air accidents related to PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but Air Niugini is not on the list.
Analyst restores the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution opened a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone recordings to recreate the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulette, according to The Clarion Ledger, said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous allegations.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Sanford testified and stated that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in a Sanford pickup truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying because my pickup truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Roulette said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the text messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Gail said.
The defense is due to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The band The High Breed from Bristol argues that hip-hop has changed its nature – moved away from political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival of this trend in the United Kingdom thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit against the couple for dismissal, receiving a "racist" message
In New York, a nanny filed a lawsuit against the couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received an incorrectly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, comparing the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, who arrived for her first working day in 2016, was black.
“NO, ONE MORE DARK SKIRT,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Morris twice.
According to the New York Post, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman, realizing her mistake, felt "uncomfortable" and fired Ms. Maurice. She stated that their previous nanny, who was an African-American, did not do her job well and that in return she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Miss Morris was paid for one day of work and then sent home on Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple, hoping to get compensation for the dismissal in the amount of the fee that she would have received for six months of work with the spouses, for whom she was originally hired, albeit without a contract. She had to pay $350 per day.
“I want to show them that we don’t have to do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
In response to accusations that they were racist, the couple said Maurice’s dismissal was a wise decision because they feared they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children with a person you treated rudely, even if it wasn’t intentional?
Your baby?
DAMN."
Comparing the lawsuit to “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to a child just two months ago and had “not recovered yet.”
Would you take revenge on anyone after that?
This is a bad thing,” the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, a court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
According to the new letter, Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear who is able to speak.
Bond’s daughter Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to be published, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s published.
Now it’s funny, because we know about the huge success of the Paddington story.”
Speaking about her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before the little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, being optimistic that his work had been rejected, she shared how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release she simultaneously felt "joy and sadness" because her father had died a year ago.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
“He was a rather modest man and didn’t like to brag,” she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, like his own child, because when children achieve something, we are proud of them, although it is not theirs, not ours.
I think he looked at Paddington’s success that way.
Although Paddington was a work of his imagination, he always attributed success to him.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the 2nd Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Over called regularly, saying that everything was really bad, that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"And then Nad called me and told me she was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you."
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were gradually stopping working and leaving her body.
She died a while before everything was turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by people and families.
I really had to keep my hands on it.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, ignoring the harsh trials she had to endure.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I lowered my head and couldn’t hold back my tears.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to deeply sympathize with Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two grief-stricken women leave postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave postcards on the Welsh Bridge with phone numbers that people can call for support, as well as messages that would inspire them.
Miss Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydna, said that her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that this smile made any room lighter.”
But he quit his job before he died because he was “like in the dark.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother’s body after he committed suicide.
Miss Davis says, "I'm constantly afraid that it will have consequences."
Miss Davis created the postcards “so that people know that there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t shut yourself up, you need to talk.”
Miss Humphreys, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband Mark, with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas day, he finally gave up. When the children opened their gifts, he did not look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to survive it: "It imposed a devastating
should be on the family.
But we have to keep on living and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance: FBI opens investigation
“I thought that if we could get what we asked for – limited in time and nature of the investigation – we might reach some agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “crash” amid a hopeless loss of allegiance to the political party.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their unwillingness is related to time.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans will have problems, it will seriously complicate their attempts to bring their own man through the elections to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators asking them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who had worked at the White House under Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who had worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
The Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy for the post of Supreme Court Justice.
During Kim's rule, the number of defectors from North Korea "reduced"
After Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, the number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Pak Pyeong-seog, citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said the number of defectors last year was 1,127 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors were increased border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers who transport illegals are now demanding more money for it.
Pyongyang has refrained from making public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than the well-defended demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the issue of denuclearization, the negotiations on which have come to a standstill.
This came after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed in general to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of not making any progress since.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no talk of unilateral disarmament,” Ri Yong-ho said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve on Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was "unfit" for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I kept thinking that if a woman ever spoke like that, she would be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh behaved very emotionally, sometimes almost screaming and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly denounced Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him an “absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation” orchestrated by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his bias towards Democrats.
“I think that with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will personally withdraw his candidacy,” she said.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to impeach Cavanaugh if his guilt was confirmed, and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit to work not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Rowe v. Wade case because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the question of approval in office, Kavanaugh bypassed the question of whether he would overturn some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time when the judge will become a hysterical, biased person and we will say how wonderful it is,” Pelosi said.
Women need to have these weapons.
These are just words that contained months and years of accumulated rage, and she could not utter them without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued: "A woman who worked as an executive and helped me a lot said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had her own method. When she was angry and started crying, she said to her interlocutor, "You might think that I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
And I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was incredible.”
Tears are considered an acceptable outlet of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my clearest recollections of my first job in an office that was mostly male was when I once cried out with unspeakable anger, and an older woman – an unfriendly manager whom I had always been a little afraid of – grabbed me by the collar and pulled me onto the staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they got to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on board a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, a deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race, and one more candidate was the last thing they needed.”
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she made a promise to herself that she would not participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret supporting men for $1,000, gave her only $250.
“They think I’m going to get a discount?” she asked.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, disappointment with the system, which made it very difficult to collect money and forced her to focus not so much on voters as on members of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as anger at sexism.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalls the reaction of the press.
You would think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I was wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
“Did she cry?”
How a U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and although it is still far from its end, in the long run, a split between the countries could benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning shot earlier this year, taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation worsened this week due to new tariffs on goods totaling $ 200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3> 150 billion), which actually tax half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has paid back each time with the same coin, recently imposing duties of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to take similar U.S. measures, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to miss an opportunity in the near future to keep that promise.
To force Washington to retreat means to accept the demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, experts believe that if Beijing takes good advantage of the situation, pressure in the trade war with the United States could bring China an advantage in the long run, reducing the interconnectedness of the two economies.
“A swift policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to a sharp economic downturn in any of the countries, and that actually poses a greater threat than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an analyst who deals with Asian-related issues at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Foreign Minister Says Syria 'Ready' to Return Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they will not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that support the insurgency.
Europe secures victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 when they beat the US team with a final score of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tournament, broke his first long shot on the 16th hole of the pair-3 in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds and became one of four players to ever pass 5-0-0 since the tournament began in the modern format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit suffered a 5:4 defeat from the player with the lowest rating in the European team Turbyern <0xC3><0x85>lesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, ranked first in the world rankings, lost 2:1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup tournament for the last time.
Spaniard Sergio García, a veteran of the Ryder Cup, who has participated in the tournament eight times, became the European who won the tournaments the most times in all time, bringing in 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t do anything today.
It was a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m so happy to have the cup back.
It’s the credit of the team and I’m glad that I was able to help,” Garcia said, without restraining his emotions, after winning in Europe.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Rehm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2-1 singles match on Sunday.
“I feel an incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” Ram, 23, said.
In France, Woods lost all four matches and now holds a career record for the Ryder Cup 13–21–3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 Major tournaments, behind only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to reach the fairway area, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finow, who showed high-end golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said of his team after a disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we did not dominate Europe for long.
We fought.
I take my hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We’re regrouping, I’m working with the U.S. Professional Golfers Association and the Ryder Cup tournament committee, and we’re moving forward.
I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their captain.
We cannot but praise them.
We lost."
